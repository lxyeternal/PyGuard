  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and assess their validity, consistency, and the assigned scores.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple variable assignment with a comment.\n- The comment 'PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE' is consistently noted as a directive for pytest behavior, not malicious.\n- No external data, inputs, or outputs are involved.\n- No obfuscation, malicious patterns, or security-sensitive data are present.\n- All reports agree on benignity and assign a malware score of 0, security risk of 0, and obfuscated score of 0.\n- The purpose across reports is to define a version constant, likely for testing or configuration.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code is **not** malicious.\n- No evidence of code injection, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n- The comment is a pytest directive, not an attack vector.\n- The code is static, with no data flows or external dependencies.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- No logical errors or reasoning flaws are apparent.\n- The reports correctly interpret the code as benign.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Score Analysis:\n- All reports assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, which is appropriate.\n- The confidence is 1, justified given the simplicity and clarity.\n- The purpose of the code is straightforward.\n\n### Potential for higher risk or malware:\n- Since there's no malicious behavior, malware score remains 0.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present, so obfuscated=0 is correct.\n- The comment might influence pytest behavior but does not pose a security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Note:** The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scoring aligns with the analysis. There are no discrepancies or concerns that warrant adjustment.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a straightforward, harmless constant declaration with a pytest directive comment, serving as a configuration marker.",
