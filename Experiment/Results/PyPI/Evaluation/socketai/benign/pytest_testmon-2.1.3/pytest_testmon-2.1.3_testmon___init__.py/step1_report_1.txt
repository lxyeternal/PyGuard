  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data could cause harm are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static assignment.",
  "anomalies": "The comment 'PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE' suggests an intent to influence pytest behavior, possibly to prevent rewriting of test files, but it's a comment and does not affect execution. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple assignment statement with a comment, with no complex logic or data handling. There are no indications of malicious behavior or obfuscated code. The presence of the comment may be a marker or directive for testing frameworks but does not introduce security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a simple configuration or marker. No malicious or security issues are detected.",
