  "purpose": "Define a constant string indicating a version for pytest to prevent rewriting.",
  "sources": "None (no input or data reading observed).",
  "sinks": "None (no data output or untrusted data handling observed).",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a special comment 'PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE' which might influence test behavior, but in itself is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single comment and a variable assignment. The comment suggests a directive for pytest to not rewrite tests, which is a known practice in testing environments. The variable 'TESTMON_VERSION' is assigned a version string, which appears to be a straightforward constant definition. No code injection, malicious behavior, or suspicious patterns are present. The overall structure is simple and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, serving as a version indicator with a pytest directive comment. No malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation are detected.",
