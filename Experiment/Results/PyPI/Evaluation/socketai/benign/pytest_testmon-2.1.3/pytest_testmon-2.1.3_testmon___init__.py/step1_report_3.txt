{
  "purpose": "The code defines a constant variable for a version string related to testing, likely used for version control or compatibility checks.",
  "sources": "No input or external data sources are read in this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling is present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or source-to-sink paths since the code only assigns a string to a variable.",
  "anomalies": "The only notable element is the string 'PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE', which appears to be a directive or flag related to pytest behavior; no malicious activity is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment and a single variable assignment. The comment suggests that pytest should not rewrite certain test files. The variable TESTMON_VERSION stores a version string. There are no functions, data handling, or network operations. No obfuscated code, malicious patterns, or security-sensitive data is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves as a simple configuration or annotation for testing behavior. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
