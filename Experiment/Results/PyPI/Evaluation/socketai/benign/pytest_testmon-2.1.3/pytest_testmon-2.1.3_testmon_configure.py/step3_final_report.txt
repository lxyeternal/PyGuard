  "purpose": "Utility functions for managing test configuration options, environment detection (debugger, coverage), and generating status messages related to test monitoring tools.",
  "sources": "Options dictionary (options), sys.gettrace() for debugger detection, import statements for coverage tracers",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; internal option processing and environment checks",
  "flows": "Options are read to determine reasons for deactivation; environment detection influences message generation",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard environment detection and options handling",
  "analysis": "The code performs benign environment detection and configuration management for testing tools. It uses standard practices such as sys.gettrace() for debugger detection and fallback imports for coverage tracers. No external network, file, or data exfiltration operations are present. The functions are straightforward, with clear purposes, and do not contain obfuscation or malicious payloads. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's benign nature. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard utility for test environment detection and configuration management. It does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
