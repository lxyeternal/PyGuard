  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for source code integrity verification and analysis, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), primarily due to subprocess usage which is controlled and static. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for its intended purpose."
