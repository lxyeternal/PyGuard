  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe database interface for test management. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity are detected. The only operation that could be viewed as risky is the deletion of the datafile during version upgrades, which is a common practice. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2), justified by routine file and database operations."
