{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up and install a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads the script execution context in the '__main__' block to trigger setup.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present in the code.",
  "flows": "Execution flow is straightforward: when run as a script, it calls setup(). No data flows from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected. The code is minimal and standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and executes 'setup()' if run directly. It contains no external input handling, no malicious code, and no suspicious behavior. The code appears to be a typical minimal setup script for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It simply invokes the setuptools setup process when executed.",
