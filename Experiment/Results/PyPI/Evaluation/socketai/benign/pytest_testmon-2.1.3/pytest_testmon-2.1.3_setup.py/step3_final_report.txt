  "purpose": "A minimal Python setup script using setuptools to configure package installation.",
  "sources": "The import of setuptools and the call to setup() within the __main__ guard.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "The code imports setuptools and executes setup() when run as main; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of parameters, external data, or dynamic code; no obfuscation or secrets; very straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard boilerplate for Python packaging, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It does not read external data, execute dynamic code, or contain obfuscation. The setup() call is empty, indicating default configuration. No signs of malware, backdoors, or security issues are present. The code's simplicity and adherence to common pattern justify a malware score of 0, security risk of 0, and obfuscation score of 0. The high confidence score reflects the clarity and benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python setup script with no security risks or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
