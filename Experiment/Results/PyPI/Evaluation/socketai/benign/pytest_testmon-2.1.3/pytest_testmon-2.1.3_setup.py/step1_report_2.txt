  "purpose": "This code is used to set up and install a Python package via setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the environment to determine if it's run as the main module (__main__).",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks; the setup() function may perform package installation, but no untrusted data is handled.",
  "flows": "The code flows from the __name__ check to calling setup() with default parameters; no untrusted data flow is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is minimal and standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the setuptools library and calls setup() if run as the main program. No input or data manipulation occurs, and no malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The code is a typical minimal setup script for Python packaging, with no embedded malicious logic or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply invokes setuptools to prepare the package installation.",
