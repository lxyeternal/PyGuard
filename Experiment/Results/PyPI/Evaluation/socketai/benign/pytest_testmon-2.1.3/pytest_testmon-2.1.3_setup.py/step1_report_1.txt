{
  "purpose": "This code is used to set up a Python package installation process using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module name and configuration data from setup() when executed as a script.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks; the setup() function can install files or packages, but in this context, it is only invoked without arguments.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code simply calls setup() with default parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard, with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual constructs. No obfuscation or suspicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() within the main guard. There are no parameters passed to setup(), indicating a basic setup script. It lacks any data input, environment variable use, or external communication. It is a typical, benign package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and intended for legitimate package distribution.",
