  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data is sent to external systems, files, or network endpoints.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows, input-output operations, or data processing within this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for a setup script; no suspicious or unusual behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setup' function from the setuptools library and calls it if the script is run directly. This is a common pattern for Python packaging. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious behavior. The code's simplicity suggests it is a legitimate setup script with no embedded malware or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward, standard setup script for Python packaging with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
