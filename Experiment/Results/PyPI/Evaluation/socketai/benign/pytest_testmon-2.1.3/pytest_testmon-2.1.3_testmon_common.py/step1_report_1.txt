  "purpose": "Utility functions for system package management, logging, and Git repository introspection.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata, environment variables, and file contents for Git information.",
  "sinks": "File reading operations, especially reading .git/HEAD and refs/heads/* files.",
  "flows": "From package metadata collection to string output; from Git files to branch or commit hashes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors observed. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors. Use of standard libraries only.",
  "analysis": "The code imports system libraries to gather system package info, employs regex for version normalization, and accesses Git repository metadata by reading files. No external data is processed unsafely. No dynamic code execution, no injection points, and no suspicious network activity or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code relies on standard, safe file IO operations and package metadata access. The only noteworthy activity is reading Git repository data and package info, which are standard operations. No obfuscated code, malware signatures, or malicious intent identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of utility functions for environment introspection, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
