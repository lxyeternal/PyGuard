  "purpose": "Utility functions for retrieving system package information and inspecting Git repository metadata, including branch and commit hash.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata via importlib.metadata or pkg_resources; filesystem reads of .git directory files (HEAD, refs/heads/*).",
  "sinks": "None; all operations are read-only filesystem and package metadata access, with no untrusted input processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "Package info retrieval flows from package metadata to string formatting; Git functions read files (HEAD, refs) to extract branch and commit info; no untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected; regex in drop_patch_version is standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard, read-only filesystem and package metadata operations using safe libraries. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The filesystem reads are limited to known directories and files, with no processing of untrusted input. The regex used for version normalization is straightforward. The functions are utility in nature, designed for environment inspection, and do not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for environment and repository inspection, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is correctly set to 0, and the low security risk scores (0 to 0.2) are justified given the read-only filesystem operations and standard practices.",
