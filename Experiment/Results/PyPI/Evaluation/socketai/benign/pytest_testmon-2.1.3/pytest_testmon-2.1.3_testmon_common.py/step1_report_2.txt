  "flows": "get_system_packages_raw() retrieves installed packages; get_system_packages() filters and formats package info; git_path() searches for .git directory; git_current_branch() reads HEAD file; git_current_head() reads branch SHA.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets or credentials; standard use of filesystem and package metadata functions; no obfuscated code or dynamic execution; no external network communication; standard logging setup.",
  "analysis": "The code performs package listing and version processing, along with Git repository inspection through filesystem reads. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. Functions are straightforward, with no data leaks, backdoors, or malicious code. Usage of environment and package info is safe. Logging setup is standard. No anomalies or obfuscation present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for package management and Git info retrieval, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
