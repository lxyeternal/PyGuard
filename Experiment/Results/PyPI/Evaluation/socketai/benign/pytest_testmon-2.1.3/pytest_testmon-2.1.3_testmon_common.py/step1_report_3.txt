{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for system package inspection, version normalization, and Git repository navigation.",
  "sources": "Data sources include importlib.metadata or pkg_resources for package info, environment variables, and filesystem reads for Git directories and files.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve reading Git HEAD and refs files, and generating package lists, but no data is written or transmitted in this code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from package metadata sources and filesystem reads, with no untrusted input manipulation or dangerous data flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. The code mainly performs standard system and Git utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports system package info depending on Python version, constructs package lists excluding certain packages, normalizes package versions, and navigates filesystem to locate Git repositories and their current branch and head SHA. All operations are read-only, with no external data transmission, and no obfuscated or suspicious logic observed. Functions use standard Python modules and practices for filesystem and package management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions for package and Git repository inspection without any malicious behavior or security risks. No indicators of malware, malicious data leakage, or sabotage are present.",
