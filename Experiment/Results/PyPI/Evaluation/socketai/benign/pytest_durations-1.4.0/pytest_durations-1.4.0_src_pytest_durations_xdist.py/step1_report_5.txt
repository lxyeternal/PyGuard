{
  "purpose": "The code is a mixin class for pytest-xdist to collect and merge test duration measurements across distributed test nodes.",
  "sources": "Imports of pytest and related types, session and node attributes, and measurement data structures within class methods.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data leading to security vulnerabilities or data leaks; no external communication, no sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Measurement data is collected in session or worker nodes and merged via _extend_measurements, with no external or unsafe data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors. The code is standard for pytest plugin extensions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a pytest plugin mixin to handle measurement data across distributed test sessions. It retrieves and stores data within session and worker attributes, merging measurements at the end of sessions. There are no external inputs or outputs, no code injection points, and no data handling that could leak or be exploited maliciously. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose related to test measurement collection.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign pytest plugin extension for collecting and merging performance measurements. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code structure and logic are clear and typical for this purpose.",
