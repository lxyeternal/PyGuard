{
  "purpose": "Provides a function to return the current monotonic time in seconds, with optional configuration of the freezegun library if installed.",
  "sources": "Importing 'monotonic' from the 'time' module; optional import of 'freezegun' library.",
  "sinks": "The 'get_current_ticks' function returns data; no untrusted input sources or data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "The function directly returns the monotonic time; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code conditionally imports and configures 'freezegun' if available, which is a testing library used to manipulate time. This could be used to control or manipulate system time in tests, but on its own, it's not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code safely retrieves monotonic time, a standard and secure method for measuring elapsed time. The optional 'freezegun' import and configuration are typical for testing purposes and do not introduce malicious behavior. No suspicious or malicious activity detected. The code's structure is straightforward and does not perform any harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, mainly used for retrieving monotonic time, with optional time manipulation configuration for testing. No malicious intent or security risks detected.",
