{
  "purpose": "Define a type alias for a nested dictionary structure related to measurements.",
  "sources": "None (no data input or reading in the provided code).",
  "sinks": "None (no data output, external calls, or untrusted data handling).",
  "flows": "No data flow present as the code only declares a type alias without runtime logic.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious or unusual patterns; the code is straightforward type alias declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports typing constructs and defines a type alias 'MeasurementsT' as a nested dictionary with string keys mapping to dictionaries with string keys and list of float values. It contains no executable logic, no input/output handling, and no suspicious patterns or embedded secrets. The code appears to be standard type annotation for later use in a larger project.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple type alias declaration without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
