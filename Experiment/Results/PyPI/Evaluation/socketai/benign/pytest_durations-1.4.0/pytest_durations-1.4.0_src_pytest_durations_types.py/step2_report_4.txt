  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**1. Confirmation of Issues Present in the Code:**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is a simple type alias declaration without executable logic, data input/output, or malicious constructs. The code is straightforward and does not contain any issues or vulnerabilities.\n\n**2. Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**  \n- The reports are consistent and thorough in describing the benign nature of the code.  \n- They correctly note the absence of suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.  \n- No flaws or mistakes are evident in their reasoning.\n\n**3. Scores Given to Each Issue:**  \n- All reports assign confidence = 1, obfuscated = 0, malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.  \n- These scores are reasonable given the code's simplicity and benign nature.  \n- Since the code is purely a type alias declaration with no runtime behavior, these scores are appropriate.\n\n**4. Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**  \n- The highest risk score is 0, indicating no security concern.  \n- This is justified because the code contains no executable logic, no external data handling, and no malicious intent.  \n- Therefore, no adjustment needed here.\n\n**5. Malware Score Consideration:**  \n- All reports assign malware = 0, which is correct.  \n- The code does not perform any malicious actions, embed secrets, or obfuscate.  \n- The malware score is appropriately low.\n\n**6. Challenging Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \n- The reports avoid assumptions and correctly interpret the code as benign.  \n- No claims of vulnerabilities are made without evidence.\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**  \n- The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis.  \n- No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n**Estimated Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.  \n**Estimated Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.  \n**Estimated Risk Score:** 0 — no security risk, no vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Remarks:\n\nThe reports are accurate and well-reasoned. The code is a standard type alias declaration for type hinting purposes, with no security concerns.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is benign.  \n- The scores assigned are appropriate.  \n- No adjustments needed.",
