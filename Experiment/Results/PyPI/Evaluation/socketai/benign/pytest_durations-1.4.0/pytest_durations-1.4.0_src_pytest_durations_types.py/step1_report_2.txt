  "purpose": "Define a type alias for a nested dictionary structure representing measurements.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths involving untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of a type alias declaration with no executable or dynamic content; no suspicious or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports typing components and defines a type alias 'MeasurementsT' for a nested dictionary structure. There are no data input, output, or processing steps. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward and standard for type annotations.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a simple, benign type alias declaration used for type hinting in Python. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
