  "purpose": "Define a type alias for a nested dictionary structure with string keys and list of float values.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data sources; only a type alias declaration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data flow or external interactions.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is a static type alias with no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward type alias with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Dict and List from typing, then creates a type alias MeasurementsT for a nested dictionary structure. It contains no executable logic, data handling, or external interactions. The code is standard for type hinting and does not include any suspicious or malicious constructs. The simplicity and clarity indicate no security risks or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, and the assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward type alias declaration with no security concerns or malicious behavior. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is justified. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
