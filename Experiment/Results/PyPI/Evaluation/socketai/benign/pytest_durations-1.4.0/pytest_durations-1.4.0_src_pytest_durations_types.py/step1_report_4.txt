  "purpose": "Define a type alias 'MeasurementsT' for nested dictionaries with string keys and list of float values, used for data organization.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input or external data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No output, data storage, or external data transmission occurs in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow or data processing operations are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious constructs are found.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple type alias definition using Python's typing module. It does not include executable logic, data handling, or external interactions. There are no input sources, sinks, or data flows. It is a straightforward, safe type annotation declaration with no potential for malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign type alias definition for nested dictionaries containing lists of floats. There are no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
