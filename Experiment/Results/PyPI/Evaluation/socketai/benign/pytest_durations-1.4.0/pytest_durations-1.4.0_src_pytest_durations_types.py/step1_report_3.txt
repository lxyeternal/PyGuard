  "purpose": "Define a type alias for a nested dictionary structure representing measurements.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output functions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths between sources and sinks, as code only defines a type alias.",
  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward, with no unusual constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports type annotations and defines a type alias for a nested dictionary structure. There are no data inputs, no data processing, no network operations, or any potentially malicious behavior. The code appears to be a simple, benign type definition intended for type hinting in larger codebases.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign type alias definition with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
