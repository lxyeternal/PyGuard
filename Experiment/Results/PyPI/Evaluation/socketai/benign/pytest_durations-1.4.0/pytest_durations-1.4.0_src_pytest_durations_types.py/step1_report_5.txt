{
  "purpose": "Define a type alias 'MeasurementsT' representing a nested dictionary structure with string keys and list of float values.",
  "sources": "No data input or data reading operations are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data output or untrusted data handling is present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths are present, as the code only defines a type alias.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a straightforward type alias declaration with no unusual or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'Dict' and 'List' from 'typing' for type hinting. It then creates a type alias 'MeasurementsT' for a nested dictionary: keys are strings, mapping to dictionaries with string keys and list of float values. There are no executable statements, data handling, or obfuscated features. The code is standard for type hinting in Python and contains no malicious or security-relevant elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple type alias definition for organizing nested dictionary data structures. It poses no security risk, contains no malware, and appears to be standard, benign code for type annotations.",
