  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issues Present?** No. The code is a simple import and version string assignment, with no malicious activity or security risk.  \n- **Errors/Flaws?** The only note is the unused import, which is common and not problematic.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, security risk is 0, which is appropriate. The confidence is 1, which is justified. No change needed.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issues Present?** No. Similar minimal code with benign intent.  \n- **Errors/Flaws?** No anomalies or suspicious patterns.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; security risk is 0. Scores are consistent with the benign nature. No change needed.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issues Present?** No. Again, just import statements and version string.  \n- **Errors/Flaws?** No anomalies or suspicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; security risk is 0. Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issues Present?** No. The code is minimal and standard.  \n- **Errors/Flaws?** No anomalies or suspicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; security risk is 0. Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issues Present?** No. Same pattern—import and version string.  \n- **Errors/Flaws?** No anomalies.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; security risk is 0. Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- All reports describe very minimal, standard code snippets that are typical in package setup or plugin configuration.\n- There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code.\n\n### Final notes:\n- Since the code is purely import statements and a version string, the malware score should remain at 0.\n- The obfuscated score should be 0, as there's no evidence of obfuscation.\n- The security risk score should be 0, given the benign nature.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code's content. No modifications are necessary.",
