  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the associated code snippets.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All snippets are extremely minimal, consisting solely of import statements from a pytest plugin module and a version string.\n- The import statements include `# noqa: F401`, indicating that the imports are intentionally unused, which is common in package setup or plugin registration code.\n- No data flows, network activity, or external data processing are present.\n- No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code appears to be standard for Python package configuration or plugin setup.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Import from `pytest_durations.options`, define version.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity; standard package code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Verdict:** Correct and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Benign, standard plugin configuration.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Import functions for pytest configuration.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity; typical test setup code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious intent; standard import and versioning.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n- **Security Risk Score:** All are 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Note on risk scores:** Since the code is purely import statements and version declarations with no suspicious patterns, setting risk scores higher than 0.5 would be unjustified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 for all reports — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 for all reports — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0 for all reports — no security risks identified.\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's nature.**",
