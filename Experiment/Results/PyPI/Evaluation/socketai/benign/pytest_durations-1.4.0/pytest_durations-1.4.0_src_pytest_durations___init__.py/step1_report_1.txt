{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific functions from the 'pytest_durations.options' module and defines a version string for the package or module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'pytest_durations.options' and the '__version__' string assignment.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data output, network communication, or sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow or untrusted data source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "The import is unused (indicated by '# noqa: F401'), which is common in some codebases but can sometimes be a sign of incomplete or obfuscated code. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single import statement and a version string declaration. The import is explicitly marked to ignore unused import warnings. There are no functions, network calls, or data handling operations. The minimal nature of the code suggests it is part of a larger module and does not contain malicious behavior on its own.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a standard part of a package, defining its version and importing necessary options. No suspicious or malicious activity is detected.",
