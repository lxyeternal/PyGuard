  "purpose": "Import functions from pytest_durations.options and define a version string, likely for plugin setup or configuration.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'pytest_durations.options' with '# noqa: F401', and the '__version__' string assignment.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communication; code is limited to imports and a version declaration.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code does not process or transmit data.",
  "anomalies": "Unused import statements marked with '# noqa: F401'; no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of import statements and a version string. The imports are unused, which is typical in plugin or setup files. No network activity, data handling, or malicious behavior is present. The code is straightforward and clear, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for plugin or package setup, and contains no malicious or security risks. The scores reflect this accurately.",
