  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the reasoning, and the assigned scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe minimal, standard import statements from a pytest plugin module and a version string.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks is found.\n- The import statements are marked with `# noqa: F401`, indicating they are intentionally unused, which is common in plugin or setup code.\n- The code snippets are very simple, with no data flow, network activity, or sensitive data handling.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and issues:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly identify that the code is minimal, standard, and benign. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly interpret the code as benign, and no logical flaws are apparent.\n\n- **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n  All reports have `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `confidence: 1`. These are reasonable given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.\n\n---\n\n### Justification of risk scores:\n- Since all reports assign a `malware` score of 0 and `securityRisk` of 0, and the code is straightforward, these scores are appropriate.\n- The `obfuscated` score is 0, which aligns with the lack of obfuscation.\n- The `confidence` is 1, indicating high certainty that the code is benign, which is justified.\n\n### Any anomalies or assumptions?\n- The reports mention the use of `# noqa: F401`, which is typical for unused imports in setup or plugin code. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- No claims of malicious intent are supported by the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n- The code is typical for plugin or package setup files, and nothing indicates malicious intent.\n- The minimal nature of the code makes it unlikely to conceal malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nBased on the detailed review, I agree with the provided scores. The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese are consistent with the reports and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways consider the broader context of the entire package. However, based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious or risky behavior.",
