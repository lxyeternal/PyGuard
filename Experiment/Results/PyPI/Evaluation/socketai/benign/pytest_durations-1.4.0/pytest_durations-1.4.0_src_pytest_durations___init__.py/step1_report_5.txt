{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific functions from the pytest_durations.options module and sets a version string, likely for configuration or version tracking purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'pytest_durations.options'. The code also defines a version string '__version__'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow or untrusted input handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "The import statement is standard; the version string is hardcoded, which is common practice. No unusual or suspicious code constructs, backdoors, or secret credentials are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two functions for pytest plugin options, which suggests it's part of a testing plugin or configuration. The import itself is straightforward and not suspicious. The version string is a simple hardcoded value, typical for versioning. No external data input, environmental variable handling, or malicious constructs are present. The code is minimal and adheres to standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, consisting of standard import statements and a version identifier. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
