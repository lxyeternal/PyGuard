  "purpose": "Importing specific functions from a pytest plugin for configuring test durations",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'pytest_durations.options' module",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing identified",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports two functions from an external pytest plugin module, which is typical in test configurations. The version string indicates the package version but is not inherently malicious. The import statement includes a comment to ignore linter warnings. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code is minimal and standard for test setup purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement used for test configuration without any malicious intent or security risks identified. It appears to be standard, benign code for setting up test options.",
