  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code snippets, and evaluate the provided scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the same or very similar code snippets: importing functions from `'pytest_durations.options'` and defining a `__version__` string.\n- The code is minimal, standard for package or plugin setup, and does not include any network activity, data handling, or malicious code.\n- No anomalies such as obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior are identified.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- The security risk scores are also 0, consistent with the lack of any security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Logical Consistency:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code snippets. The code is straightforward and standard.\n- **Errors or flaws:** The only minor note is the use of `# noqa: F401` to suppress unused import warnings. This is common and not suspicious.\n- **Scores:**\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0, correct given the code clarity.\n  - **Malware:** 0, consistent with no malicious activity.\n  - **Risk:** 0, appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Specific points per report:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Purpose and analysis are accurate.  \n- The high confidence (1) is justified.  \n- No issues with scores; they are reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Same reasoning applies.  \n- No anomalies or suspicious signs.  \n- Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Similar to above, with consistent conclusions.  \n- No concerns.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Correctly identifies the minimal, benign nature.  \n- Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Same as above, consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Potential Improvements:\n\n- The reports could mention that the import functions are not used within this snippet, but this is already noted.\n- Since all code snippets are identical or very similar, the scores should remain consistent across reports.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0, as the code does not pose any security risk.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Assessment:\n\nBased on the provided reports and code snippets, I agree with the assigned scores. The code is benign, standard, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is a simple, harmless import and version declaration, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores reflect this correctly.",
