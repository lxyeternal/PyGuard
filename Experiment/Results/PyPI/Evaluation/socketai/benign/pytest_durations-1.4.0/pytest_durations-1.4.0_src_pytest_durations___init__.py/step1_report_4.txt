{
  "purpose": "Importing specific functions from the pytest_durations.options module, likely to extend or modify pytest behavior.",
  "sources": "The imported functions 'pytest_addoption' and 'pytest_configure' are not used within this snippet, but they are sources if used elsewhere.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions based on external input.",
  "flows": "No flow of data from source to sink occurs within this snippet; no dynamic or external data processing is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code only imports functions and assigns a version string, with no suspicious or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of an import statement and a version assignment. The import statement does not execute any code or perform any actions; it merely imports functions for potential later use. The version string is a common practice for package versioning. There is no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, data leakage, or malicious code. The code appears typical for a Python package module setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, performing straightforward imports and version assignment with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
