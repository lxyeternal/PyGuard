  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe minimal, straightforward import statements from a pytest plugin module (`pytest_durations.options`) and a version string.\n- No code execution, data handling, network activity, or external data sources are involved.\n- The import statements are marked with `# noqa: F401`, indicating the imports are intentionally unused, which is common in plugin or setup code.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious activity are evident across all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and potential issues:\n- The code snippets are simple import statements and a version string assignment.\n- The imports are unused, but that is typical in plugin setup files.\n- No code flows, data sinks, or external communication are present.\n- No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are detected.\n\n### Error, flaws, or mistakes:\n- The only minor point is the unused import (`# noqa: F401`), which could be considered unnecessary, but it's a common practice in such cases.\n- No security flaw or malicious activity is indicated.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, consistent with the straightforward, clear code.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- Not applicable here; all code is benign, minimal, and standard.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the described code snippets.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Risk score:** 0 for all reports.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\nGiven the nature of this code, I agree with the existing scores. There is no indication of malicious intent or security risk.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Keep malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0.\n- No further action needed.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code snippets are standard, benign parts of a package or plugin setup. They do not pose security risks, contain malware, or exhibit obfuscation. The reports are accurate in their assessments.",
