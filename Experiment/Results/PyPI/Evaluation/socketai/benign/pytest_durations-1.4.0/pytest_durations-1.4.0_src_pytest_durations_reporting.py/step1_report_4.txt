{
  "purpose": "The code processes and generates a report of timing measurements for functions or code segments, including calculating statistical summaries and formatting output.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a dictionary 'measurements' containing timing values; no external untrusted input sources are explicitly used.",
  "sinks": "The code writes data to tuples, lists, and string formatting functions; no external sinks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'measurements' dictionary through list comprehensions and functions that generate report rows, with no external untrusted input or side effects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors, are present. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or system modifications are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly focuses on statistical analysis and report generation for timing measurements. It uses standard Python functions, data structures, and formatting techniques. No external inputs are processed insecurely. There are no apparent attempts to conceal malicious behavior or access sensitive data.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward utility for generating performance reports based on collected timing data. It exhibits no signs of malicious intent, security vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. The overall security risk is minimal.",
