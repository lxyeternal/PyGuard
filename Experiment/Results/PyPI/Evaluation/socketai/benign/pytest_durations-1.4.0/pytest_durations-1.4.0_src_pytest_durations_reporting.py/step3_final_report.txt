{
  "purpose": "Generate a performance report summarizing timing measurements, including headers, detailed timing rows, and footer totals.",
  "sources": "Measurement data dictionary with function/operation names as keys and lists of timing floats as values.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; data is processed internally for report generation.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the measurements dictionary through filtering, sorting, statistical calculations, and formatting into report rows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external data handling detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python libraries to process timing data, filtering by minimum duration, sorting by total sum, and computing median, min, max, and sum for each measurement. It constructs header, detailed, and footer report rows, formatting timing values as timedelta strings. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The logic is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward performance reporting utility with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; minor security risk scores of 0.1 can be conservatively justified but are slightly overestimated given the code's nature. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
