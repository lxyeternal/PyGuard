{
  "purpose": "Generate performance reports from measurement data, including timing metrics and summaries.",
  "sources": "Input measurements dictionary, optional parameters for filtering durations and minimum duration.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted input; no data is written to external systems or used in security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Measurements data flows from input to report row creation, with internal processing for sorting and aggregating data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious logic; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code processes timing measurements, producing formatted report rows with timing statistics. It includes functions for header, footer, and data rows, with sorting and filtering capabilities. All operations are standard data processing and formatting tasks. There are no code injection points, external network communications, or data leaks. The functions rely solely on in-memory data and standard library functions. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, benign reporting utility for timing measurements. No malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are detected based on the provided code.",
