{
  "purpose": "This code generates performance reports based on timing measurements of various functions or code blocks.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'measurements' dictionary, which contains timing data as floats.",
  "sinks": "The code constructs report rows, performs sorting, and computes aggregates; no direct data leaks or external effects are evident.",
  "flows": "Input data from 'measurements' flows into list comprehensions and is used for sorting, filtering, and aggregation to generate report data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. The code primarily performs data processing and formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code processes timing measurements to produce formatted report rows, including headers, detailed timings, and footer totals. It uses standard library functions like min, max, median, and sum for calculations, and sorts data for reporting. There are no signs of data leaks, malicious network activity, or obfuscated code. The functions are straightforward and focused on data reporting.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for performance reporting with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It does not handle sensitive data, perform network operations, or execute untrusted code.",
