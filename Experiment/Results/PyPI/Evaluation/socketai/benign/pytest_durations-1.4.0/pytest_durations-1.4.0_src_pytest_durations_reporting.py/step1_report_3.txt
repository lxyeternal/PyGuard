{
  "purpose": "The code generates and formats performance measurement reports based on timing data collected for different functions or processes.",
  "sources": "Input data from the 'measurements' dictionary containing function names and their timing lists.",
  "sinks": "Data is processed internally; no external sinks are evident such as network transmission or file writing.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'measurements' input to report row creation, sorting, and summary calculations, all within local scope.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual control flows are present. No obfuscated or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python libraries for data handling, statistics, and formatting. It performs data filtering, sorting, and aggregation to generate report rows. No external network or system modification functions are used. No dynamic evaluation or obfuscated code detected. The only data handling is local, with no suspicious data leakage or manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate report generation utility for performance metrics, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues. It processes input data securely within memory without external interactions.",
