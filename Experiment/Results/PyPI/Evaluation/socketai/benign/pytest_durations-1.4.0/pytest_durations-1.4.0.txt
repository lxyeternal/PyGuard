The only minor potential security concern is the handling of user-specified log file paths, which is typical in CLI tools and not inherently malicious.

The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; minor security risk scores of 0.1 can be conservatively justified but are slightly overestimated given the code's nature. Overall, the code poses no security threat."
