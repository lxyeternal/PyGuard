{
  "purpose": "The code adds command-line options and configuration logic for a pytest plugin related to measuring and logging test durations.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from command-line options provided by the user via 'parser.getgroup' and 'config.getoption'. It also imports modules based on plugin availability.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is passed to critical sinks such as network, file writing, or system commands. File paths and options are handled as strings, but used only for configuration.",
  "flows": "Input from command-line options flows into configuration and plugin registration logic, primarily for configuring test duration logging. No dangerous data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code uses conditional imports and plugin registration typical of pytest extensions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines default parameters and functions to add command-line options for a pytest plugin related to measuring test durations. It conditionally imports modules based on plugin presence and dynamically creates plugin classes. No suspicious or malicious behavior is observed. The code appears to be a standard pytest plugin setup script, with no evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign pytest plugin configuration script that adds options for duration logging. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
