{
  "purpose": "Provides pytest plugin options for measuring and logging test durations and results.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard typing, pytest, and pytest plugin modules; reads configuration options.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sinks such as network, file writing (beyond user-specified filename), or environment variables.",
  "flows": "Configuration options are read from user input, and the plugin is registered based on these options.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated segments. Dynamic class creation is used but appears to serve legitimate plugin extension purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up command-line options for pytest and registers a plugin based on user input. It conditionally imports modules and dynamically creates a subclass for plugin extension if certain plugins are detected. There are no indications of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious data exfiltration mechanisms. The code follows standard patterns for pytest plugin configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pytest plugin configuration script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It dynamically modifies plugin classes based on detected plugins, which is a typical extension pattern. Overall, it appears safe.",
