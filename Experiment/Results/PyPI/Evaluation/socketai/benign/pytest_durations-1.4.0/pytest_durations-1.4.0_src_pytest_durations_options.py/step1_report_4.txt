  "purpose": "Define and register pytest plugin options and configuration for tracking test durations and logging.",
  "sources": "Reading of function parameters, import statements, default configuration constants, plugin registration, and option parsing.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data handling or external data output present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to functions, configuration options to plugin registration, and import statements to runtime plugin registration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or anomalies; standard use of pytest plugin pattern, dynamic class creation appears benign.",
  "analysis": "The code defines default configuration constants, adds command-line options for a pytest plugin, and registers the plugin during configuration. Imports are conditional and limited to type checking or runtime plugin registration. The dynamic creation of the plugin class with inheritance from an optional xdist mixin is a common pattern to extend plugin functionality conditionally. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code segments. No external data is read from untrusted sources, nor are there any sinks that would transmit data externally. Overall, the code performs standard plugin setup routines without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign pytest plugin setup script that adds options and conditionally registers plugin classes. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
