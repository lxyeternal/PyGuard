  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as utility functions for pytest fixtures and test items.\n- They emphasize that the code only reads attributes, performs string manipulations, and uses type hints with conditional imports.\n- No external data is transmitted, no untrusted inputs are processed in a risky way, and there are no signs of malicious behavior.\n- The code appears straightforward, safe, and aligned with standard pytest practices.\n\n**Scores and Justification:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.1, indicating no significant security risk. Given the code's simplicity and lack of external interactions, this is justified.\n\n**Potential Issues or Discrepancies:**\n- No report suggests any suspicious behavior or vulnerabilities.\n- The use of `TYPE_CHECKING` is standard and does not introduce security concerns.\n- String parsing is safe and simple.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard utility module for pytest, with no malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's characteristics.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (since it’s very low, mainly because it’s utility code with no security issues)\n\n**Final notes:**\n- No changes needed to the reported scores.\n- The code is safe, with no security risks or malware concerns.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
