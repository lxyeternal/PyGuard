  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling pytest fixtures and test item identifiers.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'nodeid' attribute from 'Item' objects and the 'argname' attribute from 'FixtureDef' objects.",
  "sinks": "The functions process input data but do not pass untrusted data to potentially dangerous sinks such as network, file system, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Input (FixtureDef and Item objects) -> processing in functions -> returned string identifiers or boolean values.",
  "anomalies": "Use of string manipulation for extracting test names and fixture names; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple utility functions for pytest test framework integration, extracting fixture names and test identifiers, and checking fixture scope. All data handling involves string parsing and comparisons, with no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or dangerous behavior. It does not process untrusted external inputs in a way that could lead to injection or data leaks. The use of type annotations within 'if TYPE_CHECKING' blocks is standard practice for type hinting without runtime overhead.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as utility helpers for pytest tests, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears safe and straightforward.",
