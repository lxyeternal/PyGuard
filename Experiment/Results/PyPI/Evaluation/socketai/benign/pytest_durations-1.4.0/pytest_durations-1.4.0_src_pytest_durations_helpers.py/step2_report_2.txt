  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Defines three utility functions for pytest fixtures and test items.\n- Uses `TYPE_CHECKING` to import types only during type checking.\n- Functions:\n  - `_get_fixture_key`: returns `fixturedef.argname`.\n  - `_get_test_key`: extracts test name from `item.nodeid`, removing filename and parameters.\n  - `_is_shared_fixture`: returns whether the fixture scope is not \"function\".\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code matches the description: no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- No evidence of data leaks, external communications, or malicious code.\n- String manipulations are straightforward.\n- No dynamic code execution or obfuscation.\n- Use of `TYPE_CHECKING` is standard for type hints.\n\n### Logical errors or flaws:\n- The code appears correct, with proper exception handling in `_get_test_key`.\n- No issues in the logic or implementation.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign malware score = 0, security risk = 0, obfuscated = 0.\n- The reasoning aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 1 or 0.9), which is appropriate.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since there's no malicious activity, the risk scores should remain at 0.\n- Malware score is correctly 0, as no malicious behavior is present.\n- Obfuscated score is 0, as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- Security risk is 0, given the lack of external data handling or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Potential discrepancies:\n- No discrepancies are evident; the assessments are consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nBased on the detailed review, I agree with the given scores. The code is standard utility functions with no security concerns.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the scores reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, well-structured, and serves a typical purpose in pytest test suites. No modifications to the scores are necessary.",
