  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling pytest fixture and test item metadata",
  "sources": "Type hints importing from pytest fixtures and nodes, access to item.nodeid and fixturedef.argname",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data leaks or external communications",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to internal string processing and property access",
  "anomalies": "Use of TYPE_CHECKING for type hints, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code defines helper functions for extracting fixture names, test item identifiers, and scope information from pytest objects. It uses type hints that are only imported during type checking, avoiding runtime dependencies. String manipulation is straightforward, without any external data interaction or security-sensitive operations. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code is simple, clean, and aligns with standard pytest practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for pytest, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured, with no anomalies or malicious indicators.",
