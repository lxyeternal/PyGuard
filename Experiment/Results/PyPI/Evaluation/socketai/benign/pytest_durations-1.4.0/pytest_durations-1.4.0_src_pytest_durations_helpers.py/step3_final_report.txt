  "purpose": "Utility functions for pytest fixtures and test items: retrieving fixture names, extracting test identifiers, and determining fixture scope.",
  "sources": "Reads attributes from FixtureDef and Item objects, performs string splitting on item.nodeid.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows; purely local attribute access and string operations.",
  "flows": "Input data from FixtureDef.argname and Item.nodeid flows through string splitting and attribute access without external transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward attribute access and string parsing, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three utility functions with simple logic: returning fixture names, parsing test identifiers, and checking fixture scope. It uses type hints conditioned on TYPE_CHECKING, avoiding runtime dependencies. String manipulations are safe, exception handling in _get_test_key is appropriate. No external data, network, or file operations are involved. The code aligns with standard pytest utility patterns and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and safe. It performs utility functions without security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
