  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for handling pytest fixture and test item metadata, such as retrieving fixture names and test identifiers.",
  "sources": "Reads only from function parameters and local variables; no external or untrusted input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or operations that process untrusted data or write to external systems.",
  "flows": "N/A - No flow from untrusted sources to sinks; functions operate on passed-in objects with no external data influence.",
  "anomalies": "Use of conditional import for type hints, which is standard practice; no obfuscated or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three utility functions that extract information from pytest fixture and test item objects. It employs type hints with conditional import for type checking, which is common in Python codebases to avoid runtime dependencies. The functions perform string manipulations and attribute access to obtain fixture names and test identifiers, with proper exception handling. No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious operations are present. The code appears straightforward and intended for code clarity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves as utility functions for pytest metadata handling. No malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks are identified.",
