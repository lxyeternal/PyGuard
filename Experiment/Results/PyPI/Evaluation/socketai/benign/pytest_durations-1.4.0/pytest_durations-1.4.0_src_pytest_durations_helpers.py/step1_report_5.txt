{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for handling pytest fixtures and test items, such as retrieving fixture names, test item names, and determining if a fixture is shared.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'nodeid' attribute from 'Item' objects and the 'argname' attribute from 'FixtureDef' objects.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that handle untrusted data or data that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks that could lead to security issues.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses TYPE_CHECKING imports to avoid runtime dependencies, which is a common pattern for type hints. No suspicious or unusual code behavior is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides helper functions for test fixture and test item identification, with straightforward string parsing and attribute access. No data from external sources is processed insecurely, and no data is written or transmitted. The functions are read-only and do not execute any untrusted input or perform risky operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, mainly serving as a utility for test framework management. It contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. The use of type hints and simple string manipulations is standard practice.",
