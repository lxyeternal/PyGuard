  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as primarily import/setup and metadata definition.\n- No reports identify any malicious code, dynamic behaviors, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n- The code is standard for a Python package's initialization or core module setup.\n- The metadata variables are static package attributes, not dynamically derived or obfuscated.\n- No data flows from untrusted sources, no network or file operations, and no user input handling.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code is straightforward, importing modules and defining `__all__`. No issues or anomalies are present.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected. The code does not perform any data transmission, dynamic execution, or obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code or constructs are present.\n- **Security risks:** The code appears safe, with minimal risk (mostly standard package setup).\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n- The **metadata variables** imported from `package_info` are standard package attributes, not suspicious.\n- The **alias** `mpu = parallel_state` is benign.\n- The **import statements** are straightforward and do not involve dynamic code or untrusted sources.\n- The **`__all__`** list correctly exposes the intended symbols.\n\n### Scores review:\n- The **malware score** is consistently 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- The **obfuscated score** is 0, which is correct.\n- The **risk score** is very low (~0.1), reflecting minimal concern, which seems reasonable given the analysis.\n\n### Any inconsistencies or unreasonable scores?\n- The scores are consistent with the code content and analysis.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, standard package setup)\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\nGiven the detailed review, I agree with the provided scores. The code is standard package setup code with no malicious intent or security issues.\n\n**Final scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis code appears safe, with no security concerns.",
