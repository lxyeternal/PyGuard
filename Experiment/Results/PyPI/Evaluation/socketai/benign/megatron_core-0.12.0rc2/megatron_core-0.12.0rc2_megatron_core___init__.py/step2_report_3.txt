  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is primarily import statements and metadata definitions. No data flows, obfuscation, or malicious activity are detected.  \n- **Scores:** Malware (0), Obfuscated (0), Risk (0.1) seem reasonable given the benign nature. The slightly elevated risk score accounts for the package metadata, which is standard but could be misused if manipulated.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it recognizes the code as straightforward package setup. No suspicious behavior or data flows.  \n- **Scores:** Malware (0), Obfuscated (0), Risk (0) are appropriate. The confidence is high (1).  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is just imports and metadata, with no signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware (0), Obfuscated (0), Risk (0) fit well.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion—standard import and setup code, no malicious logic.  \n- **Scores:** Malware (0), Obfuscated (0), Risk (0.1) are suitable.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports, no malicious or suspicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware (0), Obfuscated (0), Risk (0) are appropriate.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity, and the code is purely import/setup code.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected in any report; all are straightforward imports and metadata.  \n- **Risk Score:** Slightly elevated in some reports (0.1) due to package metadata, but these are standard and not inherently risky unless manipulated.  \n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is standard package initialization code, with no dynamic execution, no user input handling, no network activity, and no obfuscation.  \n- The package metadata variables are static and typical for Python packages, not suspicious.  \n- No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks.  \n\n### My Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to account for package metadata, but overall very low risk)  \n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, clean, and standard for a Python package's setup. No security concerns are present.",
