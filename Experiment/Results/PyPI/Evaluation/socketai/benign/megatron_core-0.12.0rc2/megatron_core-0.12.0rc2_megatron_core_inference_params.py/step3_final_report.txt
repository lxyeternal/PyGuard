{
  "purpose": "This code imports a context class for inference from a local module, likely as part of a larger AI or inference framework.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from a relative module '.inference.contexts'. No external data sources or inputs are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to leaks or effects, as the code only performs a static import.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the import is static and does not process untrusted input or produce output.",
  "anomalies": "The only anomaly is the future copyright year '2025', which appears to be a placeholder or typo but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement with no execution, data handling, or network activity. It is standard practice in Python packages. The only unusual aspect is the future date, which does not impact security. No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious intent is detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright date, which does not pose a security concern. The assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
