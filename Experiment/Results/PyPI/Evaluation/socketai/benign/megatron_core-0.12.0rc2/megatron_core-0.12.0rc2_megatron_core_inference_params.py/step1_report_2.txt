{
  "purpose": "The code appears to import a class 'StaticInferenceContext' from a module within a package, likely for use in inference or context management related to machine learning or similar tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current module for importing statements.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks, such as data output, network connections, or file writes, within this snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks in this isolated code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The only notable anomaly is the copyright year '2025' which is in the future, but this is not inherently malicious. The import itself is standard and unremarkable.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, performing only a single import of a class with some comments to suppress warnings about unused imports. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. The copyright date is in the future, possibly indicating a typo or placeholder, but this does not affect security.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import statement with no malicious behavior or security issues detected. It appears to be part of a larger project, with no suspicious activity in this fragment.",
