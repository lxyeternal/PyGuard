{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be importing a class named StaticInferenceContext from a module related to inference contexts, likely for use in a machine learning or inference pipeline.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing StaticInferenceContext from a relative module path",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks or data flows that handle untrusted input or could lead to data leaks",
  "flows": "No data flow paths from untrusted sources to sinks observed",
  "anomalies": "The only notable anomaly is the copyright date set to 2025, which is in the future, suggesting a possible placeholder or incorrect date. No other unusual or suspicious code behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement with no execution logic or data processing. It imports a class that likely defines a context for inference processes. The code contains a future copyright date, which could be an oversight but does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscated elements are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign import statement with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The future copyright date may be a placeholder or typo but does not impact security.",
