{
  "purpose": "The code imports a class 'StaticInferenceContext' as 'InferenceParams' from a module within the package, likely for inference-related configuration or context management.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module within the package: .inference.contexts",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no data handling, network communication, or sensitive operations observed",
  "flows": "Import flows from the module to the local namespace; no data flows or untrusted data handling present",
  "anomalies": "The comment indicates the import is unused, which may suggest dead code or incomplete implementation; no other anomalies present",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of a single import statement with a comment about unused import. The import is from a relative module, which is standard in package development. The comment indicates the linter suppression for unused imports. No input/output, data handling, or suspicious activity is evident. The copyright line states 2025, which is future-dated, but this does not impact security analysis directly.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple, benign import statement intended for internal use within a package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
