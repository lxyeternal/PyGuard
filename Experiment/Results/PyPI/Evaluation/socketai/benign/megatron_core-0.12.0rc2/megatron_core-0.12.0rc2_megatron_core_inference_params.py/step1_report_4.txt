{
  "purpose": "This code imports a class called StaticInferenceContext as InferenceParams from a module within the inference.contexts package, likely for use in inference-related processes.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .inference.contexts import StaticInferenceContext",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or data sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; only static import, no runtime data flow",
  "anomalies": "The only anomaly is a copyright date set to 2025, which is in the future and unusual but not malicious; no suspicious code behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code contains a single import statement with comments to disable linter warnings. The import is from a relative module, indicating it is part of a larger package. The presence of a future copyright date is unusual but not malicious. No code execution, data processing, or suspicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with no signs of malicious behavior. It appears to be a straightforward part of a larger codebase.",
