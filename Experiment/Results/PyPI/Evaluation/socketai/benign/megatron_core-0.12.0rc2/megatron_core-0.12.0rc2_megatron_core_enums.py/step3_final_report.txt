{
  "purpose": "Defines enumeration types for model configurations and FP8 quantization strategies within a machine learning framework.",
  "sources": "No external inputs; static enum class definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow to untrusted sources or external systems.",
  "flows": "N/A; static definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward enum definitions with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the enum module and defines two enum classes: 'ModelType' with integer values and 'Fp8Recipe' with string values. It is static, with no external data, network activity, or dynamic behavior. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, standard, and safe. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are consistent with the code's content and purpose. The code serves as a configuration or categorization snippet within a larger ML system, with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static enumeration definition used for configuration purposes. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments and scores provided are accurate and justified.",
