{
  "purpose": "Defines enumerations for model types and FP8 recipes, likely used for configuring or identifying different model configurations or modes.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading functions present.",
  "sinks": "No output, data leakage, or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks as no such code exists.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to be straightforward enum definitions with no unusual patterns, obfuscation, or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the enum module and defines two Enum classes: ModelType with four model type options, and Fp8Recipe with three FP8 recipe options. There are no external data reads, no user input, no file handling, and no network operations. The purpose seems to be for configuration or categorization within a larger codebase. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident from these definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard and safe enumeration definition for model configurations and recipes. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
