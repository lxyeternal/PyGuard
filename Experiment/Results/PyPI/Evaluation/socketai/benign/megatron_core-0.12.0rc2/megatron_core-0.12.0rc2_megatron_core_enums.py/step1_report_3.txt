{
  "purpose": "Define enumerations for model types and FP8 recipe names, likely used for configuring or categorizing models in a larger application.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes and constants.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only static definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code appears to be standard enum definitions without suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the enum module and defines two enumeration classes: ModelType and Fp8Recipe. These are straightforward, documenting types of models and FP8 quantization strategies. There are no dynamic behaviors, no external data inputs, and no code execution or network interactions. The code is purely static and self-contained, serving as configuration or constants.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, serving as simple enumeration definitions without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
