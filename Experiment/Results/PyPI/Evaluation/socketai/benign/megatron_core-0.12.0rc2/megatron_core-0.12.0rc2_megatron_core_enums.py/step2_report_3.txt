  "review": "Let's review the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code imports the enum module.\n- Defines two enum classes:\n  - `ModelType` with four integer values representing different model configurations.\n  - `Fp8Recipe` with three string values representing FP8 quantization strategies.\n- The code is static, with no external input, data processing, or network activity.\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, benign, and typical for configuration purposes.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard enum definition with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning?**  \n  No. The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`, which is appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`, which aligns with the code's static, configuration-only nature.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- The reports assume that enum definitions are harmless, which is generally true.\n- No claims of vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made, which is consistent with the code.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The code does not contain any obfuscation, dynamic behavior, or external dependencies.\n- No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or malware.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Overall, the code is a benign configuration snippet with no security concerns.**  \nNo changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0  \n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and consensus of the reports.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, safe enumeration definition used for configuration purposes in a machine learning framework. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
