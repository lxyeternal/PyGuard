{
  "purpose": "Defines enumeration classes for model types and FP8 recipes.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading points in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or could cause data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only declares enums.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to be straightforward enum declarations with descriptive comments. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious behavior, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'enum' module and defines two enum classes: ModelType and Fp8Recipe. These classes are simple enumerations used for categorizing model types and FP8 recipe names. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious or malicious operations. The comments are standard documentation strings. The code is well-structured, minimal, and does not perform any actions beyond defining enums.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign enumeration definition with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger, legitimate project. No malware or security concerns identified.",
