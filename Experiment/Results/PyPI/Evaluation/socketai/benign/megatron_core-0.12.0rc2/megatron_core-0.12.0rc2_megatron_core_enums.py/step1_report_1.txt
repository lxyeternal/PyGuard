{
  "purpose": "Define enumerations for model types and FP8 recipes, likely used for configuration or classification in a larger machine learning framework.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; static code with class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; purely static class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists of standard enum class definitions with no suspicious or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the enum module and defines two enum classes: ModelType and Fp8Recipe. Both are straightforward and serve as enumerations for different model configurations and FP8 recipe names. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious logic or behavior. The code appears to be a typical, static configuration module used in machine learning workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for defining enums for configuration purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
