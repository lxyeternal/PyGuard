  "purpose": "Define enumeration classes for model types and FP8 recipes.",
  "sources": "Import of enum module; class definitions with string and integer constants.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; straightforward enum class definitions with documented docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the enum module, then defines two enum classes: ModelType with four integer values, and Fp8Recipe with three string values. Both classes include descriptive docstrings. There are no dynamic code evaluations, external data reads, or network operations. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code. The code appears to be a standard enumeration definition intended for use in larger software components.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign enumeration class definitions for model types and FP8 recipes, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
