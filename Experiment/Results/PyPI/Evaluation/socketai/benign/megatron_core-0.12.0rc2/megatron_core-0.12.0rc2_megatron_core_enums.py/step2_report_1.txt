  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as straightforward enum class definitions.\n- No external inputs, dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing are involved.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious intent are identified.\n- The code is static, minimal, and appears to serve configuration or categorization purposes within a larger ML framework.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code imports the enum module and defines two enums: `ModelType` (with integer values) and `Fp8Recipe` (with string values).\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, standard, and safe.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, indicating high certainty in the benign nature.\n- Malware, obfuscated code, and security risk scores are all 0, which is consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Potential issues or flaws:**\n- There are no issues, errors, or flaws in the code logic or reasoning. The reports correctly identify the code as simple enum definitions.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- The security risk score is 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n- The risk scores are all 0.5 or higher only if there were signs of malicious intent, which there are not.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The high confidence scores are justified.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- Malware score: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- Obfuscated score: 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- Risk score: 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Final note:**\n- No changes are necessary; the reports are accurate and comprehensive.\n- The code is a typical, safe configuration snippet for ML model categorization.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign, standard enum definitions.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.",
