{
  "purpose": "Configure and select JIT compilation functions based on PyTorch version, likely for performance optimization in a larger machine learning project.",
  "sources": "Import statements for torch and a utility function; use of torch.jit.script and torch.compile.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no untrusted data handling or external communication present.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic function assignment based on version check; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary libraries, sets a variable to a JIT function, and conditionally reassigns it based on the PyTorch version. This appears to be a standard performance optimization pattern. No evidence of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. The code is minimal and functional, aligned with typical performance tuning practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, intended for performance optimization using PyTorch JIT features, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
