  "purpose": "Define version information, package metadata, and contact details for the Megatron Core library.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded constants and string literals defining version, contact info, URLs, and description.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or system compromise.",
  "flows": "N/A - No data flow from external sources to sinks; all data are static constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected. The code primarily sets metadata variables.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes versioning variables, metadata strings, and URLs related to the package. All values are hardcoded and static. No dynamic code execution, input reading, or external data processing present. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are identified. It is a standard metadata definition segment for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely declarative metadata for the package with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be standard, benign package information setup.",
