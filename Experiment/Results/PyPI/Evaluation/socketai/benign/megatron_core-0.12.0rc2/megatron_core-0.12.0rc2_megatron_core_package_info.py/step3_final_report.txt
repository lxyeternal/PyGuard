  "purpose": "Static package metadata declarations including version info, contact details, URLs, description, and license for the 'megatron_core' package.",
  "sources": "Constant variable assignments for version, contact info, URLs, description, license, and keywords.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; static data only.",
  "flows": "N/A - static data; no data flow from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and metadata-only.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments defining package metadata. There are no functions, dynamic code, external inputs, or obfuscation. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is typical for package setup files and contains no secrets or sensitive data. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign, static nature of the code. No logical flaws or errors are identified. The code's simplicity and transparency confirm its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign static metadata with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are justified. No further action or concern is necessary.",
