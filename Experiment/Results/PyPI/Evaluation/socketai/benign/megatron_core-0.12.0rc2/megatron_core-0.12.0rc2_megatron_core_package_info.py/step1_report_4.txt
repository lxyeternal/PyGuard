  "purpose": "Define metadata and version information for the Megatron Core library.",
  "sources": "Constants and string assignments, especially environment variables and URLs.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; URLs are static, no user input handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; static data only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns, such as obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of metadata definitions, versioning, contact info, URLs, and descriptive strings. It contains no code that reads input, writes to files, or interacts with external systems dynamically. All URLs and contact info are static and publicly available. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The code appears to be a standard package metadata setup typical for a Python package, with no suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving only to define package metadata and version information for a Python library. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
