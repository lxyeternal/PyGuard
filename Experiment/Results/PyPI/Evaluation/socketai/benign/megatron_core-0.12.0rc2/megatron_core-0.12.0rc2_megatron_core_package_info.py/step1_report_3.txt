  "purpose": "Defines metadata and version information for the Megatron Core library, including version, contact, and repository details.",
  "sources": "Constants and string literals assigned to variables (e.g., version info, contact emails, URLs).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks identified. No external input handling or data output to untrusted locations.",
  "flows": "N/A — No data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard version and metadata definitions. No hardcoded secrets beyond public contact emails, which are normal for package info.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static metadata definitions, including versioning, contact info, URLs, and descriptions. No dynamic code execution, no data processing, and no external input handling. All data appears to be static and intended for package metadata purposes. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. It follows typical package setup conventions.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward metadata declaration for a Python package. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious anomalies, and no security risks. It is safe and standard for open-source package documentation.",
