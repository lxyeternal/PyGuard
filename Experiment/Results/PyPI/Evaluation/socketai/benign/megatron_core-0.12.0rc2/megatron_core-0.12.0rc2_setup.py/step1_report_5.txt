  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, configuring dependencies, metadata, and extensions.",
  "sources": "Reading package info from 'megatron/core/package_info.py', environment variables, reading requirements files, and reading README.md.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data found; no data leaks or insecure data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Package info loaded -> environment variables read -> requirements files read -> setup configuration executed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of importlib to load a local package info module; reading environment variable 'PY_ENV'; concatenating requirements from multiple sources. No suspicious code or hardcoded secrets observed.",
  "analysis": "The script dynamically imports package metadata from a local file, reads environment variables to determine requirements, and constructs setup configuration accordingly. No suspicious or malicious code constructs detected, such as code injection, network activity, or data exfiltration. The code uses standard setup procedures and well-understood build practices. The environment variable 'PY_ENV' could influence dependencies, but this is typical for environment-specific configurations. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, legitimate setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
