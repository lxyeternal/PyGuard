  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python pip package, configuring package metadata, dependencies, and extensions.",
  "sources": "Reads package info from an external Python file ('megatron/core/package_info.py'), environment variables ('PY_ENV'), and requirement files ('requirements.txt' and 'megatron/core/requirements.txt').",
  "sinks": "None directly evident; no untrusted data is being processed into sensitive operations like network connections, file writes, or system commands beyond standard setup.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'PY_ENV' influences requirement file reading; package info is loaded from external module; setup parameters are populated from loaded data. No untrusted input flows into dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of importlib to load package info dynamically from a specific path; environment variable 'PY_ENV' used to select requirements file; no obvious hardcoded credentials or backdoors; setup process appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The script loads package metadata dynamically, reducing hardcoding risks. Environment variable influences requirements but is controlled via typical build environment. The extension module is compiled with standard flags, sourcing C++ code for performance. No suspicious network operations, data leaks, or malicious code patterns detected. The code uses standard setup tools and common practices without obfuscation or hidden behaviors. Overall, the script appears to be a normal package setup configuration without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python package setup script that dynamically loads package metadata and dependencies. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected. It follows standard practices and does not include suspicious or malicious code elements.",
