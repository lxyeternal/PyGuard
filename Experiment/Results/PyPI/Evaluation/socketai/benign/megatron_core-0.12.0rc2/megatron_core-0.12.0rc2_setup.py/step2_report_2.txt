  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the setup script is standard, dynamically loads package info, reads requirements based on environment variables, and compiles a C++ extension via subprocess.\n- No report indicates any malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.\n- The main potential security concern is the subprocess call to retrieve compiler flags: if the external command or environment is compromised, it could execute malicious code, but in a controlled build environment, this is standard practice.\n- Use of environment variables ('PY_ENV') to select requirements files is common but could be exploited if environment variables are manipulated maliciously; however, this is typical in build scripts.\n- Importing package info via importlib from a specific path is unusual but not malicious, assuming the source is trusted.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the analysis indicating no malicious behavior.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- Security risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minor concerns about environment variables and subprocess usage, but nothing alarming.\n- Confidence levels are high (0.9), which seems justified given the consistent analysis.\n\n**Critical Evaluation:**\n- No issues are present in the code that would suggest malware, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n- The use of subprocess to get compiler flags is standard but should be noted as a potential attack vector if the environment is compromised—however, this is outside the scope of the code itself.\n- The reliance on external files and environment variables is typical but warrants caution in untrusted environments.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports' assessments are reasonable and consistent.\n- The overall risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain low.\n- The only potential adjustment could be a slight increase in security risk score if we consider the subprocess call and environment variable reliance as marginally risky, but given the context, the current scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (minor concerns about environment variables and subprocess calls, but standard in build scripts)\n\n**Final note:** The code appears to be a typical, well-structured setup script with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned in the reports are justified and do not require significant changes.",
