  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, dynamically loads package metadata, reads environment-specific requirements, and configures extension compilation.",
  "sources": "Reading package info from a Python file, environment variables for requirements, subprocess call for compiler flags, reading README and requirements files.",
  "sinks": "None of the data flows lead to security-sensitive sinks; subprocess call executes external command for build configuration, but is standard practice.",
  "flows": "Package info import -> environment variable for requirements -> subprocess for compiler flags -> setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of importlib to load package info dynamically, reliance on environment variables, subprocess call for compiler flags, but all are standard in build scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for a Python package, with dynamic metadata loading, environment-dependent requirements, and extension compilation. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The subprocess call for compiler flags is standard in extension building, assuming a trusted environment. The dynamic import of package info is common for single-sourcing version info. No network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are justified given the code's nature and lack of malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is a standard, well-structured package configuration with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low risk scores are appropriate, and the malware and obfuscation scores should remain at 0. The overall security assessment is that this code is safe for use.",
