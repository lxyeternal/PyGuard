{
  "purpose": "The code imports classes from the 'envier.env' module and defines an export list for a package.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'envier.env' module",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs present",
  "flows": "Imports from 'envier.env' are assigned to local names and exported",
  "anomalies": "Incorrect assignment: 'En = Env' should be 'En = Env()' to instantiate the class; as written, it assigns the class itself, not an instance. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'Env' and 'HelpInfo' from the 'envier.env' module. It attempts to assign the class 'Env' to 'En', but without parentheses, it does not instantiate the class. This could be a coding mistake rather than malicious intent. The __all__ list indicates intended exports. No data input/output, network activity, or obfuscated code present. No signs of malicious behavior or malware. The main concern is a potential bug due to missing parentheses for instantiation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, with an apparent mistake in class instantiation rather than malicious behavior. There are no signs of malware or security risks. The main issue is a likely coding error.",
