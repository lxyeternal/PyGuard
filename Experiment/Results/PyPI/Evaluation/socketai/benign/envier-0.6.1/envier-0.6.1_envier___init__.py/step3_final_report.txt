  "purpose": "Module setup with imports and aliasing of classes for export.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'envier.env' and assignment 'En = Env' (reference to class, not instantiation).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, no external communication, no data leaks.",
  "flows": "Import statements and class reference assignment; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Assignment 'En = Env' creates a class reference, possibly a typo or stylistic alias; no instantiation occurs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes 'Env' and 'HelpInfo' from 'envier.env'. It assigns 'En' to the class 'Env' without parentheses, meaning 'En' is a reference, not an instance. This is likely intentional or a minor oversight, not malicious. The code defines '__all__' for module exports. No data flow, external communication, or obfuscation is present. No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected. The assignment does not introduce security risks but may be a stylistic choice or a bug. The overall structure is benign and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or activity. The only minor concern is the alias assignment without instantiation, which is likely a stylistic choice or oversight. No security risks, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present.",
