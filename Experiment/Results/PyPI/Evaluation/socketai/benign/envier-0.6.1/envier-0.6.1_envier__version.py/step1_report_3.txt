  "purpose": "Define version information and types for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuples, conditional import for type checking.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; static assignments only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is a standard version info definition with conditional typing.",
  "analysis": "The code sets version variables for a Python package, with a conditional import for type hints. It assigns static version info to variables and does not process any untrusted input or perform any runtime operations that could be malicious. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or sensitive data handling are present. The structure and content appear typical for package version files generated by setuptools_scm.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version definition file with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
