{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a package generated by setuptools_scm, primarily for version tracking and type checking.",
  "sources": "The version string '__version__' and '__version_tuple__' are assigned directly within the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The version string is assigned to variables directly; no data flow from external sources occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains conditional type checking logic, but no suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets version metadata for a Python package, with a standard pattern for version management using setuptools_scm. It includes a conditional for type checking imports, but does not perform any data validation, external data retrieval, or potentially malicious actions. All assignments are static and explicit. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard version information module with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply defines package version constants for use elsewhere.",
