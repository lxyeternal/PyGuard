  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims based on the provided code.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is a standard, auto-generated version information module.\n- All reports agree that there are no dynamic behaviors, external data flows, or suspicious patterns.\n- The code contains conditional type hinting, which is common and benign.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n\n**1. Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n- The code is straightforward: static assignment of version strings and tuples.\n- No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n- The reports correctly identify the code as boilerplate for version management.\n\n**2. Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n- They correctly note the absence of external data, dynamic code, or suspicious patterns.\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n\n**3. Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n- All reports assign `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, and `obfuscated: 0`.\n- These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**4. Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n- All scores are zero; no justification needed for higher scores.\n- The code is a standard version info module, with no security concerns.\n\n**5. Malware Score Reflection:**\n- All reports assign malware score = 0.\n- This is correct; no malicious activity is present.\n\n**6. Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n- No claims are made about vulnerabilities or malicious intent based on assumptions.\n- The assessments are based on direct code analysis.\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores with Reports:**\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n- No discrepancies observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is static, generated boilerplate for versioning.\n- No external inputs, dynamic code, or suspicious patterns.\n- All assessments are accurate and align with the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe reports are thorough, accurate, and consistent. The code is benign, with no security issues or malicious behavior. The assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the scores at zero across malware, obfuscated, and risk metrics. The code is safe and standard for its purpose.",
