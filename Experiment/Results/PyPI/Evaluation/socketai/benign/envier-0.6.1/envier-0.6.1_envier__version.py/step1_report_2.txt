  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, to facilitate version management and type checking.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuples, and conditional import for type checking.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; no external data input or output occurs.",
  "flows": "The version string and tuple are set directly without external input, establishing internal package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected. The code is straightforward and standard for version handling.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes version information for a package, using a conditional import for type annotations. It assigns fixed version strings and tuples, with no dynamic or external data involved. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities are present. The code appears to be a standard generated file to manage package versioning.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version metadata file with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
