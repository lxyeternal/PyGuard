  "purpose": "This code serves as a static version information module generated by setuptools_scm, providing version details for a Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it assigns static version strings and tuples directly within the script.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leakage or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only assigns static variables without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a conditional import for type checking, which is standard and harmless; no anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static assignment of version information with no dynamic or external data handling. It contains no obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with appropriate zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The code's simplicity and static nature justify these assessments, and no inconsistencies or errors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, boilerplate versioning module with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports are accurate and consistent, and the assigned scores correctly reflect its safe, static nature.",
