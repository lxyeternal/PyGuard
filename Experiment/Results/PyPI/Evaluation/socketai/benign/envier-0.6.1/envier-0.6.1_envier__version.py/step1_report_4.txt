  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, including version strings and tuples, generated by setuptools_scm for version management.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuples within the code, including the version variable and version tuple variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows are present; no external output or data leak points identified.",
  "flows": "Assignment of static version strings and tuples; no dynamic or external data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of type-checking block that conditionally imports typing constructs; no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets version-related variables for a Python package, using static values assigned directly within the script. The type checking block is standard for type annotations and does not introduce external dependencies or dynamic code execution. All assignments are static and straightforward, with no suspicious logic, data manipulation, or external communication. The code appears to be boilerplate generated by setuptools_scm for version management, and contains no indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, static version info definition script generated by a standard tool. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe for use and poses no security threat.",
