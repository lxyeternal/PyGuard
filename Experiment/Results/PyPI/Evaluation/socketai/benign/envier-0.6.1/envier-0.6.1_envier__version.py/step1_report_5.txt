  "purpose": "Define version information and type hints for a Python package generated by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and version tuple variables.",
  "sinks": "None identified; code does not process untrusted input or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code merely assigns static version data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of conditional type hinting and static version assignment is typical for build metadata; no suspicious or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up version-related variables, including a version string and tuple, using static values. It uses a TYPE_CHECKING condition for type hints, which is a common pattern. No input, environment variable, or external data is read or processed. There are no sinks that could leak data or cause harm. The code appears to be boilerplate generated by setuptools_scm for versioning, with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign versioning boilerplate with no malicious behavior or security issues detected.",
