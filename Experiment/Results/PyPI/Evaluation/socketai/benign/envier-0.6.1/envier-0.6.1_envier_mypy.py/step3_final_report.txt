{
  "purpose": "A mypy plugin that customizes type inference for 'envier' classes and attributes during static analysis, modifying type information based on class definitions and method calls.",
  "sources": "AST nodes representing class definitions, assignment statements, method calls, and type annotations within static analysis context.",
  "sinks": "None; the code operates solely during static analysis without external data handling or runtime effects.",
  "flows": "Type information flows from class and method definitions to the inferred types assigned to variables and class attributes during static analysis.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code; straightforward static analysis logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static analysis plugin that hooks into class and method definitions to adjust type inference for specific 'envier' classes. It processes AST nodes to assign types and rename class attributes based on class names and expressions. There are no network operations, data leaks, code execution, or dynamic behaviors. The code's purpose is purely to enhance type safety during static analysis, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign mypy plugin designed for static type inference enhancement. It does not perform any malicious activities, data leaks, or system modifications. All reports correctly identify its static, non-executing nature. The malware score is 0, security risk is 0, obfuscation is 0, and confidence is high.",
