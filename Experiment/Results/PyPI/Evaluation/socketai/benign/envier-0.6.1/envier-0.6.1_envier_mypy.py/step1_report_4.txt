{
  "purpose": "The code implements a plugin for the mypy static type checker, specifically handling custom type inference and class attribute inference for 'envier' classes and methods.",
  "sources": "Reads class definitions, assignment statements, and method calls within the mypy plugin context.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; the code does not perform data output or network operations, nor does it execute untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Processes class and assignment statements to modify type annotations based on specific conditions; no external data flow or untrusted input handling detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs observed. The code primarily manipulates type information within static analysis context.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a mypy plugin to infer types for 'envier' classes and methods, modifying class attributes and method return types during static analysis. It includes callback functions that analyze class bodies and assignments, adjusting type annotations accordingly. The plugin relies on standard mypy plugin architecture, and no dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted data handling is present. The logic appears consistent with type inference goals, and no suspicious patterns or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign mypy plugin aimed at enhancing static type inference for custom 'envier' classes. It contains no malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. The logic is consistent with standard type inference techniques and plugin development. Overall, the code appears safe and purposeful, with no indicators of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
