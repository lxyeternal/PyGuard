{
  "purpose": "The code defines a mypy plugin for handling custom 'envier' attributes and classes, customizing type inference and class attribute handling during static type checking.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include method arguments, class definitions, and assignment statements within the mypy AST during type analysis.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are type assignments and modifications of class or variable annotations, which could influence type inference but do not directly lead to security risks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input AST nodes (AssignmentStmt, ClassDef, MethodContext) through type inference functions to modify class attribute types or method return types.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The code performs static analysis and type inference modifications only.",
  "analysis": "The plugin customizes how mypy interprets 'envier' related classes and attributes, particularly by modifying class attribute types and method return types based on runtime data. The code only interacts with static AST structures and type information, with no external network activity or system manipulation. The logic is focused on type inference enhancement without including malicious or suspicious behavior. No obfuscation, data leaks, or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign mypy plugin designed for type inference customization for 'envier' classes and attributes. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks, focusing solely on static analysis enhancements.",
