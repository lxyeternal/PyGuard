{
  "purpose": "Define validation functions for checking if a value is within specified choices or range.",
  "sources": "The code reads input values through the 'value' parameter in the validate functions.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the validate functions could be used with untrusted input, but they only raise exceptions; no data leaks or harmful actions are present.",
  "flows": "Input values are passed to the validate functions, which then perform checks and may raise exceptions if validation fails.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two higher-order functions that generate validator functions: one for checking if a value is among choices, and another for checking if a value is within a specified range. Both functions perform simple validation logic, raising exceptions if inputs are invalid. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated patterns, or data leakage mechanisms. No external inputs or outputs are involved besides the validation checks. The functions are safe and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, implements standard validation logic, and poses no security threat. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain risks.",
