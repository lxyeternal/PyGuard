{
  "purpose": "The code provides validation functions for checking if a value is within specified choices or range.",
  "sources": "The functions read input values via the 'value' parameter in the inner 'validate' functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks for untrusted data leading to data leaks or system effects; only validation raises exceptions.",
  "flows": "Input 'value' flows through the 'validate' functions, which raise exceptions if conditions are not met.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code constructs are present. The code is straightforward and typical for validators.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two validator factory functions, 'choice' and 'range', which create validation functions that raise ValueError if the input does not meet specified conditions. There are no external data sources, no network activity, or suspicious behavior. The code's purpose is to validate data constraints, and it operates solely with local variables and exception raising. No malicious or suspicious code patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign implementation of validation functions with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
