{
  "purpose": "This code provides a framework for managing environment variables, allowing for type casting, validation, deprecation warnings, and nested configuration classes.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables via the source.get method, potentially from os.environ or a provided dictionary.",
  "sinks": "No unsafe sinks; data flows into class attributes after parsing and validation.",
  "flows": "Source (environment variables) -> _retrieve method -> parsing/casting -> attribute assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected. Usage of warnings for deprecation is standard. No dynamic code execution or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured environment configuration management system. It reads environment variables, supports type casting, validation, deprecation warnings, nested classes, and derived variables. The parsing logic handles common data types safely. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or external network activity are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk scores) are consistent with the code's behavior and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign environment variable management library with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are justified. The reports accurately reflect the benign nature of the code.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
