{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to monitor directory changes during test execution, ensuring the current working directory remains consistent, and fails the test immediately if a change is detected.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current working directory via os.getcwd(), environment variable 'PWD', and test functions that invoke os.chdir() to change directories.",
  "sinks": "The code uses assertions to verify the working directory remains unchanged; failure triggers an AssertionError, which is not a security sink but indicates test failure.",
  "flows": "The getpwd() function sources directory info from os.getcwd() and environment, and this data is used in assertions in beforeTest and afterTest to ensure directory consistency.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; no malicious code or backdoors present. Use of os.chdir('/dev') is unusual but not malicious; it's part of test behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily implements a directory consistency check during testing, ensuring no external process or test alters the working directory unexpectedly. It imports standard libraries, uses assertions for validation, and has no code that performs data exfiltration, network communication, or system modification. No malicious behaviors are evident. The only unusual aspect is changing directory to '/dev' during testing, which is a typical test scenario but could be considered suspicious if misused. Overall, the code is benign and focused on test validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test utility to verify working directory stability during test runs. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security threats. The only notable point is the directory change to '/dev' in a test, which is typical for testing failure conditions, not malicious intent.",
