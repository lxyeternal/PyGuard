  "purpose": "Searches for an executable in system PATH and optionally runs it with provided arguments, displaying output.",
  "sources": "User input via sys.argv; system PATH environment variable",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run() executing commands; output printed to stdout",
  "flows": "User input -> command lookup -> execution via subprocess (if found) -> output display",
  "anomalies": "No input validation or sanitization; executes arbitrary commands based on user input; no obfuscation or malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code searches for an executable matching user-supplied command name in system PATH, considering common extensions. If found, it executes the command with optional arguments, capturing and printing output. It does not validate or sanitize user input, which poses security risks. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads are present. The main risk stems from executing arbitrary commands supplied by the user, which could be exploited if used in untrusted environments. The malware score should be 0, as no malicious code exists. The security risk score is high (~0.75), reflecting the potential for misuse. The code's straightforward nature and lack of malicious features justify these scores.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a simple command launcher with inherent security risks due to executing untrusted user input, but it contains no malicious code or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate, with malware score at 0 and high security risk due to potential misuse.",
