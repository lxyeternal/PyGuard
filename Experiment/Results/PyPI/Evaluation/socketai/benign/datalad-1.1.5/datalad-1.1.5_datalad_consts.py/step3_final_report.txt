{
  "purpose": "This code defines constants, paths, UUIDs, URLs, regex patterns, and OS-specific filename restrictions for the datalad project. It serves as a static configuration module.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'DATALAD_DATASETS_TOPURL', hardcoded UUIDs, imported 'GIT_SSH_COMMAND', and local module 'datalad.runner.gitrunner'.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration with no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and static. The environment variable usage is standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static configuration module that sets constants, paths, UUIDs, URLs, regex patterns, and filename restrictions. It imports a trusted variable, uses environment variables with defaults, and documents UUIDs as pre-generated. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted data processing is present. The code is well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration module with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports—malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 (or 0.1 for cautiousness)—are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
