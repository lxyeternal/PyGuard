{
  "purpose": "This code intentionally raises an ImportError with a custom message to simulate a failed import scenario, likely for testing or mocking purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it is a static statement raising an exception.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code unconditionally raises an exception immediately.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with no obfuscation, hidden behaviors, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, explicit statement raising an ImportError with a message indicating a testing scenario. It contains no external data sources, no network activity, and no obfuscated or malicious code. The purpose appears solely to simulate an import failure for testing error handling. The absence of any suspicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious intent is clear. The code's simplicity and explicit message support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign testing stub designed to simulate an import failure. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The high confidence scores assigned in the reports are justified, and the malware, obfuscation, and risk scores should all be set to 0, with a very low overall security risk.",
