  "purpose": "Raise an ImportError with a specific message, likely for testing purposes.",

  "flows": "The code directly raises an exception when executed; no data flow from source to sink exists.",
  "anomalies": "The message indicates it is intentionally ruining the Scrapy import for testing; no malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single line that raises an ImportError with a custom message. It does not perform any data input, network activity, or system manipulation. The message suggests it is used for testing purposes to simulate an import failure. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious activity.",
