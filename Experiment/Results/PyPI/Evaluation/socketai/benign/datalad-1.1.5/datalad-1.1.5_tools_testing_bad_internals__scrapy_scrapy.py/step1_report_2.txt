{
  "purpose": "The code raises an ImportError with a specific message, likely to simulate or test import failure scenarios.",
  "sources": "The source is the explicit raise statement, which generates an exception when executed.",
  "sinks": "The exception is raised directly, but there are no untrusted data inputs or external data sources involved.",
  "flows": "There is no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only raises an exception unconditionally.",
  "anomalies": "The message 'Scrapy import is ruined for testing' suggests intentional sabotage or testing environment manipulation; no actual import occurs.",
  "analysis": "The code does not perform any malicious activity; it simply raises an ImportError with a custom message. The message indicates this might be a placeholder or a way to simulate import failure during testing. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "This code is not malicious; it appears to be a testing stub or placeholder meant to simulate an import error. There are no security risks or malware present.",
