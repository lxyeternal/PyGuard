  "purpose": "Monitor system interrupts by reading /proc/interrupts periodically, compute differences, and report the most active ones.",
  "sources": "Reads /proc/interrupts file in an infinite loop, parsing lines with regex.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to stdout; no untrusted data sinks or external communication.",
  "flows": "Reads /proc/interrupts -> parses lines -> computes differences -> outputs top active interrupts.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward system monitoring utility that reads /proc/interrupts, calculates the delta of interrupt counts over time, and reports the most active interrupts. It uses standard Python libraries and numpy for numerical calculations. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. The infinite loop with sleep is typical for such monitoring scripts. No obfuscation or backdoors are evident. Potential minor issues include lack of error handling for file access, but this does not indicate malicious intent. The code's behavior is benign, and the scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate system monitoring script with no malicious or obfuscating features. The malware score is correctly 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score should be very low (~0.1) due to its benign nature and typical monitoring behavior.",
