{
  "purpose": "The script monitors system interrupt counts by reading '/proc/interrupts' periodically and reports the most active interrupt sources based on their change over time.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the file '/proc/interrupts' in a continuous loop.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to standard output (console) via print statements.",
  "flows": "Reads interrupt data -> calculates differences between readings -> identifies most active interrupts -> prints report to console.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior. The code uses standard Python libraries and accesses system files legitimately. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution is present. The script runs an infinite loop with sleep, which is typical for monitoring scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and uses a regular expression to parse system interrupt data from '/proc/interrupts'. It maintains previous counts to compute deltas, identifying the most active interrupts. The script operates in a perpetual loop, periodically updating the data. All operations are consistent with system monitoring functions, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. It does not perform any suspicious or unsafe actions beyond normal system monitoring. There are no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no external network interactions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate system monitoring script that reads and reports interrupt activity without any malicious behavior. It does not contain malware, malicious backdoors, or security risks. It is a typical monitoring utility with no security concerns identified.",
