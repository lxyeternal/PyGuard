{
  "purpose": "The code monitors CPU interrupt counts by reading /proc/interrupts and reports the most active interrupts over time.",
  "sources": "Reads from the file /proc/interrupts, which provides system interrupt data.",
  "sinks": "Outputs formatted data to standard output (print statements), displaying system activity information.",
  "flows": "Reads system data from /proc/interrupts (source), computes differences, sorts, and displays most active interrupts (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. The code runs in an infinite loop, but this is typical for monitoring scripts. Uses standard libraries only.",
  "analysis": "The script uses regex to parse /proc/interrupts, which contains system-level data. It reads and processes the data to identify active hardware interrupts. No untrusted input handling beyond reading system info, and no external network or file operations are performed. The code structure is straightforward, with clear separation of reading, processing, and output. No obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate system monitoring tool for tracking CPU interrupt activity. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior and poses no significant security risks. Its purpose is purely informational and local.",
