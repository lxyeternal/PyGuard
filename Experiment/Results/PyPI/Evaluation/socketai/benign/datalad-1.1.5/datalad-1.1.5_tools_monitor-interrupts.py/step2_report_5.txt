  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code and considering the scoring rationale.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the script reads /proc/interrupts periodically, parses data, and reports on the most active interrupts.\n- The code is a straightforward system monitoring utility, with no evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n- The code uses standard Python libraries, regex parsing, and numpy for calculations.\n- Infinite loop with sleep is typical for such monitoring scripts.\n- No external network activity, credentials, or backdoors are present.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious code, or malicious payloads are detected.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code. All reports correctly identify the script as a benign system monitoring tool.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in reasoning:\n\n- **Minor note:** All reports assign a high confidence level (0.9 or 1), which seems appropriate given the straightforward nature of the script.\n- **No significant errors** are evident in the reasoning or summaries.\n\n### Scores review:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified. No malware activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Security risk score:** Very low (0.1 to 0.2), which is reasonable given the code's purpose and behavior.\n\n### Justification for higher scores:\n\n- Since the code is purely a monitoring utility with no malicious intent, scores of 0 for malware and obfuscated are appropriate.\n- The security risk score could be slightly higher if considering the infinite loop, but in the context of a local system monitoring script, this is acceptable and not risky.\n\n### Consistency and potential adjustments:\n\n- The reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n- No adjustments needed; the scoring aligns well with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code, no obfuscation)  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal risk, typical for monitoring scripts)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe code is a legitimate, transparent system monitoring script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware and obfuscated scores at 0.  \n- Slightly increase security risk score to 0.2 if considering the infinite loop, but 0.1 remains acceptable.",
