  "purpose": "Monitor and report changes in system interrupt counts over time by reading /proc/interrupts.",
  "sources": "Reads data from /proc/interrupts file within a while loop.",
  "sinks": "Outputs report to stdout via print statements.",
  "flows": "Reads data from /proc/interrupts (source), computes differences, and prints summaries (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; uses standard system file for monitoring; no external network activity.",
  "analysis": "The script continuously reads /proc/interrupts, parses interrupt counts per CPU, compares with previous data, and reports the most active interrupt lines based on differences. The code employs regular expressions and numpy for data processing, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs. It functions as a monitoring tool for system interrupts, with no evident malicious behavior or malware indicators. The code operates solely within the system's process space, with no external communication or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a system monitoring script that reads and reports system interrupt activity. It shows no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. Its purpose is diagnostic and informational. No security threats or malicious behavior are detected.",
