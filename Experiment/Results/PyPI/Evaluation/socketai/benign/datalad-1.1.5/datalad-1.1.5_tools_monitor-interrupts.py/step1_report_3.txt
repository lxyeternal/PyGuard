  "purpose": "Monitor and report on CPU interrupt activity by reading '/proc/interrupts' periodically.",
  "sources": "Reads data from '/proc/interrupts' file in a continuous loop.",
  "sinks": "Prints output to standard output (console), displaying processed interrupt data.",
  "flows": "Reads and parses '/proc/interrupts' data -> computes differences from previous read -> formats and prints report.",
  "anomalies": "Uses an infinite loop without exit conditions; no cleanup or error handling for file access failures. No evidence of data exfiltration, command execution, or network activity. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script opens and reads '/proc/interrupts' periodically to track changes in interrupt counts across CPUs. It processes data with regex, converts counts to integers, compares with previous snapshot, and displays top interrupt sources based on activity. The code appears to perform standard system monitoring without any malicious logic. There is no obfuscated code, suspicious network activity, or malicious system modifications. It runs locally, collecting system data, and outputs it in a formatted manner. No signs of backdoors, data theft, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a system monitoring tool for interrupt activity. It does not contain malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks based on its content and behavior. It appears safe and legitimate.",
