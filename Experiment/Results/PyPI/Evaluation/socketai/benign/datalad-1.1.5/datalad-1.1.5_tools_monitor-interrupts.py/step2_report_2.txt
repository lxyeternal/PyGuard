  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe a script that reads /proc/interrupts periodically, parses data, and reports active interrupts.\n- The code uses standard Python libraries, regex, numpy, and no external or suspicious modules.\n- The scripts run in infinite loops with sleep, typical for monitoring tools.\n- No signs of data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious payloads are identified.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors are reported or evident.\n- The purpose is system monitoring, with outputs only to stdout.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code's core functionality is straightforward and legitimate.\n- No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected.\n- The infinite loop could be considered a potential issue if uncontrolled, but this is typical for monitoring scripts.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- No coding errors or security flaws are evident.\n- The code does not handle potential file access errors (e.g., if /proc/interrupts is inaccessible), but this does not constitute maliciousness.\n- No cleanup or exit condition is implemented, which might be a design consideration but not a security flaw.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Purpose:** Well-defined, non-malicious.\n- **Sources:** Reads system files legitimately.\n- **Sinks:** Outputs to stdout only.\n- **Flows:** Straightforward data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** None suspicious.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Consistent with a benign system utility.\n- **Confidence:** High (0.9 or 1).\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Malware:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** Very low (~0.1-0.2).\n\n### Justification for scores:\n- The malware score of 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity is present.\n- Obfuscated score is 0; code is clear.\n- Security risk is low, given the benign nature of the script.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n- **Potential issues**: The only concern might be the infinite loop without exit or error handling, but this is typical for such scripts.\n- **Malware or obfuscation**: None detected.\n- **Risk score**: Should remain very low, around 0.1–0.2, as the reports suggest.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments needed; all reports correctly identify the benign nature.\n- The overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at **0**, **0**, and **0.1–0.2** respectively.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2\n\nThe code is a standard, legitimate system monitoring utility with no malicious or security-threatening behavior.",
