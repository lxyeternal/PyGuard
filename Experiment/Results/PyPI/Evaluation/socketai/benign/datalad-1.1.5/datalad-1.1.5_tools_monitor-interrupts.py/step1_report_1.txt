{
  "purpose": "Monitor and report the most active system interrupts over time by reading and analyzing data from /proc/interrupts.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the file /proc/interrupts in an infinite loop.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks that lead to data leaks or external communication; only outputs to stdout.",
  "flows": "Reads /proc/interrupts -> parses data -> computes differences -> outputs report.",
  "anomalies": "Uses an infinite loop for continuous monitoring; no cleanup or exit condition; no suspicious code behaviors or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script repeatedly opens /proc/interrupts, parses interrupt data, and reports the most active interrupts based on changes over time. It utilizes regex for parsing, numpy for calculations, and simple print statements for reporting. The code appears to be a system monitoring tool without any external data transmission, credential handling, or system modification functions. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The infinite loop suggests intended continuous monitoring, which is typical for such tools. No signs of malware, code injection, or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate system monitoring script designed for analyzing interrupt activity on a Linux system. There are no indicators of malicious intent or malicious behaviors. It functions as a system utility without performing any harmful actions or data exfiltration.",
