  "conclusion": "The code is a standard plugin system implementation with inherent risks associated with dynamic imports from external, unvalidated sources. There is no evidence of malicious intent or malware within the code itself. The primary security concern is ensuring that interface specifications and extension modules are validated and sourced from trusted origins to prevent exploitation."
