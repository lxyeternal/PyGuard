  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the reported issues with the code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code performs dynamic module imports (`import_module`) based on interface specifications obtained from `get_interface_groups()`.\n- It then assigns interface callables to the global namespace.\n- It also conditionally loads extensions via `load_extensions()` if in 'python' mode.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or explicit malicious code are present.\n- The primary concern is the potential for malicious or compromised interface specifications or extension modules, given the dynamic import pattern.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Correctly summarizes the code's role.\n- **Analysis:** Highlights the dynamic import and potential risk if interface specs are compromised.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious code present; risk depends on external data trustworthiness.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.4, Confidence = 0.7.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is sound. The code itself is not malicious but relies on external data integrity. The risk score of 0.4 seems appropriate given the potential for malicious interface specs.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes dynamic import risks.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes that `import_module()` with untrusted input could be risky.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior observed; risks depend on external data.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.4, Confidence = 0.7.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with Report 1. The risk score seems reasonable. The reasoning is valid, and no malicious intent is implied.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar overview.\n- **Analysis:** Recognizes the dynamic import pattern and potential for malicious modules if the environment is compromised.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious intent; the pattern is typical for plugin systems.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe lower security risk score (0.2) aligns with the reasoning that the code itself is safe, but external extension management could be a vector. The high confidence score (0.9) is justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar to previous.\n- **Analysis:** Notes that dynamic import and assignment to globals is standard but could be risky if environment is compromised.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; typical plugin pattern.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with prior assessments. The risk score seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose:** Same overall.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly points out that untrusted data could lead to malicious module import.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent; potential risk if data sources are compromised.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.3, Confidence = 0.8.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe slightly higher risk score (0.3) reflects the concern about untrusted data sources. This is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Security risk scores:** Range from 0.2 to 0.4, reflecting the inherent risk in dynamic import patterns if external data is compromised.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — moderate, due to reliance on external interface specifications and extension modules, which if compromised, could lead to code execution vulnerabilities.\n\n**Final note:**  \nThe code's pattern is common in plugin architectures. The primary security concern is ensuring that interface specifications and extension modules are validated and sourced from trusted origins. Proper sandboxing or validation could mitigate these risks further.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | My Estimate |\n|------------------|--------------|\n| Malware          | 0            |\n| Obfuscated       | 0            |\n| Security Risk    | 0.2          |\n\nThe reports' scores are consistent with this assessment.",
