  "purpose": "The code initializes the coverage measurement tool for code coverage analysis.",
  "sources": "The import statement imports the 'coverage' module, and the call to 'coverage.process_startup()' executes at startup.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data affects security or leaks occur.",
  "flows": "The flow is from the imported module to the function call, which initializes coverage tracking.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only setting up coverage measurement; no anomalies or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'coverage' library and calls 'coverage.process_startup()' to begin coverage analysis at process startup. There are no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward and serves a standard purpose related to test coverage collection.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate setup for code coverage measurement and contains no malicious or security-threatening behavior.",
