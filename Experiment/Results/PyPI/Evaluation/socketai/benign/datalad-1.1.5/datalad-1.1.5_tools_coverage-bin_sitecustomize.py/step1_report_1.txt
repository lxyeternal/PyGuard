  "purpose": "Initialize code coverage measurement for testing or profiling purposes.",
  "sources": "The import statement for the 'coverage' module and the 'coverage.process_startup()' function call.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Importing 'coverage' is static; 'coverage.process_startup()' executes directly after import, performing initialization.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'coverage.process_startup()' suggests intent to alter or hook into code coverage mechanisms, which is standard for testing but could be misused in malicious contexts if the package were compromised. No other suspicious or unusual code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'coverage' module, a standard library used for measuring code coverage in testing. The call to 'coverage.process_startup()' is a function designed to hook into the process startup for coverage measurement. There are no indications of data handling, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. This code appears to be a minimal setup for coverage analysis, which is common in testing environments.",
  "conclusion": "This script performs standard initialization for code coverage analysis and does not contain malicious behavior. No security risks or malware indications are evident from this minimal code snippet.",
