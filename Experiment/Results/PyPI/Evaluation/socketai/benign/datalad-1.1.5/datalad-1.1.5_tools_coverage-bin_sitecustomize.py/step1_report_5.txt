{
  "purpose": "To initiate code coverage measurement, likely for testing or code analysis purposes.",
  "sources": "The import of the 'coverage' library and the call to 'coverage.process_startup()'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "The import of 'coverage' leads to executing 'coverage.process_startup()' during startup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns; straightforward usage of a known library for coverage measurement.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'coverage' module, which is used for measuring code coverage during testing. It then calls 'coverage.process_startup()', which is a standard function to initialize coverage measurement at the start of the process. No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious code is present. The code appears to be legitimate and focused solely on coverage instrumentation without any hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal, benign snippet intended to start code coverage measurement. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks.",
