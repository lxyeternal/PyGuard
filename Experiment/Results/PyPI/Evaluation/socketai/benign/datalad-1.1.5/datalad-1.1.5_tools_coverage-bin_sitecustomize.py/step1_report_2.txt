  "purpose": "Initialize and start code coverage measurement for testing or profiling purposes.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'import coverage' and the function call 'coverage.process_startup()'.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external outputs observed.",
  "flows": "N/A – straightforward initialization without data flow paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; usage of a standard code coverage library and function.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'coverage' library, which is a standard tool for measuring code coverage during testing. The call to 'coverage.process_startup()' initiates the coverage measurement process. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious system commands. The code is minimal and typical for coverage setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup for code coverage measurement with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
