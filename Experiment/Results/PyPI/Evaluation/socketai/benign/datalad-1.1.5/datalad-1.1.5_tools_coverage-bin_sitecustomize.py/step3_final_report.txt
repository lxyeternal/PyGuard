  "purpose": "Initialize code coverage measurement during testing or profiling by invoking coverage.process_startup().",
  "sources": "Import of the 'coverage' module and call to 'coverage.process_startup()'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, external communication, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Import of 'coverage' module -> call to 'coverage.process_startup()' with no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is minimal, straightforward, and uses standard library functions without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a well-known testing library 'coverage' and calls its startup function. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The code is typical for setting up code coverage in testing environments. No untrusted data handling, external communication, or obfuscation is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup for code coverage measurement with no malicious intent or security risks. The existing reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
