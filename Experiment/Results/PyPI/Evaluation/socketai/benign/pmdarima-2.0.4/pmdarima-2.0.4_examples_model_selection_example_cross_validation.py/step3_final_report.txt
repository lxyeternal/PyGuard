{
  "purpose": "This code demonstrates cross-validation of time series models using pmdarima on a public dataset, performing data loading, splitting, model training, and evaluation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from pm.datasets.load_wineind() and the model_selection.train_test_split() function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, network calls, or external data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded, split into train/test, models are trained, cross-validation is performed, and scores are compared.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard libraries and functions for time series analysis, with straightforward logic. It loads a public dataset, performs a train/test split, defines ARIMA models, applies sliding window cross-validation, and compares SMAPE scores. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. The code's behavior aligns with typical data science practices, and all signals indicate benign intent. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the code's transparent and standard operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign example of time series model validation with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks detected. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
