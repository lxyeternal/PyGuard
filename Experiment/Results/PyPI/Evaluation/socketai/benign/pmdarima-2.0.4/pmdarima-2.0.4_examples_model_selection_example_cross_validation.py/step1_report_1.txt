{
  "purpose": "This code demonstrates cross-validation of time series models using the pmdarima library for model selection on a dataset.",
  "sources": "Reads dataset via pm.datasets.load_wineind() and uses train_test_split from pmdarima.model_selection for data splitting.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data leakage, network activity, or sensitive data handling is observed.",
  "flows": "Loads data -> splits data -> defines models -> performs cross-validation -> evaluates and compares models.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are detected. The code appears standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script loads a public dataset, splits it into training and test sets, defines two ARIMA models, performs cross-validation using a sliding window approach, and compares their SMAPE scores to select the better model. All operations are standard for model evaluation and do not exhibit malicious intent. No suspicious network activity, hidden code, or backdoors are present. Use of the pmdarima library, standard data processing, and model evaluation steps indicate typical data science practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate for model validation purposes and does not contain malware or security risks. It simply performs standard time series modeling procedures using well-known libraries.",
