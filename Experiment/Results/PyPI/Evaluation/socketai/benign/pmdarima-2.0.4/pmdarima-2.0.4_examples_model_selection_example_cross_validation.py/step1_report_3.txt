{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform time series model validation using cross-validation techniques on a dataset loaded from the pmdarima library.",
  "sources": "Data loading from pmdarima datasets (load_wineind), user input or environment variables are not used; the code uses fixed parameters and static data.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs results via print statements; no untrusted data is written to external systems or files. No external network connections or data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (dataset) flows through model training and cross-validation score calculations, then results are printed; no untrusted input flows into insecure sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. All model parameters and data are statically defined; no dynamic code execution or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script loads a dataset, performs model training, cross-validation, and compares results with clear, standard procedures. There are no signs of malicious activity such as network communication, data theft, or backdoors. It appears to be a legitimate time series validation example using pmdarima.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward example of model validation for time series data without any malicious intent or security risks. It is safe to use.",
