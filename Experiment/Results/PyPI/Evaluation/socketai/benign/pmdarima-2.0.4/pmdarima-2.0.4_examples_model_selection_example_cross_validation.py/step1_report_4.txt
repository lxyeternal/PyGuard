{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to demonstrate cross-validation of time series models using the pmdarima library, including data loading, model training, and evaluation.",
  "sources": "Data loading via pm.datasets.load_wineind(), model initialization, and cross-validation scoring functions.",
  "sinks": "Output printing of CV scores, model comparison, and version information. No data sinks or untrusted data outputs are detected.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded from a trusted dataset, processed by standard library functions, and results are printed to standard output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic. The code uses standard libraries and straightforward functions.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard operations: importing libraries, loading a public dataset, splitting data, training ARIMA models, performing cross-validation, and printing results. There are no signs of code injection, malicious network activity, or privacy leaks. It adheres to typical data analysis workflows, with no obfuscated code, hidden behaviors, or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate demonstration of time series model validation using pmdarima, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
