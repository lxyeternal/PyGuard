{
  "purpose": "Demonstrates the use of pmdarima's pipeline for time series forecasting with auto_arima, including data loading, model training, prediction, and visualization.",
  "sources": "Loading dataset via pm.datasets.load_wineind(); importing libraries such as numpy, pmdarima, matplotlib.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; code only performs standard data processing and visualization.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded from a trusted dataset, processed through a pipeline (FourierFeaturizer and AutoARIMA), then used for predictions and plotting.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed. No obfuscated code, malicious functions, or data exfiltration attempts detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports public libraries, loads a known dataset, constructs a pipeline with standard time series transformations and modeling, performs predictions, and visualizes results. No external or untrusted data inputs, no suspicious code execution, and no network communication. The process aligns with typical data analysis workflows. No anomalies or malicious constructs detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate example of using pmdarima's pipeline for time series forecasting. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, data theft, or security risks. It is a standard implementation for statistical modeling and visualization.",
