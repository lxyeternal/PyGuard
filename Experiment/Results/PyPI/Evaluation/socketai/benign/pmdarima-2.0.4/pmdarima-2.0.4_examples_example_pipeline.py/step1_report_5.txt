  "purpose": "Demonstrate usage of pmdarima pipeline for time series forecasting with auto_arima, including data loading, training, prediction, and visualization.",
  "sources": "Loading dataset via pm.datasets.load_wineind(); data splitting via model_selection.train_test_split(); user input is limited to dataset loading and model parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks observed; no external network communication or data exfiltration mechanisms present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from dataset loading to training, then to prediction and visualization; no untrusted data influences model training or prediction beyond dataset and parameters provided internally.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden malicious functions identified. The code is straightforward, involving standard library usage and visualization.",
  "analysis": "The code loads a public dataset, applies a pipeline consisting of a FourierFeaturizer and AutoARIMA, performs training, predictions, and plotting. No suspicious external calls, code injection, or obfuscated code are present. It appears to be a typical example or test script for forecasting using pmdarima. There are no anomalies or malicious indicators detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard time series forecasting using pmdarima without any malicious intent or security risks. It is a typical example script with no signs of malware or security issues.",
