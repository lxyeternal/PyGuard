  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward implementation of pmdarima's pipeline for time series forecasting, including data loading, model fitting, prediction, updating, and visualization.\n- All reports agree that the code uses standard libraries, loads a public dataset, and performs typical statistical modeling tasks.\n- No external data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code appears to be a legitimate example or tutorial script.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of issues**: None of the reports mention any issues with the code; all agree that the code is benign and standard.\n- **Errors or flaws**: No errors, flaws, or mistakes are noted in the code or the reports.\n\n### Scores assessment:\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|-----------|--------------|-------|\n| 1       | 0         | 0            | 0     |\n| 2       | 0         | 0            | 0     |\n| 3       | 0         | 0            | 0     |\n| 4       | 0         | 0            | 0     |\n| 5       | 0         | 0            | 0.1   |\n\n**Analysis of scores:**\n\n- **Malware score**: All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated score**: All assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk score**: Most reports assign 0, with one (report 5) assigning 0.1. Given the code's benign nature, a risk score higher than 0.1 is unwarranted.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**\n\n- The risk score in report 5 (0.1) is reasonable, considering it's a minimal concern, but overall, the code does not pose any security risk.\n- No reason to increase the malware or obfuscated scores.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n\n- Since the code is purely for data analysis and visualization, with no external or malicious interactions, the risk score should remain very low.\n- The highest risk score observed (0.1) is acceptable, but I would suggest keeping it at **0** for consistency unless future context indicates otherwise.\n\n### Malware score justification:\n\n- No malicious behavior is present; the code does not perform any suspicious actions.\n- Therefore, **malware score should be 0**.\n\n### Obfuscated code:\n\n- No obfuscation detected; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Obfuscated score should be 0**.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score**: **0**\n- **Obfuscated score**: **0**\n- **Risk score**: **0**\n\nThis aligns with the overall consensus that the code is a benign, standard example of using pmdarima for time series forecasting.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n| Score Type      | Final Value | Justification                                              |\n|-----------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0            | No malicious activity or suspicious code detected.          |\n| Obfuscated      | 0            | Code is clear, straightforward, and well-documented.       |\n| Security Risk   | 0            | No external threats, data exfiltration, or vulnerabilities. |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risk.",
