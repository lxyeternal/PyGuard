{
  "purpose": "This code demonstrates how to perform cross-validation predictions on a time-series dataset using the pmdarima library, specifically for forecasting with an ARIMA model.",
  "sources": "Reads dataset via pm.datasets.load_wineind(), reads library version info, and loads data for modeling.",
  "sinks": "Uses the cross_val_predict function to generate predictions; plots the original data and forecasts.",
  "flows": "Loads dataset -> builds model -> performs cross-validation -> generates predictions -> plots results.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No unusual dynamic code execution or obfuscation present. Library usage is standard for time-series forecasting.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward and uses the pmdarima library for forecasting. It loads a public dataset, sets up an ARIMA model, performs cross-validation with a sliding window, and plots the results. No external network connections or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code appears to be for legitimate analytical purposes without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard time-series forecasting example utilizing pmdarima. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It does not contain obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious data handling.",
