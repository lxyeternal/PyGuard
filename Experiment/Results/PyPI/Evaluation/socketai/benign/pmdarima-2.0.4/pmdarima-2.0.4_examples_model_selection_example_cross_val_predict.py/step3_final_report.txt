{
  "purpose": "The code performs time-series forecasting using pmdarima's ARIMA model with cross-validation on a trusted dataset, then visualizes the results.",
  "sources": "The dataset loaded via pm.datasets.load_wineind() and the ARIMA model parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; visualization is local, with no network activity.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded from a trusted source, processed through the ARIMA model, and predictions are visualized locally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward and uses standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The script loads a public dataset, constructs an ARIMA model, performs cross-validation predictions, and plots the results. It uses trusted libraries (pmdarima, numpy, matplotlib) without any network activity, external data fetching beyond the trusted dataset, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are evident. The code's purpose is legitimate data analysis and visualization. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence levels. There are no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, transparent, and uses standard libraries for time-series forecasting. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
