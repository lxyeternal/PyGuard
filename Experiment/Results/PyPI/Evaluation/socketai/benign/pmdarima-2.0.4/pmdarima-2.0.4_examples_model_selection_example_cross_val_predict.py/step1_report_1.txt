{
  "purpose": "The code performs cross-validation forecasting on a time-series dataset (wineind), including visualization of predictions.",
  "sources": "The code loads a dataset using pm.datasets.load_wineind() and processes data internally within the script.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that handle untrusted data or perform potentially harmful actions.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded from a trusted dataset source, passed through a time-series forecasting process, and visualized locally with matplotlib. No external network transmission or system modification occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious constructs are present. The code uses standard libraries and functions without dynamic code execution or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script loads a public dataset, constructs an ARIMA model, performs cross-validation predictions, and visualizes the results. It uses established libraries (pmdarima, numpy, matplotlib) and includes no user input handling or external data fetching beyond trusted datasets. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments. The code's purpose appears to be legitimate data analysis and visualization, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data analysis script that performs time-series cross-validation and visualization. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The script solely processes and visualizes data without network communication or system modification.",
