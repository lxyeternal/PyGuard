{
  "purpose": "The code performs cross-validation forecasting on the wineind dataset using the pmdarima library, then plots the original data and forecasts.",
  "sources": "Reads dataset from pmdarima's built-in datasets load_wineind() function, and imports data via library functions.",
  "sinks": "Data is used internally for prediction and visualization; no untrusted data input or external data exfiltration is evident.",
  "flows": "Dataset loaded -> Model trained -> Cross-validation predictions generated -> Predictions plotted",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The script loads a standard dataset, sets up an ARIMA model, performs cross-validation with a sliding window, and plots the results. All operations use trusted libraries and functions. No signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose of time-series forecasting and visualization. No anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for predictive analysis using established libraries. It does not exhibit malicious intent or security risks.",
