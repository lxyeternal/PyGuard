{
  "purpose": "The code loads a public dataset (sunspots), visualizes it, applies a Box-Cox transformation, and visualizes again, serving as a time series analysis example.",
  "sources": "Dataset loading via datasets.load_sunspots, data visualization functions, and the BoxCoxEndogTransformer fitting and transforming the data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs, no network or file outputs, no data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded from a static dataset (source), visualized, transformed with Box-Cox (sink), and visualized again.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data loading, visualization, and transformation steps using well-known libraries. It does not involve external inputs, network activity, or malicious operations. The use of a very small lambda in Box-Cox is a common statistical practice, not malicious. All functions and data are public and static. No anomalies or suspicious constructs are present. The code's behavior is benign, and the operations are typical for time series analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard data analysis script with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and risk should all be zero, reflecting its safe nature.",
