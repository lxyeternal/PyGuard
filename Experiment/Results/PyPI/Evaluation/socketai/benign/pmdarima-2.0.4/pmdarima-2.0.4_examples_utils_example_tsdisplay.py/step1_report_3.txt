{
  "purpose": "The code loads a time series dataset, visualizes it, applies a Box-Cox transformation, and visualizes the transformed data to analyze characteristics for forecasting purposes.",
  "sources": "The data source is 'datasets.load_sunspots(True)', which loads a public dataset from the pmdarima library. No external untrusted input is used.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted or malicious data flows to, nor any output that could leak sensitive information. The code only outputs plots and print statements.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the dataset loading (source) to transformations and visualizations. No untrusted input flows into the system; the data is static and publicly available.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors are observed. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. The use of standard libraries and functions is normal.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries for time series analysis, loads a known public dataset (sunspots), visualizes the original series, applies a Box-Cox transformation using a known preprocessing class, and visualizes the transformed data. All code uses well-documented, open-source functions without any suspicious activity or obfuscated code. No external inputs are processed that could introduce malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, benign example of time series data visualization and transformation for forecasting. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
