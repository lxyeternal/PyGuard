{
  "purpose": "The code loads and visualizes a time series dataset (sunspots) and applies a Box-Cox transformation to analyze data distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'datasets.load_sunspots' function, which loads a predefined dataset from the pmdarima library.",
  "sinks": "The code does not send data over the network, write to files, or execute untrusted input. It primarily processes and visualizes data internally.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded from the pmdarima datasets; it is then transformed via Box-Cox and visualized. No external input flows into the data processing pipeline.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code constructs are present. The code uses standard library functions and clear data processing steps.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a well-known open-source library, pmdarima, loads a public dataset (sunspots), and performs data visualization and a Box-Cox transformation. There are no external inputs, untrusted data sources, or suspicious operations. The data processing is straightforward, involving dataset loading, visualization, and transformation, all of which are typical in data analysis workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard data analysis script that loads and visualizes a public dataset, applies a common transformation, and does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. There are no indicators of malware or security risks.",
