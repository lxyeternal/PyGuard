{
  "purpose": "The code loads and visualizes a time series dataset (sunspots) and applies a Box-Cox transformation for analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads the sunspots dataset via pmdarima's datasets.load_sunspots() function.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any obvious sinks that handle untrusted data or output that could lead to data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded from the dataset, visualized, then transformed using Box-Cox, and visualized again.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, unusual code, or obfuscated segments. The code is straightforward and uses well-known libraries for time series analysis.",
  "analysis": "The script loads a standard dataset, performs statistical visualization, applies a common data transformation, and visualizes again. It does not perform any network operations, file manipulations, or system modifications. The imports and dataset handling are standard for data analysis workflows. No suspicious behavior or malicious code is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard data analysis script utilizing open-source libraries for time series visualization and transformation. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe and serves its purpose of data analysis.",
