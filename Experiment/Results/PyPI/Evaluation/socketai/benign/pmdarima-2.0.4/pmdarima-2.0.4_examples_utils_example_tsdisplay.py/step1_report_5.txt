{
  "purpose": "To analyze and visualize time series data, specifically the sunspots dataset, including applying a Box-Cox transformation for normalization.",
  "sources": "Imports from pmdarima library, loading the sunspots dataset, and printing data shape and head.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded from a trusted dataset source, transformed using a standard transformer, and displayed via plotting functions. No untrusted data flows are apparent.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are present. All library imports and function calls are standard and well-documented.",
  "analysis": "The code loads a standard dataset from a well-known library, performs basic data visualization, and applies a common statistical transformation (Box-Cox). There are no dynamic code executions, network communications, or hidden behaviors. The code is straightforward and appears to serve its analytical purpose without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard data analysis and visualization routine with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It uses trusted libraries and functions appropriately.",
