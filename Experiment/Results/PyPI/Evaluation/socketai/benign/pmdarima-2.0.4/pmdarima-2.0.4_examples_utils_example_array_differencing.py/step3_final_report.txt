  "purpose": "Demonstrate array differencing using pmdarima.utils.array.diff for educational purposes.",
  "sources": "Static array 'x' defined within the code.",
  "sinks": "No external data input/output, network activity, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Array 'x' is differenced with various lag and differences parameters; no external data flows into or out of the code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward use of a standard library function on static data.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a utility for array operations, defines a static array, and performs differencing with different parameters. It contains no user input, external data, network activity, or obfuscated/malicious code. The operations are standard and serve an educational purpose. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues are present. The code's simplicity and use of well-known libraries support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, educational demonstration of array differencing with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals indicate a safe and straightforward script.",
