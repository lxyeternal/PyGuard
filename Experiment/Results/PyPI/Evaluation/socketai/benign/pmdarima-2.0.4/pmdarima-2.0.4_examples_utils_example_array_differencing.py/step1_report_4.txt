  "purpose": "Demonstrate the usage of array differencing in time series analysis using the pmdarima.utils.array module.",
  "sources": "Reads the array data defined in variable 'x' and the imported 'array' module.",
  "sinks": "Outputs via print statements; no untrusted data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Input array 'x' -> array.diff function -> printed output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a utility module, creates a sample array, performs differencing operations, and prints results. There are no external data inputs or untrusted sources. The code uses standard library functions for numerical operations and outputs data to the console. No suspicious or malicious code behaviors, such as network access, file operations, or hidden backdoors, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward demonstration of array differencing in time series analysis. It contains no malicious intent or security risks.",
