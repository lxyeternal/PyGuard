  "purpose": "Demonstrate the use of array differencing in time series analysis using the pmdarima.utils.array module.",
  "sources": "Imports from pmdarima.utils (array), hardcoded array data (x), and the __doc__ string.",
  "sinks": "Print statements for displaying results; no untrusted data sources or outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from hardcoded array x through array.diff functions, with results printed to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward demonstration code with no unusual code constructs or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a utility module, constructs a sample array, performs differencing with varying parameters, and prints the results. No external input or untrusted data sources are used. No obfuscated code or suspicious function calls are present. The usage of the array.diff function appears standard and aligns with normal time series processing practices.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign demonstration script for array differencing in time series analysis. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
