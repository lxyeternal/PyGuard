{
  "purpose": "Demonstrates persisting and loading an ARIMA model for time series forecasting.",
  "sources": "Reads dataset 'load_wineind' from pmdarima's datasets module.",
  "targets": "Uses joblib to dump and load the ARIMA model to/from a pickle file.",
  "flows": "Dataset loaded -> ARIMA model fitted -> Model dumped to file -> Model loaded from file -> Predictions generated.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or backdoors observed. Usage of joblib for model persistence is standard practice. No obfuscated code or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code loads a dataset, trains an ARIMA model, serializes it using joblib, then deserializes it to generate predictions, and finally cleans up the pickle file. All operations are standard for model persistence. No malicious or suspicious behavior, no data leaks, and no harmful system actions detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward example of model persistence and usage with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
