  "purpose": "Demonstrates how to persist and reload an ARIMA model for time series forecasting.",
  "sources": "Reads dataset 'load_wineind' from pmdarima's dataset module.",
  "sinks": "Writes a pickle file 'arima.pkl' to disk and reads it back for model reloading.",
  "flows": "Loads dataset -> Fits ARIMA model -> Dumps model to disk -> Loads model from disk -> Makes predictions.",
  "anomalies": "Uses joblib to dump and load the model; no suspicious or malicious code observed. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code loads a public dataset, fits an ARIMA model, and serializes it to disk using joblib. It then reloads the model and makes predictions, finally cleaning up the file. There are no signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious commands. No use of untrusted input sources or unsafe code practices. The code performs standard model persistence operations typical in machine learning workflows.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward, benign example of persisting and reloading an ARIMA model for forecasting. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
