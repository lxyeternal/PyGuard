  "purpose": "The code demonstrates how to persist an ARIMA model to disk and reload it for future predictions.",
  "sources": "Reads data from pm.datasets.load_wineind(), loads and saves model via joblib, reads/writes file 'arima.pkl', accesses environment variables (implied by imports but not used).",
  "sinks": "joblib.dump and joblib.load for serializing/deserializing the model, os.unlink for file deletion.",
  "flows": "Loads data -> Fits model -> Dumps model to 'arima.pkl' -> Loads model from 'arima.pkl' -> Predicts on test data -> Deletes 'arima.pkl'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code structures, no obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, no hidden backdoors or data leaks detected.",
  "analysis": "The script loads a dataset, trains an ARIMA model, serializes the model to disk, reloads it, makes predictions, and then deletes the saved file. All operations are standard and do not involve any malicious behavior or security-sensitive data handling. There are no external network connections, no use of environment variables for secrets, and no code that manipulates or leaks data maliciously. Use of joblib for persistence is common and safe in this context. The code performs a typical machine learning model persistence task without any suspicious or malicious components.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard example of persisting and reloading a machine learning model using joblib. It contains no indicators of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The overall security risk is negligible.",
