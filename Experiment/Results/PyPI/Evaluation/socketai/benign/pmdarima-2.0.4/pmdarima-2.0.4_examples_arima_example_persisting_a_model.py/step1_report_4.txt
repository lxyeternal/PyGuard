  "purpose": "Demonstrate how to persist and reload an ARIMA model for time series forecasting.",
  "sources": "Loading dataset using pmdarima.datasets.load_wineind(), user input from environment if any, and reading/writing the pickle file 'arima.pkl'.",
  "sinks": "Saving the model to 'arima.pkl' using joblib.dump(), and deleting the file after use with os.unlink().",
  "flows": "Dataset is loaded from the package, model is trained, saved to disk, then loaded back for predictions, then the file is deleted.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code; no hardcoded credentials, network calls, or suspicious file manipulations beyond typical serialization/deserialization. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code loads a public dataset, trains an ARIMA model, serializes it with joblib, then deserializes and uses it for prediction. It also deletes the pickle file afterward. No external inputs, network activity, or suspicious operations are present. The use of joblib for model persistence is standard practice, and the file deletion ensures cleanup. No malicious intent or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs standard model persistence and prediction tasks with no signs of malicious activity. It appears to be a benign demonstration of model serialization in Python.",
