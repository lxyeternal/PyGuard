{
  "purpose": "This code demonstrates how to persist an ARIMA model to disk after training, then reload it for forecasting, using standard libraries and practices.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from pmdarima's load_wineind() dataset and performs file operations with joblib and os.unlink.",
  "sinks": "The code writes the serialized model to 'arima.pkl' and deletes it afterward; no untrusted data or external network activity is involved.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded from a dataset, the model is trained, serialized to disk, then deserialized, and predictions are made based on the reloaded model.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code follows typical ML persistence patterns without obfuscation or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard model training, serialization, and cleanup. It uses common libraries and practices, with no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or obfuscation. File operations are typical for ML workflows, and no external inputs or network activity are present. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to file handling, which is standard and safe in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard example of model persistence with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The security risk is very low, and the malware and obfuscation scores should remain at 0. The minimal risk score of 0.1 is appropriate given the file operations involved.",
