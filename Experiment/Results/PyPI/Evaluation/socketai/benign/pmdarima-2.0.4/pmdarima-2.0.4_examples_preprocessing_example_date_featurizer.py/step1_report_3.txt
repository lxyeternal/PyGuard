{
  "purpose": "The script demonstrates creating features from date data, performing time series analysis, and forecasting using the pmdarima library.",
  "sources": "Data is loaded via load_date_example() from pmdarima.datasets._base, and the date features are extracted from the dataset's 'date' column.",
  "sinks": "The code does not send data over a network, write to files, or handle untrusted input in a way that could lead to injection or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded via load_date_example(), processed through date featurization and model training pipelines, and forecasts are generated for plotting.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed. The code uses standard library functions, and no obfuscated or dynamic code execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard data analysis libraries and pmdarima modules, loads a predefined dataset, splits the data, creates date-based features, and applies an ARIMA model in a pipeline. The process involves data transformation, model fitting, and visualization. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The use of external libraries appears legitimate and focused on time series analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical time series modeling example using pmdarima, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It performs data loading, feature engineering, modeling, and visualization safely.",
