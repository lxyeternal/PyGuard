{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates how to create and evaluate a time series model using pmdarima, focusing on feature engineering and forecasting.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the function load_date_example() and imports data through pmdarima's datasets module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the dataset loading function into feature creation, model training, and prediction steps. No external data is transmitted or manipulated in an insecure way.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are observed. The code follows standard data science workflows.",
  "analysis": "The code loads a sample dataset, performs exploratory analysis, creates date-based features, builds an ARIMA model pipeline, and plots predictions. It uses open-source libraries and standard practices. No signs of malicious intent, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoor mechanisms, are detected. The code is well-structured, uses transparent functions, and has no obfuscated or suspicious parts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical example of time series modeling using pmdarima with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
