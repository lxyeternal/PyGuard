{
  "purpose": "This code performs time series modeling using pmdarima, creating date features, fitting an ARIMA model, and visualizing forecasts.",
  "sources": "load_date_example() dataset, date feature creation via preprocessing.DateFeaturizer, user input for data splits",
  "sinks": "Plotting functions (matplotlib), no data exfiltration or external network activity",
  "flows": "Data loaded from dataset -> date features generated -> features used in pipeline -> model fitted -> forecasts predicted -> results plotted",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, straightforward implementation",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard time series analysis script with data loading, feature engineering, model fitting, and plotting. It uses well-known libraries and datasets with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, with no network activity or sensitive data handling. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign and transparent nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, open-source time series modeling example with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The security risk is very low, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
