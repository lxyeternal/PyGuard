{
  "purpose": "The code is designed for time series analysis, specifically modeling quasi-seasonal trends with date features using the pmdarima library. It loads data, creates date-based features, trains an ARIMA model, and plots forecasts.",
  "sources": "Data is loaded via load_date_example() from pmdarima.datasets._base; input data is from this dataset, and date features are generated from the 'date' column in X.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs plots of predictions and actual data, and prints information to the console. There are no evident data leaks, data exfiltration, or other data sinks that could lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "Data flows from load_date_example() into train-test split; date features are generated via DateFeaturizer; features and target data are used to fit the pipeline; predictions flow into plotting functions for visualization.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated segments. The code uses standard library calls and well-known APIs without hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script loads a dataset, creates date-related features, performs train-test splitting, applies an AutoARIMA model in a pipeline, and plots the results. All operations are typical for time series forecasting. No hardcoded secrets, malicious network activity, or suspicious behavior are detected. Use of third-party libraries is standard, and no anomalous code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, legitimate implementation for time series feature engineering and modeling using pmdarima. There are no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated code. The overall security risk is low.",
