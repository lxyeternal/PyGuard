{
  "purpose": "Demonstrates the use of pmdarima's 'c' function for array concatenation, similar to R's c().",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from hardcoded arguments passed to pm.c() functions.",
  "sinks": "Assertions compare the output arrays; no untrusted data or external sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input arguments to pm.c() produce arrays; assertions verify correctness; no data flows to external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and uses standard library functions without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple demonstration of array concatenation using pmdarima's 'c' function. It creates arrays from individual arguments and iterables, then asserts their correctness. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The external dependency 'pmdarima' is standard, and the code does not perform any network operations or data leaks. The reports provided are empty, offering no additional insights or findings. Given the benign nature of the code, the malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and overall security risk is minimal.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, straightforward, and free of malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The empty reports do not indicate any issues. All scores should be set to zero, reflecting the benign and transparent nature of the code.",
