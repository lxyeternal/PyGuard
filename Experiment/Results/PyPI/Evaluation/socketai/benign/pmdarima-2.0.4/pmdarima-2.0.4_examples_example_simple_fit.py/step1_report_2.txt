{
  "purpose": "Demonstrates fitting and evaluating an ARIMA model on a dataset using pmdarima.",
  "sources": "Loads dataset from pmdarima's built-in datasets; reads dataset data for splitting and modeling.",
  "sinks": "Uses the dataset for model training and prediction; outputs a plot of test vs. forecasted values.",
  "flows": "Loads dataset -> splits data -> fits ARIMA model -> predicts -> plots results.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. Uses standard libraries and functions without obfuscation or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries, loads a dataset, performs train-test split, fits an ARIMA model, and visualizes results. No malicious activities or suspicious data handling observed. The dataset is used solely for model evaluation. No external network connections, data exfiltration, or code injection identified. All steps align with typical time series modeling practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward demonstration of ARIMA modeling using pmdarima, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
