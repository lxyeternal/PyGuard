{
  "purpose": "Demonstrates fitting a simple ARIMA model using the pmdarima library on a dataset and plotting predictions versus actual values.",
  "sources": "Loading dataset with pm.datasets.load_wineind(), training/test split with model_selection.train_test_split(), and model fitting with pm.auto_arima().",
  "sinks": "Predict method of the auto_arima object that outputs forecasted values, used for plotting.",
  "flows": "Dataset loading -> train/test split -> model fitting -> prediction -> plotting.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No use of environment variables for secrets, no data exfiltration, and no unusual behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code loads a publicly available dataset, performs a train-test split, fits an auto_arima model with specified parameters, and plots the results. It uses standard libraries and functions with no evidence of malicious intent or hidden behavior. The code appears to be a straightforward demonstration of time series forecasting. No anomalies such as obfuscated code, suspicious network activity, or malicious data handling are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical example of time series modeling using pmdarima with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely performs data loading, modeling, and visualization tasks for demonstration purposes.",
