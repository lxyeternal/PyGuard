  "purpose": "Demonstration of fitting an ARIMA time series model using pmdarima on a public dataset.",
  "sources": "Loading dataset with pm.datasets.load_wineind(), input data for train_test_split, parameters for auto_arima, and data used in plotting.",
  "sinks": "Predictions generated by arima.predict() and plotted in the visualization.",
  "flows": "Data loaded -> split into train/test -> train model with auto_arima -> generate predictions -> plot predictions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments. Usage of standard libraries and public datasets. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script loads a public dataset, splits it into training and testing parts, fits a standard ARIMA model, and plots the results. All libraries are open-source and widely used in data analysis. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system manipulation. The code appears to be a straightforward example of time series forecasting without any suspicious or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign demonstration of time series modeling with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It uses standard libraries and openly available datasets. No anomalies or malicious activities are detected.",
