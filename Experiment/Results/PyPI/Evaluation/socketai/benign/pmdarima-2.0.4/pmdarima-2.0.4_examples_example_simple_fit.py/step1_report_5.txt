{
  "purpose": "To demonstrate fitting a simple ARIMA model to a dataset using the pmdarima library.",
  "sources": "Loading dataset via pm.datasets.load_wineind(), reading data from the loaded dataset.",
  "sinks": "Using arima.predict() to generate forecasts, plotting forecasted data, no other data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded from the pm.datasets module, split into train/test sets, passed into auto_arima for modeling, then used for prediction and visualization.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or hidden operations observed.",
  "analysis": "The code loads a publicly available dataset, performs standard time series modeling with pmdarima, and visualizes the results. No indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious side effects are present. Usage of common libraries and straightforward operations suggests normal functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a benign example of applying an ARIMA model to a dataset for time series forecasting. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
