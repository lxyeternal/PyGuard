{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates fitting an ARIMA model to a time series dataset and visualizing the forecast results.",
  "sources": "Loading dataset via pm.datasets.load_wineind(), user inputs for train/test split, and internal functions within pmdarima.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any untrusted data sinks such as network transmissions, file writes, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from dataset loading to train/test split, then to model fitting, and finally to plotting forecast results; no untrusted source directly affects sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials or hidden behaviors. The code uses standard libraries and methods for data analysis.",
  "analysis": "The script loads a dataset, splits it, fits an ARIMA model, and visualizes predictions. All operations involve standard data processing and modeling without any dynamic code execution, obfuscated segments, or suspicious external interactions. No anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward example of time series forecasting using pmdarima with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscated code, or security vulnerabilities.",
