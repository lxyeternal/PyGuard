{
  "purpose": "Demonstrates fitting and forecasting with an ARIMA model using pmdarima on a public dataset.",
  "sources": "Loading dataset via pm.datasets.load_wineind(), data splitting with model_selection.train_test_split()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network activity or data exfiltration observed",
  "flows": "Data flows from dataset load to train/test split, then to model fitting, and finally to plotting predictions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected; code is straightforward and uses standard libraries",
  "analysis": "The code loads a public dataset, splits it, fits a standard ARIMA model, and plots results. No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The libraries used are open-source and widely trusted. No network activity or data exfiltration is involved. The code's purpose is educational/demo in nature. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign, transparent nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. Security risk is negligible. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
