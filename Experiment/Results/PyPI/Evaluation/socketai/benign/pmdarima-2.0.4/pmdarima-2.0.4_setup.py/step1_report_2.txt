{
  "purpose": "The script configures the setup and build process for the pmdarima Python package, including dependencies, package data, and build commands.",
  "sources": "Reads input from files (requirements.txt, README.md), environment variables, package metadata, and user command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Calls setup() to build/install the package, modifies environment variables for build configurations, unlinks files during cleaning.",
  "flows": "Loads dependencies and configuration files -> sets environment variables and package metadata -> processes command-line args for setup actions -> invokes setup() with collected configs and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a line that sets a global variable 'builtins.__PMDARIMA_SETUP__' to signal setup mode, which could be used for conditional code execution. There are no clear indicators of hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads. The script dynamically loads build extensions and manages build configurations, but this is standard for setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard setup script for a Python package, handling package configuration, dependencies, build commands, and clean-up operations. It uses standard modules and practices, such as reading requirements and version info, configuring build extensions, and conditionally importing modules. The line that sets 'builtins.__PMDARIMA_SETUP__' is a common pattern in package setup scripts for internal signaling. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or malicious behavior is evident. The script does not contain obfuscated code, backdoors, or data leakage mechanisms. All functions and commands are consistent with standard package setup procedures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for the pmdarima package, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs expected tasks related to package configuration and build management. The presence of a global setup indicator is standard practice in complex build scripts and does not indicate malicious intent.",
