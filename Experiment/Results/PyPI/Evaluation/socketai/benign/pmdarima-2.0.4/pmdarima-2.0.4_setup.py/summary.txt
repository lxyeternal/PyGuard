  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script for the pmdarima package. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage mechanisms. The use of a global variable in builtins is a known internal signaling pattern, not malicious. The overall security risk is very low, with a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a low risk score (~0.1-0.2)."
