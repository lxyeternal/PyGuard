{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup.py-like script for configuring, building, and packaging the pmdarima Python library, including dependency checks, build extension setup, and cleanup routines.",
  "sources": "File reads (requirements.txt, README.md), environment variables (e.g., NPY_BLAS_ORDER), import statements (importlib, pmdarima), global variable assignment in builtins (__PMDARIMA_SETUP__), and package metadata definitions.",
  "sinks": "Environment variables for build configuration, file operations for cleanup, importlib for dynamic version retrieval, and setting global variables for internal signaling.",
  "flows": "Reading requirements and version info, setting environment variables, importing modules, assigning global variables, and executing setup routines.",
  "anomalies": "The assignment of a global variable __PMDARIMA_SETUP__ in builtins to signal setup mode; this is a known pattern for internal control during complex build processes, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks: dependency checks, build configuration, cleanup routines, and metadata setup. The use of a global variable in builtins is a known internal signaling pattern. No network activity, data exfiltration, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The routines and patterns are typical for a Python package build script, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script for the pmdarima package. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage mechanisms. The use of a global variable in builtins is a known internal signaling pattern, not malicious. The overall security risk is very low, with a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a low risk score (~0.1-0.2).",
