{
  "purpose": "The code sets up and configures the pmdarima Python package, handling dependencies, build extensions, and packaging metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from files ('README.md', 'requirements.txt'), environment variables, and package imports.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leak points include printing requirements and version info; build files and Cython extensions are manipulated, but no evidence of data leakage or untrusted output is detected.",
  "flows": "Input from files and environment variables flows into configuration and setup functions; package import and version checks flow into build logic; no suspicious source-to-sink data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code employs standard setup procedures. The only noteworthy aspect is setting a global variable (__PMDARIMA_SETUP__) for internal detection, which is benign.",
  "analysis": "The script performs package setup and build configuration, including version checks, dependency handling, and cleanup routines. It reads files for metadata, manages build extensions, and executes the setup process. No malicious functions, network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. The use of print statements for logging is typical. The code adheres to normal packaging workflows without any suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It performs typical build and configuration tasks safely. The presence of environment variable manipulation and dependency checks is standard in setup scripts, and there are no indicators of malware or security risks.",
