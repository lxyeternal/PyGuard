  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Summary:** The script is a standard setup for a Python package, handling dependencies, build, and cleanup. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected.  \n- **Key points:** Use of global variable `__PMDARIMA_SETUP__` is a common pattern; no suspicious network activity or code injection.  \n- **Risk & malware scores:** Both set to 0, consistent with the analysis.  \n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior or supply chain risk evident.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes standard package configuration, dependency management, and the use of a global variable for internal signaling. No signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Key points:** No suspicious code, backdoors, or data leaks.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; security risk is low (0.1–0.2).  \n- **Conclusion:** Standard setup script, no malicious intent.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Summary:** Again, a typical setup script with version checks, dependencies, and build configuration. The global variable `__PMDARIMA_SETUP__` is noted as unusual but benign.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; security risk is low.  \n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Summary:** Similar findings; no malicious activity, just build and configuration routines. The global variable use is unconventional but not malicious.  \n- **Scores:** Both malware and obfuscated are 0; low security risk.  \n- **Conclusion:** Standard setup script, no malicious intent.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Summary:** Same as others—standard setup and build configuration, no malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; minimal security risk.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Code presence & logic:** All reports confirm the code is a typical setup script for a Python package (`pmdarima`) with no malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.  \n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The only unusual pattern is setting a global variable in `builtins` (`__PMDARIMA_SETUP__`), which is a known technique to signal setup context, not malicious.  \n- **External dependencies & file operations:** All operations are standard—reading files, managing dependencies, cleaning build artifacts. No suspicious network activity or data exfiltration is present.  \n- **Obfuscation & malware:** No obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or malware signatures are evident.  \n\n### Final Scores & Justification:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — No malicious activity, payload, or backdoors are present.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.  \n- **Risk score:** **0.2** — Slightly elevated due to the global variable and extensive file operations, but these are standard in build scripts and do not pose a security threat. Overall, the risk remains very low.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n**The code is a standard, well-structured setup script for the pmdarima package, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or supply chain sabotage.** The use of global variables and environment modifications are typical in complex build scripts and do not indicate malicious behavior.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0, 0, and 0.2 respectively, aligning with the detailed analysis above.",
