{
  "purpose": "The script configures the setup and installation process for the pmdarima Python package, including dependency management, build customization, and packaging metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading requirements from 'requirements.txt'; accessing package versions via importlib; reading 'README.md' for long description; reading files and directories during clean operations; environment variables during build extension; importing setup tools and numpy modules.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of code via importlib (e.g., dynamic package version checks); modification of environment variables (NPY_BLAS_ORDER, NPY_LAPACK_ORDER); deletion of files and directories during cleanup; use of exec or dynamic code in setup or build extensions (though not explicitly present); passing potentially untrusted data to setup() functions.",
  "flows": "Importing package version info via importlib -> environment variables during build -> file operations during cleanup -> configuration data passed to setup() -> reading external files for descriptions and requirements.",
  "anomalies": "Use of builtins.__PMDARIMA_SETUP__ as a global flag; dynamic modification of environment variables based on platform and version; extensive cleanup logic that deletes build artifacts; conditional importing of numpy and setuptools, possibly influenced by external environment; use of exec-like patterns within build extensions and configuration (though not explicit code execution).",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a setup script for the pmdarima package, configuring build, dependencies, and metadata. It dynamically reads external files and manages environment variables, but all operations appear to be standard for package setup. The use of global variables and cleanup procedures could potentially be exploited if an attacker manipulates files or environment, but no explicit malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activities are present. No code injection, data exfiltration, or unauthorized system access routines are evident. The script does not contain obfuscated code, malicious backdoors, or hidden behaviors. The dynamic environment variable modification and extensive file cleanup are typical in build scripts and not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard setup script with no indications of malicious intent or supply chain sabotage. It handles package configuration, dependency checks, and cleanup procedures typical for Python packaging. There are no signs of malware or malicious behavior. The overall security risk is low.",
