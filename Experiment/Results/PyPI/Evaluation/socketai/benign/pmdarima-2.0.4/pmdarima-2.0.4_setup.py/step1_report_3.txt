{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to set up and configure the 'pmdarima' Python package for distribution, including handling dependencies, build artifacts, and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads package requirements from 'requirements.txt', reads long description from 'README.md', reads package version from 'pmdarima' module, and gathers metadata for setup.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'importlib.import_module' to load 'pmdarima', and executes 'setup()' to install the package; no direct untrusted data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Reads data from files and modules, uses the data to configure package metadata, dependencies, and build instructions; does not process untrusted input for execution.",
  "anomalies": "The code sets a global variable '__PMDARIMA_SETUP__' in 'builtins' to detect setup context, which is unconventional but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code does include verbose print statements and comments but nothing suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup procedures, including version checks, dependency management, and build configuration. It includes a custom clean command for build artifacts removal and conditional logic for handling different Python versions and build environments. No obfuscated code, suspicious network activity, or malicious behaviors are detected. The 'import pmdarima' call is legitimate for version retrieval. The global variable assignment in 'builtins' is unusual but serves a setup detection purpose. Overall, the script follows typical setup.py patterns with no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for the 'pmdarima' package, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It performs necessary package configuration tasks securely and transparently.",
