  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard setup tasks—reading requirements, version info, long description, cleaning files.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No suspicious data sinks; environment variables are set during build, which is typical.\n- **Anomalies:** The global variable `builtins.__PMDARIMA_SETUP__` is set, which is a common pattern for internal signaling during setup.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The cleanup routines are standard for build artifacts.\n- **Conclusion:** Low risk, no malware detected, confidence 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The code appears benign, typical for a setup script. The global variable is an internal indicator, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar setup and build configuration, with dependency checks.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data sinks; environment variables are manipulated for build configurations.\n- **Anomalies:** Setting `builtins.__PMDARIMA_SETUP__` again, standard in complex build scripts.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity; the script performs expected setup tasks.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, confidence 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The script is a standard setup process, nothing suspicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Reads version info from the package, requirements, and metadata.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uses `importlib` to load the package; no untrusted data flows.\n- **Anomalies:** The global variable in `builtins` is unusual but not malicious.\n- **Analysis:** Typical setup script; no malware or backdoors.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, confidence 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Standard setup code, no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Handles setup, environment, and source files.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks or suspicious sinks; configuration is standard.\n- **Anomalies:** Setting a global variable in `builtins`, which is unconventional but benign.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity; standard build procedures.\n- **Conclusion:** No security risk, confidence 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar setup and build configuration.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No suspicious data flows; logging and environment variables are standard.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of global variable `__PMDARIMA_SETUP__`, which is benign.\n- **Analysis:** Typical setup script, no malicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** No malware, confidence 0.9.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Code presence of malware or malicious intent:** No. All reports indicate standard setup procedures.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, primarily because no malicious activity or backdoors are present.\n- **Global variable `__PMDARIMA_SETUP__`:** Unusual but common in complex build scripts for internal signaling, not malicious.\n\n### **Final Expert Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1 to 0.2** (very low, typical for build scripts)\n\nThe reports are consistent and correctly interpret the code as a standard, benign setup script. No signs of supply chain sabotage or malicious code are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a typical setup.py script for a Python package, with no malicious or suspicious behaviors. The global variable used for internal signaling is standard practice and does not indicate malicious intent. The overall security posture is very low risk.",
