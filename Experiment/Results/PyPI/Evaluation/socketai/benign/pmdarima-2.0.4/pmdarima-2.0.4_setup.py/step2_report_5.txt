  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their claims, and determine the actual security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Summary:**\n- Purpose: Standard setup script.\n- Findings: Uses importlib to get package version, environment variables for build, file cleanup, global variable `__PMDARIMA_SETUP__` for internal signaling.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0.2\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Justification: No malicious activity, just standard setup practices.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The global variable `__PMDARIMA_SETUP__` is a common pattern to indicate setup context.\n- Environment variables like `NPY_BLAS_ORDER` are standard for build configuration.\n- Cleanup routines are typical.\n- No code injection, network activity, or malicious code observed.\n- The use of importlib to dynamically load package version is safe here.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nNo malicious activity or security risk. The report's reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Summary:**\n- Purpose: Similar to above, configuring package build.\n- Findings: Sets `builtins.__PMDARIMA_SETUP__`, no suspicious code.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0.1\n- Obfuscated: 0\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The global variable assignment is a known pattern for internal signaling.\n- No network, no code injection, no hardcoded secrets.\n- The script's complexity is typical for setup scripts.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nStandard setup code, no malicious behavior. The low risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Summary:**\n- Purpose: Package setup, version retrieval, metadata.\n- Findings: Uses `import pmdarima` to get version, sets `__PMDARIMA_SETUP__`.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0.2\n- Obfuscated: 0\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The `import pmdarima` is legitimate for version info.\n- The `__PMDARIMA_SETUP__` global variable is a common pattern.\n- No network activity or malicious code.\n- The verbose print statements are benign.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nStandard, transparent setup code. No signs of malware.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Summary:**\n- Purpose: Setup and build configuration.\n- Findings: Reads system info, sets global variable, no untrusted data sinks.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0.2\n- Obfuscated: 0\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The use of a global variable in `builtins` is unusual but not malicious.\n- No network, no data exfiltration, no malicious code.\n- The routines are typical for complex build scripts.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nNo malicious activity; just an unconventional but benign pattern.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Summary:**\n- Purpose: Setup and configuration.\n- Findings: Reads files, manages build extensions, sets a global variable.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0.1\n- Obfuscated: 0\n\n**Assessment:**\n- No suspicious code or behavior.\n- Standard package setup.\n- No malicious activity.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nPurely standard setup code, no security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Final Cross-Analysis:\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script.\n- The only \"anomalous\" pattern is setting a global variable `__PMDARIMA_SETUP__` in `builtins`, which is a known technique for internal signaling during package setup.\n- No code injection, network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present.\n- The environment variable modifications are typical for build optimization and configuration.\n- The cleanup routines are standard for build artifacts.\n\n### Scores Justification:\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** Given the absence of malicious activity, the overall risk is very low, around 0.1-0.2.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The current scores are reasonable.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, standard setup process)\n\nThis setup script is typical for Python packages and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
