  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate component of a configuration management system, with no embedded malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary concern is the invocation of external resolvers, which could be malicious if untrusted, but this is a standard plugin pattern. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.2)."
