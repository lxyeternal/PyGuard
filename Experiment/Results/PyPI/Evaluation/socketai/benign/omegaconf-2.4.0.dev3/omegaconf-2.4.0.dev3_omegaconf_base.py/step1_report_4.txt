  "purpose": "The code defines abstract and concrete classes for configuration nodes and containers in a hierarchical configuration system, including mechanisms for interpolation, validation, and type handling.",
  "sources": "Reads include class initializers, method calls for validation, parsing of parse trees, and attribute access; specifically, functions like _get_value, parse(), and various attribute getters.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include _format_and_raise() which raises exceptions, and custom resolver invocations via _evaluate_custom_resolver(), which could execute untrusted resolver code. Also, the _invalidate_flags_cache() method propagates cache invalidation down the tree.",
  "flows": "Sources such as parse_tree outputs and _get_value are used in interpolation resolution and validation, flowing into _resolve_interpolation_from_parse_tree and _validate_and_convert_interpolation_result, which may trigger custom resolvers or validation errors. Exception handling in _resolve_node_interpolation and resolve_parse_tree indicates control flow based on resolution success.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors are evident. The code relies on external functions and modules for core logic, but the code itself does not perform network operations, file I/O, or system modifications. Usage of __deepcopy__ and cache invalidation suggests complexity but not malicious intent. The dynamic invocation of resolvers could be risky if resolvers are untrusted, but this is standard for plugin architectures.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily implements a configuration node hierarchy with methods for interpolation, validation, and resolution. It uses exception handling and recursive resolution patterns consistent with configuration systems. The presence of dynamic resolver invocation in _evaluate_custom_resolver() could be a concern if external resolvers are untrusted, but this pattern is typical for extendable plugin systems. No code in this snippet performs network access, system modification, or data exfiltration. The use of parse trees and validation functions suggests proper handling of input data, but the reliance on external resolver functions may pose a risk if those are malicious or compromised. Overall, the code appears to be a standard implementation of a configuration system without embedded malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a complex configuration node management implementation with mechanisms for interpolation and validation. No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or unauthorized data access is present within this snippet. The only potential security concern relates to the dynamic resolver invocation, which could execute malicious code if external resolvers are compromised, but this is an architectural risk inherent in plugin systems rather than malicious code itself.",
