{
  "purpose": "Establishes a namespace package by declaring it, enabling the package to be split across multiple distributions.",
  "sources": "The code reads the special variable __name__, and attempts to import 'pkg_resources' to declare the namespace.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "The flow is from importing 'pkg_resources' to calling 'declare_namespace', which affects package namespace handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a dynamic import and fallback mechanism, which is common but can sometimes obscure malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import 'pkg_resources' to declare a namespace for the current package. If 'pkg_resources' is not available, it falls back to 'pkgutil' to extend the package's __path__, facilitating namespace packages. This pattern is standard for namespace package setup and does not involve data processing or malicious actions. There are no obfuscated parts or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard namespace package declaration snippet. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It simply manages package namespace setup.",
