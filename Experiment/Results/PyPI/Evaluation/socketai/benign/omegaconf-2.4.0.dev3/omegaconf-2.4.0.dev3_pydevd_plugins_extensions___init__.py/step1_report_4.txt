{
  "purpose": "Declare a namespace package to allow multiple distributions to extend the same namespace.",
  "sources": "The code imports __import__('pkg_resources') and calls declare_namespace(__name__).",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling; no external data or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only modifies package namespace configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of __import__('pkg_resources') in this context is common for namespace packages; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to declare a namespace package by importing 'pkg_resources' dynamically, then calling declare_namespace. If 'pkg_resources' is unavailable, it falls back to 'pkgutil' to extend the package path. Both are standard practices for supporting namespace packages. No suspicious or malicious actions are evident. The code does not perform any network, file, or environment variable operations, nor does it handle untrusted input.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements standard namespace package declaration logic, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is typical for package setup and management. No malware or security issues detected.",
