  "purpose": "Establishes a namespace package in Python, using either pkg_resources or pkgutil fallback.",
  "sources": "Import statements for pkg_resources and pkgutil, and the __path__ variable.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "Importing modules and setting __path__; no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard namespace package pattern with fallback.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to declare a namespace package by importing pkg_resources to call declare_namespace(__name__). If pkg_resources is unavailable, it falls back to extending __path__ with pkgutil.extend_path. Both mechanisms are common in Python packaging. No untrusted input, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The code is straightforward, with no suspicious behavior or hardcoded secrets. The fallback mechanism is standard and does not introduce security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign pattern for namespace package declaration in Python. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behavior is present. The scores are justified and should remain at zero for malware and obfuscation, with a minimal risk score (~0.1) due to fallback mechanisms, which are standard practice.",
