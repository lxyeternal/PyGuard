{
  "purpose": "The code aims to declare a namespace package, enabling the package to be split across multiple distributions.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's __name__ and __path__ variables, and attempts to import 'pkg_resources' or 'pkgutil'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could cause data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "The code uses __name__ to declare a namespace; depending on import success, it modifies __path__ via 'pkgutil.extend_path'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code uses standard namespace package declaration patterns with common libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to declare a namespace package using '__import__('pkg_resources')'. If 'pkg_resources' is unavailable, it falls back to 'pkgutil.extend_path' to manage '__path__'. Both are standard methods for namespace packages. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscation. The code's structure aligns with typical namespace package implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace package declaration pattern with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
