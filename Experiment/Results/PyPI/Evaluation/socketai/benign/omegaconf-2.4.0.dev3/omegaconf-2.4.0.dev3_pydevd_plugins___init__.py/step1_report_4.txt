{
  "purpose": "The code sets up namespace declaration for a Python package, allowing multiple distribution packages to share the same namespace.",
  "sources": "Import statements (__import__('pkg_resources').declare_namespace(__name__)) and fallback extension (__path__ = pkgutil.extend_path(__path__, __name__))",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive actions",
  "flows": "Import of pkg_resources to declare namespace, fallback to pkgutil.extend_path to handle namespace path extension",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code uses standard namespace declaration techniques without unusual or hidden behavior",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to declare a namespace using pkg_resources. If that fails due to ImportError, it falls back to extending the __path__ with pkgutil. Both are common practices for namespace packages. No data input, network access, or sensitive operations are involved. There are no hardcoded credentials, malicious behavior, or obfuscated code present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard pattern for supporting namespace packages and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks.",
