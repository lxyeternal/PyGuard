  "purpose": "Declare a namespace package in Python, attempting to use pkg_resources' declare_namespace, with a fallback to pkgutil.extend_path.",
  "sources": "Import of __import__('pkg_resources') and fallback import of pkgutil; modification of __path__ variable.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external output.",
  "flows": "Attempt to import pkg_resources and call declare_namespace(__name__); if ImportError, extend __path__ with pkgutil.extend_path(__path__, __name__).",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import and modification of __path__, but this is a standard pattern for namespace packages, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-known pattern for defining namespace packages in Python. It attempts to declare a namespace using pkg_resources, falling back to pkgutil if necessary. No untrusted input, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The pattern is standard and safe. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code are detected. The fallback mechanism is a common practice in namespace package setup. The code's simplicity and adherence to known patterns indicate no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation for declaring namespace packages in Python. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores should reflect zero malware, no obfuscation, and minimal security risk.",
