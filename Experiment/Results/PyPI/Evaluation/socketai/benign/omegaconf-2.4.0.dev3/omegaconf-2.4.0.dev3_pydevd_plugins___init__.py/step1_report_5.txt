{
  "purpose": "This code is used to declare a namespace package in Python, allowing the package to be split across multiple directories or distributions.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's __name__ and attempts to import 'pkg_resources' or 'pkgutil' to extend the package path.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that could lead to data leaks or security issues; no untrusted data is used in a dangerous way.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing modules based on availability, but it does not process or handle untrusted input data.",
  "anomalies": "The use of __import__ with a string and fallback to extend_path are standard practices for namespace packages, with no unusual or suspicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to declare a namespace package by importing 'pkg_resources' and calling declare_namespace. If 'pkg_resources' is unavailable, it falls back to using 'pkgutil' to extend the package's __path__, enabling namespace package functionality. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious code injection. The structure is typical for supporting namespace packages in Python.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for namespace package declaration, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It functions solely to enable namespace distribution of packages.",
