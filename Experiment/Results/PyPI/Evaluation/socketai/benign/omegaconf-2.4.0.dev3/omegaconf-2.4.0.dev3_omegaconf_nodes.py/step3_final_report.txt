{
  "purpose": "The code defines configuration node classes with validation, copying, and type enforcement, serving as part of a configuration management system.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in constructors and methods, such as 'value', 'key', and 'flags'; internal attributes like '_val' and '_metadata'.",
  "sinks": "Internal validation and conversion functions; no external data transmission or system interaction observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input values through validation and conversion methods to internal storage; no external system or network flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or backdoors identified; code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code implements various configuration node classes with validation, type enforcement, deep copying, and error handling. It operates solely on provided data, with no network, file, or environment variable access. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are present. Validation logic is standard, and the code uses abstract methods for extensibility. No suspicious data flows or external side effects are detected, indicating benign behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, well-structured configuration management implementation with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The high malware and obfuscation scores are justified as zero, and the overall security risk is minimal (~0.1), reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
