  "purpose": "Manage Python version compatibility for importing TypeAlias and define a type alias for ParserRuleContext to facilitate type hinting without mypy errors.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, the local vendor.antlr4.ParserRuleContext module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, output, or external communication points",
  "flows": "Conditional import based on Python version, then assignment of ParserRuleContext to a type alias",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward version check and type aliasing with explanatory comments",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports TypeAlias depending on Python version, then creates a type alias for ParserRuleContext from a vendor package to improve type hinting. It contains no dynamic code execution, no data handling, and no suspicious patterns. Comments clarify the purpose, and the implementation aligns with standard compatibility practices. No security issues, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for cross-version type hinting compatibility, with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals and reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and risk score of 0, which are appropriate given its straightforward, well-documented nature.",
