{
  "purpose": "This code manages type hinting for the ANTLR4 `ParserRuleContext` class, providing compatibility for different Python versions and creating a type alias for type checking purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports from `sys`, `typing`, `typing_extensions`, and a relative import from `vendor.antlr4.ParserRuleContext`.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process untrusted input or produce outputs.",
  "flows": "Imports and type aliasing flow from imported modules to usage in type annotations; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code includes comments explaining the purpose of type aliasing and version handling.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward compatibility handling for Python version differences in importing `TypeAlias` and creates a type alias for `ParserRuleContext`. It avoids unsafe dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic. The comments clarify the purpose and do not indicate malicious intent. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for managing type annotations across Python versions with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
