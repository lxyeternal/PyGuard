{
  "purpose": "To provide a type alias for the ANTLR4 parser rule context class for type hinting purposes, ensuring compatibility across Python versions.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, and a relative import of ParserRuleContext from a vendor package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, input/output, or external data flow present.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a comment explaining the reason for creating a type alias and handles version compatibility. No suspicious or malicious code behaviors are evident. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages imports and type aliasing for compatibility and type hinting. It includes version checking for Python compatibility, a standard import from a vendor package, and a type alias declaration with a comment explaining its purpose. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or malicious behaviors. The code appears to be a straightforward module setup for type annotations with no external communications or side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility and type hinting setup with no malicious or security issues detected. It does not perform any risky operations or contain suspicious behavior. The use of comments suggests clarity of purpose, and there are no indicators of malware or security risks.",
