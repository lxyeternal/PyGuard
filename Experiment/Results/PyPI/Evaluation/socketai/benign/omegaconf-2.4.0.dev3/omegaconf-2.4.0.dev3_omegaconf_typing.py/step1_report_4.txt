{
  "purpose": "This code manages compatibility for importing TypeAlias from different modules based on Python version and defines a type alias for an ANTLR4 parser context class for type hinting purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Python version info from sys.version_info and imports modules accordingly. It also imports ParserRuleContext from a vendor package.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "The flow involves checking Python version, importing modules, and defining a type alias for type hinting, with no untrusted data flow involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious behavior, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code includes standard version compatibility handling and type aliasing.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly handles importing TypeAlias based on Python version, avoiding compatibility issues. It imports a class from a vendor package and creates a type alias with a comment explaining its purpose. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. The code appears purely for type hinting and compatibility purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, well-documented compatibility and type alias setup with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
