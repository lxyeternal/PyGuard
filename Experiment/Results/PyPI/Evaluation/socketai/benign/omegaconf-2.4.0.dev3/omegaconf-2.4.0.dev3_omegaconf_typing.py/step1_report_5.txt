{
  "purpose": "The code provides compatibility for importing the `TypeAlias` from the `typing` module based on Python version, and creates a type alias for an ANTLR4 parser class to facilitate type hinting in a codebase.",
  "sources": "Reading Python version info via `sys.version_info`; importing `TypeAlias` from `typing` or `typing_extensions`; importing `ParserRuleContext` from a local vendor package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output sources present; no functions or data flows involving external data.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves checking Python version, importing necessary modules, and defining a type alias. There are no data flows involving user input or external data.",
  "anomalies": "The code comments indicate an awareness of limitations of the imported class for type checking, but this is standard practice. No suspicious or unusual code patterns, backdoors, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code starts by conditionally importing `TypeAlias` depending on Python version, which is a common compatibility pattern. It then imports a class from a local vendor package. The comment explains the reasoning behind creating a type alias for the ANTLR4 class to avoid mypy errors, which is a legitimate development concern. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious code logic. All imports and operations appear benign and standard for type hinting purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility and type hinting setup for a larger project involving ANTLR4 parser classes. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The code’s purpose is purely to improve type safety and compatibility, with no signs of malicious intent.",
