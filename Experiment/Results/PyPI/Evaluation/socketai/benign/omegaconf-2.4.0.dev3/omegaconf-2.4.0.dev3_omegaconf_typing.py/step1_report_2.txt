{
  "purpose": "This code handles compatibility for importing TypeAlias from typing or typing_extensions and creates a type alias for a parser context class from an external library.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Python version info from sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output operations are present that could lead to data leaks or effect.",
  "flows": "sys.version_info is used to determine which import to perform; the imported ParserRuleContext is aliased without further processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; the comments are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code checks Python version to import typing constructs appropriately, which is standard for compatibility. It then imports a class from a vendor package and creates a type alias for it, with explanatory comments. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious operations. The code appears to be a straightforward, compatibility-focused snippet related to type hinting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical compatibility and type hinting utility without any signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It performs standard imports and aliasing with detailed comments. No security concerns are evident.",
