  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer or interface aggregator, importing various internal components and defining the public API via __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (.base, .dictconfig, .errors, etc.)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, network activity, or file I/O present",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports and exports symbols",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and an __all__ list, typical for a package's __init__.py. It does not perform any dynamic execution, network communication, or handle untrusted data. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious payloads, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All provided reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0, with high confidence. There are no logical flaws or inconsistencies. The code's purpose is purely organizational, exposing internal components for external use.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module aggregation with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports and scores are accurate and appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
