  "purpose": "Provides a thread-safe parser for interpolated configuration strings using ANTLR-generated grammars, with caching and custom error handling.",
  "sources": "Input string processed via InputStream, then through lexer, token stream, and parser; input streams are replaced on each parse call.",
  "sinks": "Parse tree output; exceptions raised on syntax errors or ambiguities.",
  "flows": "Input string -> InputStream -> Lexer -> TokenStream -> Parser -> parse tree; errors trigger exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "Uses thread-local cache for performance; regex pattern for interpolation is complex but carefully constructed; no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured parser component employing thread-safe caching, precise regex for interpolation detection, and robust error handling. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The regex pattern is designed to avoid false positives. Error handling converts ANTLR errors into custom exceptions, which is standard. The caching mechanism is appropriate and correctly implemented.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure parser for configuration strings with interpolation syntax. No signs of malicious intent, malware, or obfuscation are present. The overall security risk is very low. The current scores should be: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2–0.3.",
