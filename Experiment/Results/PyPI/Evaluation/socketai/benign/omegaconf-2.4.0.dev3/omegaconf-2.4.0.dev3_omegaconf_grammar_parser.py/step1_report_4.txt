{
  "purpose": "This module provides functions and classes for parsing interpolated configuration strings using ANTLR4-generated grammars, with thread-safe caching of parser instances and custom error handling.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the 'value' parameter in the parse() function; reads and modifies thread-local cache (_grammar_cache); accesses imported grammar lexer and parser classes.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks where untrusted data flows to insecure operations are present. The code raises exceptions on parsing errors, but does not process or output sensitive data or untrusted input beyond parsing.",
  "flows": "Input string is read from the 'value' parameter; input stream is created; parser cache is checked or initialized; parser and lexer are configured; parse() invokes specific parser rule; exceptions are raised if errors occur.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses thread-local caching for parser objects, which is normal; no hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious dynamic code execution are present. The regex pattern is complex but appears standard for matching interpolations. No obfuscated or suspicious language features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily facilitates parsing of configuration strings with interpolations via ANTLR4. It caches parser instances per thread for efficiency and uses a custom error listener that raises exceptions on parse errors. No malicious code or backdoors are evident. The regex pattern correctly identifies interpolation patterns, and error handling converts ANTLR errors into custom exceptions. The code does not process or leak data, nor does it perform network operations or system modifications. It operates purely within parsing and error handling context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard parser setup for configuration interpolations, with thread-safe caching and custom error reporting. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are present. It is a well-structured, non-malicious code fragment designed for parsing and error handling in configuration processing.",
