{
  "purpose": "The code implements the core functionalities of the OmegaConf configuration library, including creation, loading, saving, merging, resolution, and resolver registration. It manages configuration data structures, supports interpolation, and allows user-defined resolvers for dynamic value computation.",
  "sources": "YAML files (via yaml.load), environment variables (through resolvers), input objects (dicts, lists, classes), and user-registered resolver functions.",
  "sinks": "YAML serialization (yaml.dump), file writes, and in-memory data structures. No system commands, network activity, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from YAML files or objects into internal containers; resolvers may invoke user-defined functions during interpolation; data can be serialized back to YAML or converted to Python objects.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or hidden malicious patterns detected. The resolver registration system allows external functions to be invoked, which could be malicious if misused, but this is an intended extension point.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured configuration management library with standard features such as creation, merging, serialization, and resolver registration. YAML loading depends on a loader from get_yaml_loader(), which should be safe if implemented correctly. The resolver system is flexible but controlled; malicious resolvers could execute arbitrary code if registered externally. No signs of code injection, network activity, or data leaks are present. The code does not contain obfuscation or malicious payloads. The primary potential risk stems from external resolver functions, but this is an API feature, not a flaw. Overall, the code appears safe and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, transparent configuration management library with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only potential concern is the resolver registration interface, which could be misused if malicious functions are registered externally. However, the code itself does not include such functions or backdoors. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.2), primarily due to the resolver extension point.",
