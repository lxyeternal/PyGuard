  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, transparent configuration management library with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only potential concern is the resolver registration interface, which could be misused if malicious functions are registered externally. However, the code itself does not include such functions or backdoors. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.2), primarily due to the resolver extension point."
