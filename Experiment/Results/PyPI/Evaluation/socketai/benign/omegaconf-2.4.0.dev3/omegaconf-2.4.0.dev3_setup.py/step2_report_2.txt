  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code, reasoning, and scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the script as a setup script reading requirements, README, version, and importing build helpers.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No untrusted data flows or suspicious behaviors. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate; the code is standard, with no malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk=0.1 seem reasonable given the absence of any suspicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0 is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, correctly identifies standard setup routines.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No suspicious code or external threats.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states it's a typical setup script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes reading dependencies, README, and version info.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Valid; standard packaging code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are suitable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Recognizes the script's purpose accurately.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** Mentions potential concerns about external build helpers and dynamic version fetching, but notes no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Reasonable; external build helpers could be a concern if compromised, but no evidence here.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2. The securityRisk is slightly higher (0.2) to reflect that external modules (build_helpers) could be a vector if malicious, but no actual malicious activity is observed.\n\n**Verdict:** Slightly conservative but reasonable. No suspicious code detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the setup process.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No suspicious activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Valid; standard setup code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n\n- All reports correctly identify the code as standard setup scripts with no malicious activity.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the clear, readable code.\n- The securityRisk scores are low, with a slight increase (0.2) in Report 4 to account for external build helpers, which could be a potential risk if compromised, but no evidence suggests malicious intent.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk score:** Given the external dependencies and build helpers, a slightly elevated risk score (around 0.1–0.2) is justified, but overall, the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0 (no signs of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 (code is straightforward)\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (due to external build helpers and dynamic version fetching, but no actual malicious activity)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears to be a legitimate, standard Python package setup script with no security issues or malicious intent.",
