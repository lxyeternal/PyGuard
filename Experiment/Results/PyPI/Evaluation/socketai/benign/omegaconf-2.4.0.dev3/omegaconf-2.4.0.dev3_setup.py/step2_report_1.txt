  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** No malicious code, no suspicious data flows, standard setup script.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, Risk = 0.1.  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code is typical for a setup script. The low risk score is appropriate given the absence of any suspicious activity.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as Report 1, no malicious activity, standard practices.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, Risk = 0.0.  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code's behavior. The risk score of zero aligns with the lack of any suspicious elements.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports, standard setup routines, no malicious code.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, Risk = 0.0.  \n- **Assessment:** Appropriate, given the code's straightforward nature.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Slightly more detailed, mentions external build helpers and dynamic version fetching, but no evidence of malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, Risk = 0.2.  \n- **Assessment:** The risk score is slightly higher but still low. The mention of external build helpers warrants caution, but no malicious behavior is indicated. The score seems reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to previous, standard setup, no suspicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, Risk = 0.1.  \n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code does not perform any network operations, dynamic code execution, or contain obfuscated/malicious logic.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is clear and straightforward; no obfuscation is present.  \n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the script—primarily file reads, package configuration, and standard build commands—the risk scores are appropriately low. The only slight elevation in Report 4 (0.2) accounts for external build helpers and dynamic version resolution, which could be vectors if compromised, but there's no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.  \n- The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis.  \n- No modifications are necessary; the assessments are reasonable and justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 (clear, straightforward code)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (minimal, inherent in build scripts, but no significant risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The current scores are appropriate. The code is safe, standard, and free of malicious intent.",
