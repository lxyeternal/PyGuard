  "conclusion": "The dependency shows significant signs of malicious activity and obfuscation in reports 1 and 2, warranting high malware and security risk scores. Reports 3 and 4 lack code, correctly scored as zero. Report 5 indicates benign code with low risk. Adjustments to report 2's malware and risk scores enhance consistency, but overall, the assessments are appropriate and justified."
