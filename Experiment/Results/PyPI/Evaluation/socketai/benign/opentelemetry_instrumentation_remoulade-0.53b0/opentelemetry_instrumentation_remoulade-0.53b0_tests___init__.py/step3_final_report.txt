  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, network connections, subprocess calls, hardcoded strings, dynamic code execution (eval, exec).",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file writes, environment variables, subprocess executions.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables and code inputs flow into network communication, dynamic execution, or data exfiltration points.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec, obfuscated variable names, hardcoded URLs/IPs, suspicious network activity, dynamic code execution, redundant or convoluted code.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation, dynamic execution, and suspicious network activity, indicating potential malicious intent. High confidence in malicious behavior is justified where such signs are present. No code or benign code is provided in some reports, which is appropriately reflected in their scores. Slight score adjustments for report 2's malware (to 0.7) and risk (to 0.7) improve consistency with the severity of behaviors described. Overall, the scores align well with the described behaviors and indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows significant signs of malicious activity and obfuscation in reports 1 and 2, warranting high malware and security risk scores. Reports 3 and 4 lack code, correctly scored as zero. Report 5 indicates benign code with low risk. Adjustments to report 2's malware and risk scores enhance consistency, but overall, the assessments are appropriate and justified.",
