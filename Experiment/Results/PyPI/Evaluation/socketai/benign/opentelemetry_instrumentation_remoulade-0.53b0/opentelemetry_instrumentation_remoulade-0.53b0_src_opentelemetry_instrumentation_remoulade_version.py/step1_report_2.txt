  "purpose": "The code appears to set the version of the package, likely for use within a larger open-source project or library.",
  "sources": "The only source of data is the assignment of the __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data could be exploited or cause harm.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources or external inputs.",
  "anomalies": "The code is purely a license and version declaration with no malicious or unusual behavior; the license comments are standard, and the version string is static.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, consisting of license comments and a single version string assignment. It contains no input handling, external data fetching, or complex logic. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior. The content is typical for open-source projects to specify licensing and version info.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, only setting a version identifier with accompanying license comments. No malicious activity, security risks, or anomalies are present.",
