  "purpose": "This code snippet serves as a header comment block with licensing information and assigns a static version string to __version__.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from licensing comments and the static assignment of __version__.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any actions that could lead to data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static metadata only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code are present; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only licensing comments and a static version assignment, with no functions, data processing, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code content. The code is a typical open-source header with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static header with licensing and version information. There are no security concerns, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation present. The reports are accurate and the scores appropriate.",
