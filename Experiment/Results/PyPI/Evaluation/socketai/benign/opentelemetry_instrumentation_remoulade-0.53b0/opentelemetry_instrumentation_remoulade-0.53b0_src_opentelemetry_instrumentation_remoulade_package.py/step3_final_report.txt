  "purpose": "Dependency declaration for the 'remoulade' package with version constraint >= 0.50.",
  "sources": "Static string within a tuple assigned to '_instruments'. No external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external sinks; the code only assigns a string to a variable.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; straightforward dependency declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static tuple assignment of a dependency string, with standard license headers. No dynamic code, input/output, network activity, or obfuscation present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent and appropriate given the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign dependency declaration with no security concerns or malicious behavior. The existing reports and scores are accurate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
