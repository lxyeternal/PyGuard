  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: a simple assignment of a tuple containing a version requirement string to a variable.\n- The code is static, with no dynamic execution, external inputs, or outputs.\n- The license header and comments are standard and do not influence behavior.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are detected.\n- All reports assign a benign dependency declaration.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code is straightforward and matches the original code snippet.\n   - No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are present.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify the code as benign and standard for dependency declaration.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`.\n   - These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which is reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - No issues warrant a higher risk score.\n   - The code is purely declarative, with no malicious or risky behavior.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The malware score is correctly set to 0 in all reports.\n   - No malicious activity is suggested or detectable.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions.\n   - They base their conclusions on the code's simplicity and static nature.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's benign nature.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\nGiven the evidence, I agree with the reports' assessments. The code is a standard dependency declaration with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Estimated Score |\n|----------------|-----------------|\n| Malware        | 0               |\n| Obfuscated     | 0               |\n| Security Risk  | 0               |\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll reports are accurate, and no changes are necessary. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately.",
