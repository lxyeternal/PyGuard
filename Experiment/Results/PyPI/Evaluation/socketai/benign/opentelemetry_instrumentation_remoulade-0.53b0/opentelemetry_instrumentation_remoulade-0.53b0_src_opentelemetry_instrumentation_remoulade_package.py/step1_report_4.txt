  "purpose": "Declare a tuple containing a dependency requirement string for the 'remoulade' package.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources; the code defines a static variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths; code is static declaration only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard for dependency declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple assignment of a tuple with a version specification string. It does not execute any dynamic code, import modules, or perform any network or file operations. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious patterns. The code appears to be part of a dependency list or configuration setup, with no malicious intent or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only a static dependency declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
