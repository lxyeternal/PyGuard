  "purpose": "Instrumentation middleware for RabbitMQ message processing, managing OpenTelemetry spans during message handling and enqueueing, including context extraction and injection.",
  "sources": "Reads message.options, message.message_id, message.actor_name, and message.options['trace_ctx'].",
  "sinks": "Injects trace context into message.options; sets span attributes; manages span lifecycle.",
  "flows": "Extracts trace context from message.options, creates spans, attaches spans to message IDs, injects context during enqueue, and ends spans after processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard OpenTelemetry instrumentation for message brokers, managing span creation, context propagation, and lifecycle. It uses well-established APIs and patterns, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The purpose is solely for observability. The code is clear, well-structured, and adheres to best practices. No suspicious signals or anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate OpenTelemetry middleware for RabbitMQ, with no malicious intent or suspicious activity. It serves to enable distributed tracing and observability, with scores consistent with benign telemetry code.",
