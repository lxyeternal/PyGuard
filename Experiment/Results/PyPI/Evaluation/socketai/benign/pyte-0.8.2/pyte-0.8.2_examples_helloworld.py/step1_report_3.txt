{
  "purpose": "The code initializes a pyte screen and stream, feeds a string 'Hello World!' into the stream, and displays the resulting screen content.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings within the script ('Hello World!') and the 'screen.display' attribute.",
  "sinks": "The output is printed to standard output via the print() function; no untrusted data or external sinks are involved.",
  "flows": "The script feeds a hardcoded string into the pyte stream, which updates the screen object, then displays the screen content.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed. The code uses a standard library 'pyte' without any obfuscation or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'pyte' library, creates a screen and stream, feeds a static message, and prints the screen contents. No external data sources, user input, or untrusted data handling is present. The code's functionality is straightforward and consistent with its purpose of demonstrating 'pyte' usage. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple example demonstrating 'pyte' library functionality. It contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is safe for use and review.",
