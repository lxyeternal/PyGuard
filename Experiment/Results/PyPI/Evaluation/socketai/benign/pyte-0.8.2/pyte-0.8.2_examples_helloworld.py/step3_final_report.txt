{
  "purpose": "Demonstrates basic usage of the pyte library to create a terminal screen, feed a string, and display output.",
  "sources": "Static string 'Hello World!' fed into pyte.Stream via stream.feed()",
  "sinks": "Display output via print; no untrusted data sources or external inputs involved",
  "flows": "stream.feed('Hello World!') → screen.display → print output",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward, static code with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code imports pyte, initializes a Screen and Stream, feeds a static string, and prints the display lines. No external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution occurs. The code is minimal, intended for demonstration, and uses no sensitive data or obfuscation. All indicators point to benign behavior. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are justified given the simplicity and static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, minimal demonstration of pyte usage with no malicious intent or security risks. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
