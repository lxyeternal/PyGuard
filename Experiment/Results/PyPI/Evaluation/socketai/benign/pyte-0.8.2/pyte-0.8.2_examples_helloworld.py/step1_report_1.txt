{
  "purpose": "To demonstrate a minimal example of using the pyte library to create a terminal screen and display text.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from a hardcoded string fed into the pyte.Stream object.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs to standard output using print(), which is generally considered safe and does not handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The feed() method passes a static string 'Hello World!' from source (hardcoded input) to the pyte stream, which updates the screen object, then the display property is read and printed.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. The code only uses the pyte library for display simulation and standard output.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a third-party library, pyte, to simulate terminal behavior. It creates a screen and stream, feeds a static string into the stream, and then prints the resulting display lines. No external input, network communication, or sensitive data handling is present. The code is straightforward, minimal, and appears intended for demonstration purposes without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple demonstration script utilizing pyte for terminal emulation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code is benign and safe.",
