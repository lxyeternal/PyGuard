{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for verifying the output of a terminal emulator library (pyte) using pre-captured input and expected output files.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from files in the 'captured' directory, specifically files with '.input' extensions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; the code only reads files and loads JSON data without executing or passing data to external systems.",
  "flows": "Reads input files -> feeds data into pyte ByteStream -> compares the emulator's display state with expected output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Usage of standard libraries and a well-known testing framework (pytest).",
  "analysis": "The code loads input and expected output files for testing, then uses the pyte library to process the input and verify the terminal display matches expectations. There are no suspicious network activities, data leaks, or malicious code injections. The code performs straightforward file reading, data processing, and assertion checks typical of a test suite.",
  "conclusion": "This appears to be a benign test script for verifying terminal emulator behavior with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
