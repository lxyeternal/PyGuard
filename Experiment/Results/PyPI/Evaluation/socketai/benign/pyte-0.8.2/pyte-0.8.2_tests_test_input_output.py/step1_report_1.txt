{
  "purpose": "The code is a test script that reads input data from files, feeds it into a pyte screen emulator, and compares the screen output to expected output data to verify the behavior of the pyte library.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from files in the 'captured' directory using open() in binary mode; reading JSON output files.",
  "sinks": "None directly; no data is sent over the network, written to sensitive locations, or executed.",
  "flows": "Input data read from files is fed into pyte.ByteStream, which updates the pyte.Screen object; the output display is then compared to expected data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. Usage of standard libraries and test annotations is typical.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and third-party libraries, defines a directory for input data, and runs parameterized tests by reading input and expected output files. It uses pyte to emulate terminal output. There are no dynamic code executions, network activities, or security-sensitive operations. The code appears to be straightforward testing logic for the pyte library with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test suite for verifying terminal emulation behavior. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are identified. It is safe and contains no suspicious elements.",
