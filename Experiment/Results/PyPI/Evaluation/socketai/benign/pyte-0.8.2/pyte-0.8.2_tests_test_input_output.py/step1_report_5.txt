{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to test the output of the 'pyte' terminal emulator library against predefined expected outputs.",
  "sources": "File reads from 'captured' directory for input and output data, specifically reading input binary files and output JSON files.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data execution or data leakage; it only loads data from files and processes them with pyte.",
  "flows": "Reads input files -> Feeds data into pyte stream -> Compares terminal display output with expected output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated code or hidden behaviors. Use of external library 'pyte' is standard for terminal emulation testing.",
  "analysis": "The code loads input binary data from files, processes it with the pyte library, and compares the resulting terminal display with expected output loaded from JSON files. No external or untrusted data manipulation occurs beyond file reading. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code appears to be a straightforward test setup for terminal output validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test script for validating terminal emulator behavior using predefined input/output data. No malicious or suspicious activities are evident. It operates securely within its testing scope.",
