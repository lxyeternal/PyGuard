{
  "purpose": "A test suite that reads input files, feeds data into the pyte terminal emulator, and compares the output to expected results.",
  "sources": "File reads from the 'captured' directory, reading input data and expected output JSON files.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; data is only read from local files and processed internally.",
  "flows": "Input data read from files flows into pyte.ByteStream.feed(), then the terminal display is compared to expected output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward file I/O, no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, no network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard testing procedures: reading input files, feeding data into pyte, and asserting the display matches expected output. No suspicious patterns, malicious code, or obfuscation are present. The code uses standard libraries and well-known testing practices. No external network activity, dynamic code execution, or handling of sensitive data occurs. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 in one report is unjustified; the code's operations are entirely local and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward test suite with no malicious, obfuscated, or security vulnerabilities. All scores should be set to 0, as there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risk.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
