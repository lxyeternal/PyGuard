{
  "purpose": "This code tests the input-output behavior of the pyte terminal emulator library by feeding it test data and comparing the resulting screen display to expected output.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from files in the 'captured' directory using 'open' and 'read'.",
  "sinks": "The code loads expected output data from JSON files using 'json.load'. No untrusted data appears to be written or transmitted elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Input files are read and fed into 'pyte.ByteStream'; the output from 'pyte.Screen.display' is compared to expected output from the JSON files.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code detected. Usage of standard libraries and straightforward data handling.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and 'pyte'. It constructs file paths relative to the current file, reads binary input data, and loads expected output data from JSON files. It then initializes a 'pyte' screen and stream, feeds the input, and asserts the display matches expected output. All operations are standard testing procedures without suspicious behavior. No secrets, network activity, or code injection mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a straightforward test of the 'pyte' library's functionality, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe and typical for testing purposes.",
