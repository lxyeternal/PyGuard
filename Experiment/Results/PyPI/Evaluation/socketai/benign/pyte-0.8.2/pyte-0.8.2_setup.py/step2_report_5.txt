  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code, its logic, and the scoring.\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard setup script for a Python package.\n- The code performs typical operations: importing modules, reading a README file, defining metadata, and calling `setup()`.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted data handling is present.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The only potential concern noted is a very low security risk score (0.1) in report 3, which is still minimal.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior, no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Verdict:** Fully consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same as Report 1, standard setup script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to others, but notes a securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Analysis:** Given the code's simplicity, the minimal security risk score seems to be a conservative placeholder, possibly acknowledging that reading static files is generally safe but could, in theory, be a vector if the file content were malicious. However, since the file is static and not processed dynamically, this is negligible.\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 is acceptable but could be adjusted to 0, as no actual risk exists.\n- **Verdict:** No issues; the score is slightly conservative but not unreasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4 & 5**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, standard setup scripts.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Conclusion:**\n\n- **Code presence:** No, the code is a standard setup script.\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** All appropriately low; no real security risks.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Judgment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks; reading static files and calling setup is safe)\n\n**Note:** The slight security risk score of 0.1 in report 3 could be lowered to 0 for consistency, as the code does not process untrusted input or perform any risky operations.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\nThis is a benign, standard package setup script with no security concerns.",
