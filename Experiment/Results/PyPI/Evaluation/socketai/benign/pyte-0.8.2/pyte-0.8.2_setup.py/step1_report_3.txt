{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for the 'pyte' terminal emulator package, used to package and distribute the project.",
  "sources": "Reads from the local file system: 'README' file for long description, package metadata like author and email, and package data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input data; no network or system command execution.",
  "flows": "The code reads static files and metadata, then passes data into setup() without processing untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or obfuscated code, no hardcoded credentials beyond author info, no dynamic code execution or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports 'os' and 'setuptools', reads a README file for the long description, and calls setup() with package metadata. No user input, network operations, or executable code is present. The author information and package details are static and typical for package setup scripts. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This script appears to be a standard Python package setup file with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It performs typical package configuration tasks without processing untrusted data or executing external commands.",
