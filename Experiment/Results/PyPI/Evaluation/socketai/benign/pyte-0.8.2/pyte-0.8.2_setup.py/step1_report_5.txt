{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'pyte' terminal emulator package, used to configure and install the package and its metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads README file for long description, reads package data, and imports standard libraries.",
  "sinks": "None that lead to potential data leaks or execution of untrusted data; no user input or external data processing beyond package metadata.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup procedures: importing modules, reading a README file, defining package metadata, and invoking setuptools.setup(). There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no code execution based on external data, and no network activity. The only file read is a README file, which is a common practice for long descriptions. No potentially malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script for package distribution with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
