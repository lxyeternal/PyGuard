  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'pyte' terminal emulator package, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README file for long description; static metadata for package info; importing standard libraries.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or execution points present.",
  "flows": "Reading README file (source) to assign LONG_DESCRIPTION; static data flow to setup() function parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup tasks: importing modules, reading a README file for description, defining package metadata, and calling setup(). All actions involve static data and standard library functions. No user input, network calls, or dynamic code execution observed. The code aligns with common setup script patterns, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python package setup script with no malicious behavior, supply chain risks, or security concerns detected.",
