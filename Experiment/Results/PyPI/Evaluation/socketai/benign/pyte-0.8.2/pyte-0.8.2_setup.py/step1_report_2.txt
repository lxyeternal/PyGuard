{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for the Python package 'pyte', including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "File reading for 'README' file; import statements; package setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that lead to data leakage, code execution, or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README' -> setting package metadata -> calling setup() with parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. No hardcoded credentials or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup procedures: reading a README file, defining package metadata, dependencies, and calling setuptools.setup(). All operations are typical for package configuration. No external data is dynamically fetched or processed in an insecure manner. The code does not contain any code injection, system command execution, or network activity. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It appears to be a benign configuration file for packaging.",
