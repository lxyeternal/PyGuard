  "purpose": "Terminal output capture utility that forks a process, executes a command, and records its output to a file.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for input parameters; os.execvpe for command execution; os.read from master_fd for output data.",
  "sinks": "Writing captured data to the specified output file handle.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> fork process -> execute command -> read output from master_fd -> write to file.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code spawns a subprocess in a pseudo-terminal, executes a user-specified command, captures its output in real-time, and writes it to a file. It handles process termination and signals appropriately. The modules used are standard and correctly employed. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident; the code performs a legitimate terminal session recording function.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for capturing terminal output. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
