  "purpose": "Capture output from a running terminal application and save it to a specified file.",
  "sources": "Reading command-line arguments (sys.argv), reading from the pty master file descriptor (os.read), and handling signals.",
  "sinks": "Writing captured data to a file handle (handle.write), sending SIGTERM to the child process (os.kill).",
  "flows": "Command-line input -> Forks a pseudoterminal -> Executes a command in the child -> Reads output from master_fd -> Writes output to file -> Sends termination signal to child process.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears straightforward; no hardcoded credentials, suspicious system calls, or obfuscated logic. Uses standard modules for terminal capture.",
  "analysis": "The script accepts an output file path and a command with arguments via command-line arguments. It forks a pseudoterminal to run the specified command, capturing its output. The main loop reads data from the pseudoterminal and writes it to the output file, terminating on EOF or interruption. It then sends a SIGTERM to the child process. The code's logic is consistent with terminal output capturing, with no signs of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. No suspicious network activity, credential handling, or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate terminal output capture utility with no malicious intent. It securely handles subprocess execution and data collection without evident security risks.",
