  "purpose": "Capture output from a running terminal application and save it to a specified file.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for input arguments, os.read for reading data from the pseudo-terminal master_fd.",
  "sinks": "write to output_path file, os.read from master_fd, os.execvpe to run external commands, os.kill to terminate the child process.",
  "flows": "Input arguments (sys.argv) -> pty.fork() -> os.execvpe() (executes command) -> reading data from master_fd -> writing data to file -> terminating process with os.kill.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious commands, or unusual code behaviors are present. The code performs standard terminal output capturing.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard Python modules to spawn a subprocess with a pseudo-terminal, captures its output, and writes it to a file. It handles signals and process termination gracefully. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior. The code's functionality is to monitor and record terminal output, which is a legitimate activity. No obfuscation, suspicious network activity, or secret data handling is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for capturing terminal output. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks based on its content. It performs expected operations without suspicious side effects.",
