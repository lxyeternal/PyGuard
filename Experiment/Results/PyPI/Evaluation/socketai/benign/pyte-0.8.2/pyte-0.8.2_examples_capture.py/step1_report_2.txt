  "purpose": "Capture output from a terminal application and save it to a specified file.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv), and reads data from the pseudo-terminal master file descriptor (master_fd).",
  "sinks": "Writes captured data to a file specified by output_path, and terminates the child process using os.kill with SIGTERM.",
  "flows": "Command-line args -> forked child executes command -> parent reads data from master_fd -> writes to output file -> terminates child process.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or backdoors observed. The code simply captures terminal output; no obfuscated code or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by parsing command-line arguments for output file and command to run. It forks a child process that executes the command with specific environment variables. The parent process reads data from the pseudo-terminal master file descriptor in a loop, saving output to a file. It handles interruptions gracefully and terminates the child process upon completion. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious commands are present. The use of standard libraries and straightforward logic indicates no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility to capture terminal output; it does not contain malware or malicious behavior. It appears safe with no security concerns identified.",
