{
  "purpose": "The script runs a terminal command in a pseudo-terminal environment, captures the terminal output, and displays it using the pyte library.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments for the command to execute; reads data from the pseudo-terminal master file descriptor.",
  "sinks": "Feeds data into pyte's ByteStream for processing; executes external commands via os.execvpe; sends SIGTERM to child process.",
  "flows": "Command-line input -> os.execvpe executes command -> pty.fork creates pseudo-terminal -> data read from master_fd -> feed into pyte stream -> output display.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. Uses environment variables appropriately. No suspicious or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a pseudo-terminal, runs a user-specified command, and captures the output for display. It handles signals and keyboard interrupts properly. No indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity are present. The code leverages standard libraries and follows normal patterns for terminal process management. No obfuscation or malicious logic is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign utility for terminal interaction and output capture. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks identified based on the code provided.",
