  "purpose": "This script runs an arbitrary command provided via command-line arguments, creates a pseudo-terminal, feeds the command's output into pyte's ByteStream for terminal emulation, and displays the terminal output. It handles process termination gracefully and uses standard libraries without obfuscation.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (reads command-line arguments), os.execvpe (executes command), os.read (reads data from pseudo-terminal master fd)",
  "sinks": "os.read (reads data from pseudo-terminal), pyte.ByteStream.feed (processes terminal output), print (displays terminal screen)",
  "flows": "Command-line input -> os.execvpe (child process) -> pseudo-terminal master fd -> os.read -> pyte.ByteStream.feed -> screen.display -> print",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, network activity, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code executes a user-specified command in a pseudo-terminal, captures its output, feeds it into pyte for terminal emulation, and displays the result. It handles signals and process termination properly. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection are present. The code is straightforward and uses standard libraries, with no obfuscation. The only potential risk stems from executing arbitrary commands, which is inherent to such utilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risk but acknowledging potential misuse.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign terminal emulation utility that runs arbitrary commands and displays their output. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present. The risk is low, primarily due to the execution of arbitrary commands, which is typical for such tools. The scores assigned in the reports are justified; a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a low security risk score (~0.1) are appropriate.",
