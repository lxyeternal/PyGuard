  "conclusion": "The code is a benign terminal emulation utility that runs arbitrary commands and displays their output. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present. The risk is low, primarily due to the execution of arbitrary commands, which is typical for such tools. The scores assigned in the reports are justified; a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a low security risk score (~0.1) are appropriate."
