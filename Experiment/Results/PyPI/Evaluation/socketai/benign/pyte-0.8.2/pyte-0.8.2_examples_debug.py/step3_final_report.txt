  "purpose": "Processing a static dump of terminal escape sequences for debugging purposes.",
  "sources": "A large static byte string containing terminal escape sequences.",
  "sinks": "Feeds data into pyte's ByteStream for in-memory processing; no external data or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the static blob into pyte's ByteStream via the feed() method, processed internally.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, embedded secrets, or obfuscation detected; purely static, benign data.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pyte, defines a large static byte string with terminal escape sequences, creates a ByteStream with a DebugScreen, and feeds the blob into it. No external inputs, network activity, or system modifications are present. The data appears to be a terminal output dump used for debugging. The code uses standard pyte classes correctly, with no obfuscation or malicious code. All signals indicate benign, diagnostic functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign terminal debugging utility with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its purpose and assign low malware and obfuscation scores. The overall security risk is negligible, best represented as 0.0.",
