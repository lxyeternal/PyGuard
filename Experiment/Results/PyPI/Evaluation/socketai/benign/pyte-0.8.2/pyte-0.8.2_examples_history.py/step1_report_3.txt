{
  "purpose": "Demonstrates pagination and display of terminal screen content using the pyte library.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables via os.linesep, user input via input(), and random string generation via random_string().",
  "sinks": "Outputs to standard output using print(), reads user input via input().",
  "flows": "Random strings are fed into the pyte stream, which updates the screen buffer, then the screen content is displayed, and user input controls pagination.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets or credentials. Usage of random string generation appears for demo purposes only. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns. No network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily demonstrates terminal screen manipulation and pagination. It imports standard libraries and the pyte library for terminal emulation. Random strings are generated to simulate terminal output. User prompts are used to control pagination. There are no external data sources, network communications, or system modifications. The code's behavior aligns with a benign demonstration of the pyte library's features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign demonstration script for terminal pagination, with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks observed.",
