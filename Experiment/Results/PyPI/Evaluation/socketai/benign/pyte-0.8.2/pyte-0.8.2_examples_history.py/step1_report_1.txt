  "purpose": "Demonstrates how pagination works with the pyte terminal emulator library by displaying screen content and navigating pages.",
  "sources": "os.linesep, os, random, string, sys, pyte (including pyte.control.ESC, pyte.escape.RIS)",
  "sinks": "print (outputs to stdout), input (waits for user input)",
  "flows": "random_string generates input data fed into pyte stream, which updates the screen; print_screen displays the screen; user inputs trigger page navigation",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. Usage of pyte library is standard for terminal emulation; no obfuscation, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes a pyte terminal screen, fills it with random strings to simulate content, and allows navigation through pages via user input. It uses standard libraries (os, random, string, sys) in typical ways. No external network connections, no data exfiltration, no code injections, or malicious behaviors are present. All functions are straightforward and serve a demonstrative purpose. The overall structure is clear, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign demonstration of terminal pagination using pyte. It does not contain malicious behaviors, backdoors, or security risks. No anomalies or suspicious activities are detected.",
