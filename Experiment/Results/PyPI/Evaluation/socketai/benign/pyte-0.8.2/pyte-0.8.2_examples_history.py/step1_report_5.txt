  "purpose": "Demonstrates how pagination works with a terminal screen simulation using the pyte library.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the file itself; generates random strings internally; uses os and sys modules for system interactions; receives user input via input().",
  "sinks": "Outputs to standard output using print(); accepts user input via input().",
  "flows": "Generates random strings as input data for the screen, displays screen content, waits for user input to navigate pages.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors observed. Usage of random strings appears benign and intended for demonstration.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes a terminal screen simulation with pyte, feeds it randomly generated strings to mimic paginated content, and interacts with the user to navigate pages. No external network activity, no data exfiltration, and no malicious code are present. The functions and module usage are standard for demonstration purposes. The code does not perform any insecure operations or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign demonstration of terminal pagination using pyte. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It simply generates and displays random data with user interaction.",
