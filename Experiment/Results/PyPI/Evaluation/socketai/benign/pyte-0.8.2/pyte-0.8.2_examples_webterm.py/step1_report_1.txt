{
  "purpose": "The code implements a web-based terminal emulator that spawns a shell process and communicates with a client via WebSocket for real-time terminal interaction.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from WebSocket messages, environment variables during terminal creation, and process output via the pty master file descriptor.",
  "sinks": "Writes user input data to the pseudo-terminal (pty), sends terminal state updates to the client over WebSocket, and terminates the shell process on shutdown.",
  "flows": "User input from WebSocket -> pty write; pty output read -> terminal feed -> JSON dump -> WebSocket send; shutdown signals -> process termination.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Uses standard libraries and follows typical terminal emulation setup. No obfuscated code or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a web server with a WebSocket endpoint that manages a pseudo-terminal running a shell (bash by default). It forwards user input to the shell and relays the shell output back to the client. The environment variables used for the shell process are standard. The terminal state is serialized as JSON and transmitted over WebSocket. The code includes proper cleanup procedures on shutdown, closing connections and terminating the process. No evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or sabotage mechanisms. All operations align with normal terminal emulation behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a web-based terminal emulator without any signs of malicious intent or security risks. It relies on standard libraries, executes typical process management, and does not perform any suspicious actions such as network exfiltration, data theft, or hidden backdoors.",
