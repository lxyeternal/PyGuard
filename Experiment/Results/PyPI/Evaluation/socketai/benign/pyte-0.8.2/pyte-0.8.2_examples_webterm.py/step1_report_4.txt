{
  "purpose": "Implement a web-based terminal interface that communicates with a system shell process via WebSocket.",
  "sources": "Reads user input from WebSocket messages; launches a system shell process using pty; reads process output via pty master file descriptor.",
  "sinks": "Writes user commands directly to the system shell process; sends terminal state updates via WebSocket; executes system commands and terminates processes.",
  "flows": "User input received through WebSocket -> written to pty process; pty process output read and sent back through WebSocket; commands like page navigation (ESC + P/N) trigger internal terminal state changes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. Uses standard libraries and practices for terminal emulation and WebSocket communication. No obfuscated code or malicious network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a web server that provides a WebSocket endpoint (/ws) for terminal interaction. It spawns a system shell ('bash') using pty, captures process output, and forwards it to the client. User input from WebSocket is written directly to the shell process. It handles terminal pagination commands via escape sequences. There are no signs of malicious data exfiltration, backdoors, or covert channels. The process management and cleanup are handled properly. The use of standard libraries and straightforward process control indicates no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a web terminal interface safely, with no detected malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs expected operations for such a terminal application, with proper process handling and communication. No malware or malicious activity is evident.",
