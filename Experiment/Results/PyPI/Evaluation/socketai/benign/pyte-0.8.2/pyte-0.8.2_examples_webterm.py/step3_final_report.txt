{
  "purpose": "Implements a web-based terminal emulator that spawns a shell process and communicates via WebSocket, allowing remote terminal access.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from WebSocket messages, environment variables for process setup, and process output via pty file descriptor.",
  "sinks": "Writes user commands to the process via p_out.write(), and sends terminal state updates back over WebSocket.",
  "flows": "WebSocket messages (input) -> p_out.write() -> shell process; shell process output -> terminal.feed() -> JSON dump -> WebSocket (output).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or covert channels detected. Process cleanup and signal handling are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code spawns a bash shell, manages terminal state with pyte, handles WebSocket communication for input/output, and performs proper cleanup on shutdown. No malicious network activity, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The process management and environment variable usage are typical for such applications. The security implications are minimal, with no evidence of malicious intent or vulnerabilities within this module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of a web-based terminal emulator. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks based on the code review. The scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 (reflecting inherent risks of remote shell exposure, but no code-based issues).",
