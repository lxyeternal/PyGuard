  "purpose": "Configuration script for Sphinx documentation, setting theme, version handling, and source code linking.",
  "sources": "Reads from URL via urllib.request.urlopen in resolve_tag(), module attribute access during source resolution.",
  "sinks": "URL request to verify release tag, module attribute access for source code inspection, source file inspection.",
  "flows": "Checks remote URL existence for release tag; inspects modules and source files to generate links.",
  "anomalies": "Use of URL fetch during build process; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation; exception handling in place.",
  "analysis": "Standard Sphinx configuration code. Uses network request to verify remote version tag, which is common in dynamic documentation setups. Reflection is used for source linking, which is typical. No malicious code, backdoors, or secrets detected. Network activity is limited to benign version verification. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Sphinx configuration script with no malicious activity or security risks. The use of network requests is typical for version verification and does not pose a security threat. Source linking via reflection is also standard. Overall, the code is safe.",
