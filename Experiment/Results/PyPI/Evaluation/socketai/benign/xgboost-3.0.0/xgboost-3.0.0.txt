There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The native functions are assumed to be part of the official XGBoost codebase, and the overall implementation is safe for use. The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.15), reflecting standard external library interactions and network validation."

      "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, platform-aware utility for locating XGBoost shared libraries. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The previous high risk scores (0.9-1.0) are overestimations; a risk score of approximately 0.1-0.2 is more appropriate, but even 0.0 is justified given the benign nature."

The low malware score (0), obfuscated score (0), and minimal risk score (~0.1-0.2) are justified. It functions as intended for data preparation and interface with native libraries, with no evident security issues."

The low risk score reflects reliance on external native code, which is typical in such bindings but should be verified separately. Overall, the code is benign and well-structured."
