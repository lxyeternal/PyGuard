  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation for managing global configuration in XGBoost. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present. The low risk score reflects reliance on external native code, which is typical in such bindings but should be verified separately. Overall, the code is benign and well-structured."
