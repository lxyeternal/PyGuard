  "purpose": "Provides functions to set and get global configuration for XGBoost via native library calls, with context management support.",
  "sources": "Function parameters (new_config dict), internal JSON serialization, native C library functions (_LIB.XGBSetGlobalConfig, _LIB.XGBGetGlobalConfig).",
  "sinks": "Calls to native functions that set or retrieve configuration data, passing JSON strings as arguments.",
  "flows": "User input (kwargs) serialized into JSON and passed to native functions; configuration data retrieved from native functions and deserialized into Python dicts.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code patterns or unusual data flows.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python wrapper around native C functions for configuration management, employing JSON serialization/deserialization. It filters out None values before serialization, uses ctypes for native calls, and provides context management for temporary configuration changes. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The external native functions are assumed legitimate, and the code structure is clear and well-documented.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation for managing global configuration in XGBoost. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present. The low risk score reflects reliance on external native code, which is typical in such bindings but should be verified separately. Overall, the code is benign and well-structured.",
