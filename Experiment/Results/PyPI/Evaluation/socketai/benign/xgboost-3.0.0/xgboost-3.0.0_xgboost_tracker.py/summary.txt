  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured wrapper around native C functions used for managing a distributed training tracker in XGBoost. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The native functions are assumed to be part of the official XGBoost codebase, and the overall implementation is safe for use. The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.15), reflecting standard external library interactions and network validation."
