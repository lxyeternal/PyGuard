{
  "purpose": "The code defines various type aliases, imports, and ctypes pointer types for use in a larger Python project, likely related to data processing or machine learning with C/C++ extensions.",
  "sources": "Import statements for ctypes, os, and typing modules; type alias definitions; typeVar and ctypes pointer type declarations.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or command executions are present.",
  "flows": "The code primarily sets up type definitions and does not process untrusted data or execute data flows that could lead to security issues.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is mainly type annotations and interface definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of import statements, type alias definitions, and ctypes pointer type declarations. There are no functions, data processing, or external data handling that could lead to security risks. All parts serve as type hints or interface definitions for other modules. No suspicious or malicious behavior is observed. The code appears to be part of a larger secure project structure.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for type annotations and setup, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not process, leak, or execute untrusted data, nor does it contain obfuscated or malicious code.",
