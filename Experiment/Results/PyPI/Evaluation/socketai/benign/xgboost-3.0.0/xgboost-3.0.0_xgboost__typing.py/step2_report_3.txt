  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines type aliases and ctypes pointer types; no data processing.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious activity, no data leaks, no external input handling, purely structural.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, defines type annotations and ctypes mappings.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior; standard ctypes usage.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same pattern: type aliases, ctypes setup, no external data handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar observations: type definitions, no data processing or external input.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same as above, purely type and ctypes setup.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** All reports correctly identify that this code is purely for type annotations and C interop setup.\n- **Malware potential:** No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors.\n- **Security risk:** No data leaks, external data processing, or insecure operations.\n\n### Final scoring:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n### Justification:\nAll reports are consistent in their assessments. The code is a standard infrastructure component, setting up types and ctypes pointers for interfacing with C libraries, which is common in data processing or ML projects. There are no signs of obfuscation, malware, or security issues.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is safe and standard, serving as a foundation for larger modules.",
