{
  "purpose": "Definition of shared type aliases and ctypes related configurations for a Python package, likely related to data processing or machine learning.",
  "sources": "Import statements, type alias definitions, and variable declarations; no external input or data reading sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows identified; the code consists primarily of type definitions and ctypes configurations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is for type annotation and C type interfacing setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code uses standard library and third-party types without unusual constructs or obfuscation. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely defining types, constants, and ctypes configurations for use in other parts of a package. There are no functions executing logic, no data processing, or network interactions. The use of ctypes for C interop is common and appears safe. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident in the code segment. The code avoids dynamic code execution or obfuscated constructs and does not handle untrusted input.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard type and ctypes alias setup for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be infrastructure code supporting other functionalities, with no evidence of malware or security issues.",
