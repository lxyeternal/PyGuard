{
  "purpose": "This code defines shared type annotations and ctypes mappings for a larger Python package, likely related to machine learning or data processing involving C/C++ extensions.",
  "sources": "Type annotations, imports, and variable definitions; no external data input or user input reading.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted input; no data leaks or insecure operations detected.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks involving untrusted data; primarily type definitions and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The code mainly consists of type definitions and ctypes mappings. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of type alias definitions, ctypes pointer types, and union types for data processing, with imports from standard and typing modules. There are no input sources, user data, or external data processing; the code is purely structural. No potentially malicious operations, such as network activity, file access beyond type definitions, or data leakage mechanisms, are present. The use of ctypes mappings appears standard for interfacing with C libraries, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of type and ctypes definitions for a larger data or machine learning package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a standard, safe component used for type safety and C API interfacing.",
