{
  "purpose": "This code defines type aliases, constants, and ctypes pointer types for C interop and data processing infrastructure in Python, without executing any logic or handling external data.",
  "sources": "Imports of standard libraries (`ctypes`, `os`, `typing`) and type alias definitions; no data input or external sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling; the code only sets up type definitions and constants.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or source-to-sink paths, as the code contains only static type and pointer definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely structural, establishing type aliases, constants, and ctypes pointer types for C library interfacing. It does not process untrusted data, execute dynamic code, or perform any operations that could be malicious. The use of ctypes pointers and type aliases is standard for C interop in Python. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard infrastructure setup for type annotations and C library interfacing. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation. The existing reports and scores accurately reflect its benign nature.",
