{
  "purpose": "Define various type aliases, ctypes, and data structures for use in a larger Python project, likely related to data processing or machine learning.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries (ctypes, os, typing, numpy). Type alias definitions and variable initializations.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, as there are no functions executing untrusted input or writing to external systems.",
  "flows": "The code primarily sets up type definitions and does not contain data flows or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, such as dynamic execution, hidden data exfiltration, or malicious control flows. No hardcoded secrets or credentials detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type definitions, imports, and variable declarations. It includes some platform-specific type aliasing for ctypes pointers, but these are standard for C interoperability. No code executes input/output operations, network connections, or data handling beyond type annotations. The code appears to be a foundational setup module, with no indications of malicious intent or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard type definition and import setup module with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It is designed for data structure and type aliasing purposes within a larger, presumably safe, codebase.",
