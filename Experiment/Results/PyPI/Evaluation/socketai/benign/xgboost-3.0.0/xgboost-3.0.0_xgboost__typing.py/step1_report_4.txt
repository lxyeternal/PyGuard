{
  "purpose": "Define shared typing and ctypes-related data structures for a Python package, likely related to data processing or machine learning.",
  "sources": "Imports standard libraries and defines type aliases and ctypes pointers; no external input reading present.",
  "sinks": "No evident sink points where untrusted data flows; no data leakage or malicious data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; primarily type definitions and ctypes structures.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code segments. Use of ctypes pointers is standard for interfacing with C libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of type alias definitions, ctypes pointer types, and annotations. No external inputs are processed, and no operations or data manipulations suggest malicious intent. The code appears to be a type declaration and setup module for C library interactions. There are no indications of data leaks, malicious injections, or backdoors. Use of standard libraries and ctypes is consistent with normal inter-language interfacing. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of type definitions and ctypes interface setup, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate utility module for type annotations and C library interactions within a larger project.",
