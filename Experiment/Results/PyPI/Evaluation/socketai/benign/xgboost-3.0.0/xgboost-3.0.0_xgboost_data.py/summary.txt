  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-validated data dispatching layer with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low malware score (0), obfuscated score (0), and minimal risk score (~0.1-0.2) are justified. It functions as intended for data preparation and interface with native libraries, with no evident security issues."
