{
  "purpose": "The code provides compatibility and optional dependency management for various data processing libraries, including pandas, sklearn, cudf, cupy, pyarrow, polars, and scipy, with version checks and utility functions for data concatenation.",
  "sources": "Import statements, importlib.util.find_spec for module detection, sys.version_info for version checks, and internal functions for dependency validation.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic imports, data concatenation functions, and cache mechanisms; no external data or untrusted input processing.",
  "flows": "Dependency detection via importlib, conditional imports based on module availability, and data concatenation across different data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns; standard dependency management and data handling practices; no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward compatibility layer handling optional dependencies and data concatenation. It uses safe import checks, caching, and version validation. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The dynamic import patterns are controlled and based on package availability, not untrusted input. The data concatenation function supports multiple data formats safely. Overall, the code is benign, well-structured, and intended for compatibility purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for dependency detection and data handling, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), justified by the controlled import mechanisms and standard data processing functions.",
