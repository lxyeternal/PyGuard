  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, potential security implications, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The report correctly identifies that the code handles optional dependencies, dynamic imports, and version checks, primarily via `importlib.util.find_spec`, direct imports, and `sys.version_info`.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks or malicious data flows are evident. Dynamic imports are controlled and based on package availability, not untrusted input.\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No suspicious or malicious behavior is observed. The code uses standard patterns for compatibility.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** The report assigns malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which is reasonable. The security risk is low (~0.2), given the reliance on standard import mechanisms and the absence of code execution from untrusted sources.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning is sound; no changes needed. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, it recognizes the code's role in dependency management and compatibility.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No malicious data flows or external network activity. Dynamic imports are based on package detection.\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No suspicious code or obfuscation. The code's structure is typical for such utility modules.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; security risk is minimal (~0.1-0.2). These are justified.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning aligns with the code's nature. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes the code's role in dependency detection and utility functions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks or malicious code execution. The dynamic import pattern is safe.\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No suspicious behavior or obfuscation. Usage of `importlib.util.find_spec` is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; security risk is low (~0.1). These are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is accurate; scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Recognizes the code as a compatibility and utility module, with dependency checks and data concatenation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No evidence of malicious data flow or external communication.\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or backdoors. Use of caching and safe imports is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; security risk is minimal (~0.2). These are reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning is sound; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous reports, correctly identifies dependency detection and optional imports.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No malicious or unsafe operations involving untrusted data.\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No obfuscation or malicious patterns. The code is standard for dependency management.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; security risk is low (~0.2). Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Review:** The code is a standard compatibility and utility module for handling optional dependencies, version checks, and data concatenation across multiple formats.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the benign nature of the code.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly above zero (~0.1-0.2), reflecting the potential risk inherent in dynamic imports, but no actual malicious activity is present.\n- **Potential Vulnerabilities:** No evidence of supply chain issues, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The code does not execute untrusted input or perform unsafe operations.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the reliance on dynamic imports and optional dependencies, a score of around 0.1-0.2 is justified, reflecting minimal risk.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign, well-structured compatibility layer with no malicious intent. The scores assigned by the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.",
