  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The report correctly identifies that the code handles optional dependencies, dynamic imports, and version checks. The sources are mainly importlib, sys, and direct imports, which are standard.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** The report notes that dynamic imports are potential sink points but are controlled via hardcoded module names or package detection, not external input. The flow is standard for dependency detection and data concatenation.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious anomalies or malicious code are observed. The code is a typical compatibility layer. The use of assertions and caching is standard.\n\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** The report concludes the code is benign, with a high confidence (0.9), and assigns malware and obfuscated scores as 0, with a low security risk (0.2). This seems reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning is sound, and the scores are appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, it correctly identifies the code's role in dependency management and compatibility.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** The analysis recognizes that module detection and import are controlled and do not process untrusted data.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious behavior or obfuscation is detected. The code's structure is typical for such utility modules.\n\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** The report assigns a high confidence (0.9), with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a security risk of 0.1, which seems appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate reasoning, scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states that the code manages optional dependencies with importlib and conditional imports.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks or malicious activities are identified.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns; standard dependency detection and utility functions.\n\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** The confidence is high (0.9), malware and obfuscated scores at 0, security risk low (0.1). This aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n**Verdict:** Well-reasoned, scores appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, dependency checks and data concatenation.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or network activity; the code processes in-memory data.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious or malicious code detected. The code's purpose is compatibility and data handling.\n\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** Confidence at 1.0, malware and obfuscated at 0, security risk low (0.2). The higher confidence reflects the thoroughness, which is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar dependency detection and compatibility functions.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No dangerous or malicious activities identified; no external data leaks.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** Confidence at 0.9, malware and obfuscated at 0, security risk low (0.2). Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Well justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify that the code does not contain malicious payloads or behavior. Scores at 0 are appropriate.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation detected. Scores at 0 are justified.\n\n- **Risk Score:** The overall security risk is low, given the code's benign nature, dependency checks, and utility functions. Slightly higher for some reports (0.2), which is reasonable considering the use of dynamic imports, but no actual vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores across reports are consistent and justified.\n- No changes needed; the reasoning aligns with the code's purpose.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at or near zero, with a very low security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard compatibility and utility module with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and reflect the benign nature of the code.",
