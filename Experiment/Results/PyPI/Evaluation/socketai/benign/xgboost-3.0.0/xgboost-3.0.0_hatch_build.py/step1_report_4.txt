  "purpose": "Customize the wheel tag of a Python package build process using Hatchling.",
  "sources": "Reading system platform tags via packaging.tags and input parameters for initialize method.",
  "sinks": "Assigning the generated tag to build_data['tag'], which is used in the build process.",
  "flows": "get_tag() retrieves platform tags; initialize() calls get_tag() and assigns to build_data['tag'].",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears straightforward and adheres to expected behavior for customization.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a helper function get_tag() that retrieves the current platform tag and formats it into a wheel tag string. The CustomBuildHook class implements an interface to modify build data, specifically setting the 'tag' key using get_tag(). There are no suspicious data flows, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no external network interactions. The code is clean, purposeful, and does not contain obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard customization hook for Python package building, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply modifies build metadata based on system platform info.",
