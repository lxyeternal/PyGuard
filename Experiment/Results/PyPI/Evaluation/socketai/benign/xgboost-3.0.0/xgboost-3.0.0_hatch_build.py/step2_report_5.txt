  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores and conclusions.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is straightforward, involving standard modules (`packaging.tags`) and typical build hook patterns.\n- No external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The purpose is to customize wheel tags based on system platform, which is a common practice.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code behaviors are identified.\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious or suspicious behaviors.\n- The logic is simple and aligns with standard build customization practices.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- There are **no logical errors** or security flaws.\n- The only minor typo in the comment (\"This step ccurs...\") is inconsequential for security.\n\n### Score analysis:\n\n#### Malware score:\n- All reports assign **0**, which is appropriate.\n- No malicious activity is present or implied.\n\n#### Obfuscated score:\n- All reports assign **0**, which is correct.\n- The code is clear and readable.\n\n#### Security risk score:\n- All reports assign **0**, which is justified.\n- No vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are present.\n\n#### Justification for high scores (>0.5):\n- None of the scores exceed 0.5, and this is correct given the benign nature.\n\n### Consistency and reasoning:\n- The reports consistently identify the code as benign, straightforward, and standard.\n- The reasoning is sound, and the conclusions are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Risk score:** **0**\n\nThe code is a simple, well-understood build hook for customizing wheel tags, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The code is benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements.\n- The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent.\n- No changes to scores or conclusions are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is safe and standard for its purpose.",
