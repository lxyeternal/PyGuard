{
  "purpose": "Customize the wheel tag during the build process of a Python package using Hatchling.",
  "sources": "The code reads system platform tags via the 'packaging.tags' module and the 'build_data' dictionary during initialization.",
  "sinks": "The 'build_data' dictionary is modified to include a system-dependent tag, which influences the wheel filename.",
  "flows": "System platform tags are retrieved from 'packaging.tags' and stored in 'build_data['tag']', which is used in wheel creation.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward and standard for customizing build tags; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code observed. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a 'get_tag' function that constructs a system-specific wheel tag using 'packaging.tags'. The 'CustomBuildHook' class inherits from 'BuildHookInterface' and overrides 'initialize' to set the 'tag' in 'build_data' using 'get_tag'. This setup is typical for customizing build behavior in Python packaging. No malicious activities, such as data exfiltration or backdoors, are evident. The code is minimal and aligns with standard practices for build hooks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard customization hook for Python package builds, modifying the wheel tag based on system platform. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks in the provided code.",
