  "purpose": "Customize the wheel tag for package builds in Hatchling.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; only internal function calls and attribute access.",
  "sinks": "Assigning the 'tag' value in build_data dictionary.",
  "flows": "initialize() method calls get_tag() and assigns its return value to build_data['tag'].",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. No obfuscated code or hidden functionalities.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a utility function get_tag() to generate a system-specific wheel tag using packaging's platform_tags(). It then defines a custom build hook class that overrides the initialize() method to set the 'tag' in the build_data dictionary with the generated tag. All code appears to be straightforward, intended for customizing build metadata, with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior. The code uses well-known libraries and patterns for build customization without any external data input or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign build hook intended to set wheel tags based on system platform. No malicious intent or security risks are detected.",
