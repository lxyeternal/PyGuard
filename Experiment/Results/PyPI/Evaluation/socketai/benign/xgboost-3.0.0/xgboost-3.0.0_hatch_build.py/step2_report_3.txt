  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code: a straightforward custom build hook that sets a wheel tag based on system platform tags.\n- The code is simple, uses well-known libraries (`packaging.tags`), and performs no external data input, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- No suspicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic are evident.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- The security risk scores are also 0, which seems appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence:** The code described in the reports matches the provided code snippet exactly.\n- **Functionality:** The code's purpose is to generate a system-specific wheel tag and assign it during the build process, which is a common and legitimate use case.\n- **Behavior:** No anomalies, suspicious flows, or external interactions are present.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- No logical errors or flaws are evident in the code or reasoning.\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score (0):** Correct, no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated (0):** Correct, code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk (0):** Correct, no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- The risk score is 0 across all reports, which is justified given the benign nature.\n- No reason to increase the risk score unless new evidence suggests otherwise.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the code and analysis.\n- The reasoning aligns with the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks)\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The code could be slightly extended or modified to include external inputs, but as-is, it is safe.\n- The reports are thorough and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a benign, standard implementation of a build hook for customizing wheel tags based on system platform. All scores and reasoning are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nNo changes needed.",
