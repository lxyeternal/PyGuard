  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Verification:**  \n   All reports describe the code as a straightforward implementation of a custom build hook for Hatchling, intended to set the wheel tag based on system platform info. The code reads system tags via `packaging.tags.platform_tags()`, constructs a string, and assigns it to `build_data[\"tag\"]`. There are no indications of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n\n2. **Logical and Security Flaws:**  \n   The code is simple and aligns with standard practices for build customization. No external inputs, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present. The reports correctly identify that the code's purpose is benign and that it doesn't introduce security risks.\n\n3. **Score Justification:**  \n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, correctly indicating the code is clear and understandable.  \n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the code's benign nature.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Assumptions:**  \n   The reports are cautious and correctly note that the code does not perform any suspicious actions or contain vulnerabilities. No assumptions about malicious intent are warranted here.\n\n5. **Consistency and Reasonableness of Scores:**  \n   The scores across all reports are consistent and reasonable. Given the code's nature, no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (No malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (Code is straightforward)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 (No security risks identified)\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, well-structured, and aligns with standard build customization practices. No supply chain or security concerns are present.**",
