  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review & Functionality Confirmation:**\n   - The code defines a simple utility function `get_tag()` that retrieves the current system's platform tags via `packaging.tags.platform_tags()` and formats a wheel tag string.\n   - The `CustomBuildHook` class inherits from `BuildHookInterface` and overrides `initialize()` to set `build_data[\"tag\"]` to the value returned by `get_tag()`.\n   - All reports agree that the code is straightforward, uses standard libraries, and performs a benign operation: customizing the wheel tag based on system platform.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors are present.\n   - No external data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The code's purpose aligns with standard build customization practices.\n\n3. **Analysis of Scores:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n   - These scores are consistent with the code's benign nature.\n   - The `confidence` is 1, indicating high certainty that the code is safe.\n   \n4. **Potential Issues or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward and does not contain malicious logic.\n   - There are no assumptions about vulnerabilities; the code simply interacts with well-known modules and APIs.\n\n5. **Overall Consistency & Recommendations:**\n   - The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.\n   - No adjustments are necessary based on the current analysis.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - The code's purpose is limited to build metadata customization; it does not introduce any security risks.\n   - The use of `packaging.tags.platform_tags()` is standard for such purposes.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is benign, standard, and does not pose any security threat.",
