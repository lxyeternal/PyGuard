  "purpose": "Locate the dynamic library files for the xgboost package across different platforms and installation methods.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (XGBOOST_BUILD_DOC), __file__ (current script location), sys.platform, platform.system()",
  "sinks": "os.path.exists(), os.path.isfile(), raising exception when library files are not found",
  "flows": "Environment variable check -> determine library paths -> check file existence -> return paths or raise exception",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors; standard path constructions and environment variable checks",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to locate xgboost shared library files based on platform-specific conventions. It uses environment variables and system attributes to build potential paths, then filters existing files. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or malicious actions are present. The code raises an exception if the library isn't found, which is typical for ensuring dependencies are met. The environment variable check for 'XGBOOST_BUILD_DOC' is benign and used for documentation build skipping. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for locating library files needed for xgboost, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs typical file system checks and path manipulations to facilitate package operation. Overall, it appears safe and legitimate.",
