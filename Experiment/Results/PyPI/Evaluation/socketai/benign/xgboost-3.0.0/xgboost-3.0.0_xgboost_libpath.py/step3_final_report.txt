  "purpose": "Locate the platform-specific shared library files for XGBoost by constructing candidate paths based on environment variables, system platform info, and typical install locations, then verifying their existence.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'XGBOOST_BUILD_DOC', filesystem paths constructed from current directory, system prefix, and platform-specific directories.",
  "sinks": "Filesystem checks for library files; raises exception if not found (except during documentation build).",
  "flows": "Constructed candidate paths are checked for existence; if none found and not building docs, an exception is raised.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code; standard filesystem operations and environment variable usage.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign utility for locating shared libraries across platforms. It uses environment variables and system info to generate candidate paths, then verifies their existence. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or credential handling is present. The exception is used solely for operational failure notification. All signals indicate standard, safe behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, platform-aware utility for locating XGBoost shared libraries. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The previous high risk scores (0.9-1.0) are overestimations; a risk score of approximately 0.1-0.2 is more appropriate, but even 0.0 is justified given the benign nature.",
