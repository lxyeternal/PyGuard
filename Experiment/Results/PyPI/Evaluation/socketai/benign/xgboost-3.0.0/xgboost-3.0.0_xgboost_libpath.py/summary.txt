  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, platform-aware utility for locating XGBoost shared libraries. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The previous high risk scores (0.9-1.0) are overestimations; a risk score of approximately 0.1-0.2 is more appropriate, but even 0.0 is justified given the benign nature."
