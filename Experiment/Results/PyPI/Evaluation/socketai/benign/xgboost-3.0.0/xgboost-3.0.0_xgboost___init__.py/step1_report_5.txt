{
  "purpose": "This code initializes and exports components of the XGBoost library, including core classes, training functions, plotting utilities, and scikit-learn wrappers.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules and functions from the same package; no external untrusted data sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain sinks that handle untrusted data or perform potentially harmful actions such as network access, file modifications, or command execution.",
  "flows": "There are no explicit data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code mainly sets up module exports and conditional imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns are present. The try-except block for optional imports is standard. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, module initialization, and export definitions for the XGBoost package. The optional import block gracefully handles missing dependencies. The versioning and __all__ declaration are standard. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, legitimate module initialization script for the XGBoost library. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is detected.",
