  "purpose": "Standard package initialization (__init__.py) for the XGBoost Python library, importing modules, setting version, and exposing components.",
  "sources": "Module import statements, optional dependency try-except block",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no network activity, no data leaks",
  "flows": "Import statements and attribute assignments without external data flow",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; optional imports are standard",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical __init__.py for a well-known open-source package, performing module imports, version setting, and exposing API components. It includes a try-except for optional dependencies, which is common practice. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or suspicious patterns. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the minimal security risk score of 0.1 in one report appears to overestimate risk; given the benign nature, it should be 0. All reports correctly identify the code as safe and standard, with the exception of a slight overestimation in risk in one case.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initializer with no malicious behavior or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; the minor risk score of 0.1 should be adjusted to 0 for consistency. Overall, the code is safe and legitimate.",
