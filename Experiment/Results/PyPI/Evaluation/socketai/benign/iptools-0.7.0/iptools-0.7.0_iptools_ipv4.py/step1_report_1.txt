{
  "purpose": "Provide IP address validation, conversion, and subnet calculations for network-related operations.",
  "sources": "Regular expressions for validating IP and CIDR formats, input parameters to validation functions, IP address strings, and CIDR strings.",
  "sinks": "Conversion functions like ip2long, long2ip, and hex2ip that generate outputs from validated data; no untrusted sinks that execute or leak data found.",
  "flows": "Input strings are validated by regex, then processed through conversion and calculation functions to produce IP addresses, integers, or network ranges.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors observed. Compatibility code for Python 2 and 3 is standard. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code focuses on IP validation, conversion, and subnet calculations with proper validation and documentation. The functions use regex for validation and straightforward IP math. No data leakage, network communication, or malicious behavior is evident. The compatibility fixes are standard practice. The presence of comprehensive IP handling functions suggests utility code, not malicious or sabotage intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility library for IP and network calculations. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks identified. The functions are safe, well-documented, and follow standard practices.",
