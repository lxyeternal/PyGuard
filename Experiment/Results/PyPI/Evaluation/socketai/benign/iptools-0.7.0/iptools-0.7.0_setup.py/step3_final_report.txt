  "purpose": "Standard setup.py script for packaging the iptools Python library, defining metadata, dependencies, and configuration.",
  "sources": "Imports version info from iptools, reads command-line args for test dependencies, and static package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no dynamic code execution or network activity.",
  "flows": "Command-line args influence test dependencies; no external data flows or untrusted inputs processed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, well-structured setup.py for Python packaging. It imports version info, conditionally adds test dependencies based on command-line args, and defines package metadata. There are no dynamic data flows, network operations, or malicious behaviors. The code follows standard practices, and no vulnerabilities or obfuscation are present. The minimal handling of command-line args is benign and common in such scripts. All signals indicate a safe, benign package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py script is a standard, benign package configuration file with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and safe. Scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all 0, consistent with the analysis.",
