{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'iptools' Python package, intended to package and distribute IPv4/IPv6 address utilities.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (command-line arguments), __version__ from iptools module",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no data flows leading to insecure operations or data leaks",
  "flows": "Command-line args influence setup_requires; no untrusted data flows identified",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected; standard setup script",
  "analysis": "The script imports system modules and package-specific version info, then dynamically adjusts setup requirements based on command-line args. The setup() function configures package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and descriptions. All code appears to be standard package setup procedures without any code injection, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors. No sources or sinks indicative of security risks or malware are present. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It follows typical packaging conventions and does not contain any anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
