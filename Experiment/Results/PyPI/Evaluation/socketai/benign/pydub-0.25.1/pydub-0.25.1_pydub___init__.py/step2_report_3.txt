  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Report 1**\n   - **Issue presence:** The code is a simple import statement. No issues are present.\n   - **Errors or flaws:** None. The reasoning is sound.\n   - **Scores:** All scores (obfuscated, malware, securityRisk) are 0, which is appropriate.\n   - **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n2. **Report 2**\n   - **Issue presence:** Same as above; a straightforward import.\n   - **Errors or flaws:** None.\n   - **Scores:** All zeros, consistent with the benign nature.\n   - **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n3. **Report 3**\n   - **Issue presence:** Again, just an import statement, no signs of malicious activity.\n   - **Errors or flaws:** None.\n   - **Scores:** All zero, except confidence at 0.9, which is acceptable but slightly less than perfect; still consistent.\n   - **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n4. **Report 4**\n   - **Issue presence:** No issues detected; simple import.\n   - **Errors or flaws:** None.\n   - **Scores:** All zero, appropriate.\n   - **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n5. **Report 5**\n   - **Issue presence:** Same as others; no malicious activity.\n   - **Errors or flaws:** None.\n   - **Scores:** All zero, consistent.\n   - **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- All reports are consistent in indicating that this code snippet is benign.\n- The import statement is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or data leaks.\n- The confidence levels are high, and all malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are zero.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\nThis aligns with the overall analysis: a simple, benign import statement with no security concerns.\n\n**Note:** If any future reports suggest malicious activity or obfuscation, scores should be adjusted accordingly, but based on current data, all scores remain at zero.",
