  "purpose": "Import a local module 'audio_segment' and its class 'AudioSegment' in a Python package.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external data or input sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows, no data leaks, no external network or system interactions.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is a simple import without data flow or execution beyond module loading.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward import statement with standard syntax.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python import statement importing 'AudioSegment' from a local module. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The import is typical for Python packages and does not involve any dynamic code execution, external dependencies, or data handling that could pose security risks. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the benign nature of the code. Confidence in this assessment is high, given the simplicity and clarity of the code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard import statement with no security concerns or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify this, and no adjustments are necessary.",
