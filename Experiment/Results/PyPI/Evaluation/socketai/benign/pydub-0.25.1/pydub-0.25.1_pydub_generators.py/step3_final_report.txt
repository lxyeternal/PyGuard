{
  "purpose": "The code provides waveform generators (sine, pulse, square, sawtooth, triangle, white noise) that produce audio samples for synthesis and conversion into audio segments.",
  "sources": "The generate() methods within each waveform class, producing sample data; no external data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "The converted array data fed into AudioSegment; no untrusted data or external sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Waveform generators produce samples → samples scaled and converted to byte data → data passed to AudioSegment for audio creation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external data leaks detected. Use of random for noise is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard waveform synthesis with no external dependencies or network activity. The generate() methods yield waveform samples, which are scaled and converted into audio data. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The use of random for white noise is typical and not malicious. The data flow is straightforward, and the code structure is clear.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward waveform generator library with no malicious intent or security issues. The minor security risk score in some reports (0.2) is justified by the use of randomness but does not indicate any actual security threat. Overall, the code is safe and free of malicious activity.",
