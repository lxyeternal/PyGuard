{
  "purpose": "The code defines various signal generator classes for producing audio waveforms such as sine, pulse, square, sawtooth, triangle, and white noise, which can be converted into audio segments.",
  "sources": "The generate() methods in each class, especially in WhiteNoise which uses random.random() for input data generation.",
  "sinks": "The to_audio_segment() method converts generated samples into audio data, but there are no external untrusted data sinks or network operations.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from the generate() methods to array construction, then to bytes conversion, and finally into AudioSegment objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are evident. No use of network, system commands, or data exfiltration is present. The code appears to be legitimate waveform generation logic with standard library usage.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several waveform generator classes that produce audio samples within a specified range. It utilizes standard libraries and external functions for data formatting and volume adjustments. No suspicious code constructs, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior such as network access, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors are present. The use of random for white noise is normal for such generators. No external data sources or sinks are identified that could indicate malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign set of audio waveform generators with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It is standard waveform generation code with safe practices and no malicious signals.",
