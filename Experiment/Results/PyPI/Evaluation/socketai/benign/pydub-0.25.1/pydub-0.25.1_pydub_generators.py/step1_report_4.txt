{
  "purpose": "Generate various audio waveform samples (sine, pulse, square, sawtooth, triangle, white noise) and convert them into audio segments for sound synthesis or testing.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as frequency, duration, volume, and waveform type; data from generate() methods producing waveform samples.",
  "sinks": "Data written to array object and then converted to bytes (tobytes/tostring), used to create an AudioSegment object.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> generate() yielding waveform samples -> sample data scaled and stored in array -> converted to bytes -> AudioSegment creation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of random for noise generation is expected and benign. No network operations, file manipulations, or external calls observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of waveform generators that produce audio signals based on mathematical formulas. The generate() methods yield continuous sample streams, which are then scaled according to volume and bit depth. The data is stored in array objects and converted into bytes for creating AudioSegment instances. No external or untrusted data sources, no file or network I/O, and no suspicious code behavior such as data exfiltration or command execution are present. Usage of random for white noise is standard. No obfuscation techniques or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate waveform generator library intended for audio synthesis. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. The implementation is straightforward and safe.",
