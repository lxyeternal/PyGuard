  "purpose": "Media processing utilities for media info extraction, system command detection, and audio manipulation.",
  "sources": "File inputs, subprocess command outputs, environment variables, regex parsing of stderr outputs.",
  "sinks": "External media tools invoked via subprocess, no untrusted data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "File reading -> subprocess command execution -> regex parsing -> data extraction and media info structuring.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code; subprocess calls are standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code provides media info extraction, system tool detection, and audio processing functions. It uses subprocess to invoke external tools like ffmpeg, ffprobe, avconv, etc., with proper platform considerations. Regex parsing of stderr outputs is straightforward. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. The code is well-structured, with no obfuscation or unsafe practices evident. The subprocess calls are typical for media utilities and do not suggest malicious intent. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to subprocess invocation, but no vulnerabilities are demonstrated.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate media utility library with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is 0.2, reflecting standard operational risks without active vulnerabilities. The confidence in this assessment is high (0.9).",
