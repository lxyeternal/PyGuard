  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a media utility library for media info extraction, processing, and system tool interfacing. No malicious behavior, secrets, or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code uses subprocess calls for media tools, which is standard. No signs of malware or obfuscation. The security risk score is low but not zero, possibly due to subprocess usage.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with focus on media info extraction and system command detection. No malicious activity or obfuscation observed.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. No malicious behaviors or secrets. The subprocess calls are typical.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for media processing, with subprocess calls to ffmpeg, avconv, etc. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly identifies standard media processing functions. No malicious intent or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Media info extraction, system command invocation, and media processing utilities. No malicious behaviors or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. External tool invocation is standard and does not imply malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for media info, audio processing, and system interaction. No malicious intent or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code’s behavior. No suspicious activity detected.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Analysis:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.2), justified by the use of subprocesses to invoke external tools, which could pose risks if inputs are not sanitized. However, the code itself does not demonstrate unsafe practices or vulnerabilities.\n\n**My Final Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent and well-structured.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — acceptable, given the reliance on external tools and subprocess calls, but no active vulnerabilities.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code appears to be a legitimate media utility library with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The assigned scores are reasonable and consistent with the detailed analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and maintain the security risk at around 0.2, considering the external subprocess interactions but no evident vulnerabilities.",
