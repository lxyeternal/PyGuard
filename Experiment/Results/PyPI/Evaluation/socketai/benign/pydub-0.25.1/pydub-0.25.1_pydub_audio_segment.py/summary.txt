  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate multimedia processing library with no malware or obfuscation detected. The primary security concern is the potential for command injection via subprocess calls if parameters are not validated, which is a common and addressable vulnerability. Scores should reflect this moderate risk, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and the security risk score increased to about 0.5. Ensuring input sanitization would significantly reduce this risk. Overall, the code is safe for use in controlled environments with validated inputs, but caution is advised to prevent injection vulnerabilities."
