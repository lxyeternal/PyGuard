{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the Pydub library to handle various audio processing errors.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading; the code only defines classes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or data handling; solely class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code consists of straightforward class definitions for exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a base exception class 'PydubException' and several specific subclasses representing different error conditions related to audio processing. All classes are empty and inherit directly from the base exception class. There are no suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no external interactions. The structure and content are typical for a Python library's exception handling and do not suggest malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely establishes custom exceptions for error handling within the Pydub library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears safe and standard for its purpose.",
