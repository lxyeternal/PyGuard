  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for Pydub-related errors to handle specific audio processing issues.",
  "sources": "None (no input or data reading, only class definitions).",
  "sinks": "None (no data output, no untrusted data handling).",
  "flows": "Not applicable (no data flow from source to sink).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward class inheritance for exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from a base exception class. There are no input sources, data processing, or output sinks. The classes serve as error indicators for various audio processing errors within a larger application or library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious activity. The code appears standard for Python exception handling design, with no external data interactions or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple and standard set of custom exception classes for a Python audio processing library. It poses no security risks, malware, or malicious intent. It is purely for error handling within the intended library context.",
