  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Presence and Functionality:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to Pydub.\n   - There are no signs of embedded malicious code, dynamic execution, or data handling.\n   - The code is static, straightforward, and typical for Python exception class definitions.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly note the absence of suspicious activity, obfuscation, or external data interactions.\n   - No errors or logical flaws are apparent in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - The security risk scores are 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - Confidence levels are high (1 or 1.0), which is justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely for defining exception classes with no executable or malicious content, risk scores higher than 0.5 are unwarranted.\n   - All reports agree on a risk score of 0, which is appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, correctly indicating no malicious activity.\n   - The code does not perform any actions that could be malicious.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's content.\n   - The assessments are cautious and accurate.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Overall Evaluation:**\n- The code is standard, benign, and intended solely for error handling.\n- The reports are accurate and thorough.\n- No adjustments to scores are necessary.\n\n**My Final Estimate:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a typical, safe set of exception class definitions with no security concerns. The reports correctly identify this, and the scoring reflects the benign nature accurately.",
