  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various Pydub-related errors",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources are present in the code",
  "sinks": "No output, data leak, or untrusted data handling is present",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink occurs in this code",
  "anomalies": "Code solely consists of custom exception class definitions with no unusual or suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes inheriting from a base PydubException. These classes are used for error handling within the Pydub library. There are no embedded malicious instructions, no dynamic code execution, and no external data handling. The code is straightforward and standard for exception class definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for defining exception classes related to Pydub errors. There are no malicious behaviors, backdoors, or security risks present. It is a standard implementation with no suspicious activity.",
