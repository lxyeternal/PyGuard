  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Content Confirmation:**\n- The code defines a set of custom exception classes inheriting from a base `PydubException`.\n- No executable logic, data processing, external data handling, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The classes are straightforward, serving as error indicators.\n\n**Assessment of Report Validity:**\n- All reports correctly identify that this code is solely for defining exception classes.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious behaviors are detected.\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and poses no security risks.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 in all reports is appropriate. No malicious activity or code is present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security Risk Score:** 0 is justified, as there are no vulnerabilities, backdoors, or malicious behaviors.\n\n**Any discrepancies or points to challenge?**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. No changes needed.\n- The high confidence (1.0) across reports aligns with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n**Overall Risk Estimation:**\n- The code is purely for error handling, with no malicious intent.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should remain at **0**.\n\n**Final Remarks:**\n- The code is a standard implementation of custom exceptions for a Python library.\n- No further security concerns are evident from this snippet.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments and the code's nature.",
