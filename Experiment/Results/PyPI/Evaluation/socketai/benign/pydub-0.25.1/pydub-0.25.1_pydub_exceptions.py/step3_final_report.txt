  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in the Pydub library.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from Exception and PydubException, no external data or input handling.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data flows; purely class declarations.",
  "flows": "N/A - static class definitions, no data flow or execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward exception class definitions with no dynamic code or embedded data.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from a base exception class. There are no executable statements, data processing, external data handling, or dynamic code execution. The classes serve as error indicators for the Pydub library. The code is static, clear, and typical for Python exception handling. No suspicious patterns, malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The code's simplicity and purpose are transparent, and the absence of any malicious activity or obfuscation is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security concerns. The provided reports are accurate, consistent, and appropriately assess the benign nature of the code. The malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores should all be 0, with high confidence in this assessment.",
