  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from `Exception`. There are no executable statements, data processing, external data handling, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The reports correctly identify that these are standard exception classes with no suspicious behavior.\n   - **Conclusion:** No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious code are present in the code snippet.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. They correctly state that the code is benign, standard, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n   - No logical errors or misconceptions are evident in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Suggestion:** The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since there is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks, higher scores are unwarranted.\n   - The code is straightforward class definitions for error handling, with no signs of malicious intent.\n   - **Conclusion:** The risk scores should remain at 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign `malware` as 0.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity or contain malicious payloads.\n   - **Conclusion:** The malware score is accurate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions about potential vulnerabilities; they focus on the code's straightforward purpose.\n   - No unwarranted claims are present.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a simple, standard set of exception class definitions with no malicious or suspicious activity. The reports are thorough and accurate, and the scores reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis supply chain component is safe, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation detected. The scores and analysis are appropriate and consistent.",
