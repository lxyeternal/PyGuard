{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the Pydub audio processing library to handle various error conditions.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading occurs in this code; it only defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present; this code does not process or transmit data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks since this is purely class definition with no execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs; only standard exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a hierarchy of custom exception classes inheriting from the base Exception class, specifically for handling different error scenarios in Pydub. All classes are simple and contain no executable logic, data processing, or external interactions. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security issues. The structure is straightforward and typical for Python exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard and benign set of exception class definitions intended for error handling within the Pydub library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks.",
