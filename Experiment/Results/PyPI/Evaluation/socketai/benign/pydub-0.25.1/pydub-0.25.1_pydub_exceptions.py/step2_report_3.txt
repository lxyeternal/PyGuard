  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code solely consists of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from a base class.\n   - No external data handling, dynamic code execution, or other suspicious behaviors are present.\n   - The code is straightforward and typical for exception handling.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - They correctly state that there are no malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - No errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - All reports assign a confidence of 1, and malware, obfuscated, and securityRisk scores are all 0.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:\n   - Since all reports confidently state that the code is purely for defining exception classes with no malicious intent, the risk scores should remain at 0.\n   - Any higher score would be unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - No malicious activity is suggested or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they accurately describe the code's purpose and behavior.\n   - Their conclusions are justified.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with Reports**:\n   - The scores are consistent and appropriate.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- The code is a standard set of exception class definitions with no malicious or security concerns.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at 0.\n- The confidence scores are correctly set at 1.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (clear, straightforward class definitions)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary**:\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The code is benign, with no security issues. The scores reflect this appropriately.",
