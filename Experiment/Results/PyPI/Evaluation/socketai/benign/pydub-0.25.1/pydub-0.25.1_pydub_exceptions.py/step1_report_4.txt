  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various errors related to the Pydub library.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and inheritance from the base Exception class.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or output data.",
  "flows": "Class definitions and inheritance do not establish data flows or execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and consists solely of class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from a common base class. These classes are standard for error handling in Python and contain no executable code, user input handling, or external data processing. There are no suspicious or malicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The structure is simple, clear, and conventional for exception definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for defining custom exceptions related to the Pydub library. It poses no security threat or malicious behavior. It does not contain malware, hidden backdoors, or malicious logic.",
