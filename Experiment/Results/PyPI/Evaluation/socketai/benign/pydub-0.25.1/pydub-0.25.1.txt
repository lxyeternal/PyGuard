      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate multimedia processing library with no malware or obfuscation detected. The primary security concern is the potential for command injection via subprocess calls if parameters are not validated, which is a common and addressable vulnerability. Scores should reflect this moderate risk, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and the security risk score increased to about 0.5. Ensuring input sanitization would significantly reduce this risk. Overall, the code is safe for use in controlled environments with validated inputs, but caution is advised to prevent injection vulnerabilities."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign logging utility with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The only security consideration is potential leakage of secrets if 'conversion_command' contains sensitive info, which is already reflected in a low security risk score. Overall, the code is safe and straightforward."

      "conclusion": "The code is generally benign and well-structured for audio playback, but reliance on get_player_name() for external command execution introduces a security risk if the function's output is untrusted. This could allow command injection. Therefore, while no malware is present, the security risk should be considered moderate, and validation of get_player_name() output is recommended."

The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal (around 0.1), justified by potential misuse but no active threats."
