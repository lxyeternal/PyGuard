  "purpose": "Functions for detecting, manipulating, and splitting audio segments based on silence, primarily for audio processing workflows.",
  "sources": "Input audio_segment data, parameters for silence thresholds and lengths, internal calculations using rms and max_possible_amplitude.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; data processed entirely in-memory; no network or file I/O.",
  "flows": "Input audio_segment -> rms and amplitude calculations -> silence detection logic -> output ranges for segmentation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward implementation; no obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard silence detection and segmentation in audio data using RMS and decibel thresholds. It relies on in-memory processing with no external communication or file handling. The functions are logically consistent, with proper handling of edge cases, and use common Python libraries. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The parameters are used in a typical manner, and the code's structure is clear and transparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard utility for silence detection and segmentation in audio processing. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2) are justified and appropriate given the context.",
