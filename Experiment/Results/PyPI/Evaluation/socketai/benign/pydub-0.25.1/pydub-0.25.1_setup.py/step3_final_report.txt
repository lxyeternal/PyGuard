  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging the 'pydub' library.",
  "sources": "Reads from the module-level docstring (__doc__) for long_description.",
  "sinks": "None; static data used, no untrusted input or external data sources.",
  "flows": "From __doc__ to long_description parameter in setup().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; static, straightforward code with no dynamic or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' configuration for a Python package, importing only 'setup' from 'setuptools' and calling it with static metadata. It does not process external inputs, execute dynamic code, connect to networks, or contain obfuscated or malicious code. All indicators point to a benign, standard package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard package configuration with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reviewed reports correctly identify its benign nature and assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
