  "purpose": "The code implements a comprehensive energy and emissions tracking system for Python projects, supporting both online and offline modes, with configuration via environment variables, files, and API endpoints. It collects hardware metrics, environmental data, and reports emissions through various outputs.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, configuration files, hardware sensors, API endpoints, user inputs, and external telemetry endpoints.",
  "sinks": "Logs, CSV files, HTTP API endpoints, Prometheus, Logfire, and other output handlers.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment/configuration sources to hardware sensors and external telemetry endpoints, with internal processing for emissions calculation and reporting.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected. Lock mechanisms and exception handling are standard. No backdoors or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is well-structured, with clear separation of concerns, proper configuration management, and standard telemetry data flows. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or embedded secrets are present. Network communication is used solely for telemetry, which is typical for such monitoring tools. The security risk is minimal, primarily operational, related to network endpoints and configuration. The malware score is appropriate at 0, and the obfuscated score at 0, with a low risk score (~0.2) justified by the network features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, purpose-built emissions and energy tracking library with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or backdoors. The observed data flows and features are standard for telemetry tools. The current scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: ~0.2) are justified and appropriate.",
