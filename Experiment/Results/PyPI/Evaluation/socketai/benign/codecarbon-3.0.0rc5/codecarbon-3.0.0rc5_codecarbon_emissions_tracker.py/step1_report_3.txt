  "purpose": "Implementations of APIs and decorators for tracking and measuring emissions and power consumption in Python applications, including online and offline modes.",
  "sources": "Configuration reading via get_hierarchical_config(), environment variables (e.g., os.environ.get('CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES')), and function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Emission data handlers (FileOutput, HTTPOutput, etc.), logging outputs, API endpoints, and data serialization for emissions and energy metrics.",
  "flows": "Data flows from hardware measurement and environment/config inputs to emission calculations, then to various output handlers such as files, APIs, or logs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of the _sentinel object for default argument detection; multiple config and environment variable reads; no evident hardcoded secrets or credentials; dynamic tracking logic and decorators are standard; no obfuscated code or suspicious code execution patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides emission tracking functionalities with methods to initialize, start, stop, and persist data, along with decorators for ease of use. It reads configuration from environment variables and files, manages hardware power measurement, and sends data to multiple outputs. No malicious behaviors such as network data exfiltration, backdoors, or sabotage are evident. Usage of environment variables and configuration files for sensitive data is typical and does not indicate malicious intent. The dynamic creation of output handlers and multiple modes (online/offline) appear legitimate and aligned with intended functionality. No obfuscated code or suspicious code execution patterns were identified. The code does contain standard security considerations like lock management and exception suppression for robustness, not malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of an emissions tracking library with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It reads configuration data securely, manages emissions data effectively, and provides flexible output options. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks were detected.",
