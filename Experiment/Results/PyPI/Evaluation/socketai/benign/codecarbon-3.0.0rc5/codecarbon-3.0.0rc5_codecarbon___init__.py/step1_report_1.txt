{
  "purpose": "This module serves as an API for the Carbon Tracker, exposing version info and tracking classes/functions related to emissions monitoring.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (_version and emissions_tracker), and the assignment of __all__ and __app_name__ variables.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks or places where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "The imports and variable assignments do not involve untrusted data sources; there are no data flows from external input to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code, or unusual variable usage.",
  "analysis": "The code solely imports version info and tracker classes, then defines exportable symbols and application name. It does not include any data processing, external input handling, or executable code that could pose security risks. The structure is straightforward and typical for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign package initializer for a Python library related to emissions tracking. No malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks are evident.",
