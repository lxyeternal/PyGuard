{
  "purpose": "This code defines the public API for the Carbon Tracker module, importing version information and tracker classes/functions for emissions tracking.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (_version and emissions_tracker), setting __all__ and __app_name__ variables.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or could cause harm.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows present; code only performs static imports and variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs identified.",
  "analysis": "The code solely imports version info and emissions tracker classes/functions, then defines exported symbols and app name. It does not process user input, execute dynamic code, or interact with external systems. There are no hardcoded credentials, network connections, or data leaks. The structure and content are straightforward and typical for a Python package's __init__.py or API module.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module API definition with no malicious behavior, no security risks identified, and no obfuscation. It functions purely as a package interface.",
