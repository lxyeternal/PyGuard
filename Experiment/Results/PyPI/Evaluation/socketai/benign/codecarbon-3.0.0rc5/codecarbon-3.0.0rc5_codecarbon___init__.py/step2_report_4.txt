  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code is a typical Python package initializer (`__init__.py`-like file).\n- It imports version info (`__version__`) and emissions tracking classes/functions (`EmissionsTracker`, `OfflineEmissionsTracker`, `track_emissions`) from internal modules.\n- It defines `__all__` to specify the public API.\n- It sets `__app_name__` to \"codecarbon\".\n- The code is static, straightforward, and does not process external data or perform any dynamic operations.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the presence of issues:\n- **Issues in the code?**  \n  **No.** The code is simple, standard, and does not contain any suspicious or malicious constructs.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- **Logical or security flaws?**  \n  **None.** The code is a typical API exposure pattern with no evident vulnerabilities.\n\n### Scores and their appropriateness:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`. Given the code's simplicity and lack of any malicious activity, this is correct.\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`. The code is clear, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:**  \n  All reports assign very low (0 or 0.1). The code is benign; thus, these scores are appropriate.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- No, the code does not warrant a higher risk score. It only exposes internal classes and version info.\n\n### Consistency with report claims:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, with no suspicious activity, no external data handling, and no malicious intent.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- Since the code is a standard package API setup, there is no indication of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risk identified)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus in the reports.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign, straightforward package initializer exposing version info and tracking classes/functions. No security issues, malware, or obfuscation are present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as they are.",
