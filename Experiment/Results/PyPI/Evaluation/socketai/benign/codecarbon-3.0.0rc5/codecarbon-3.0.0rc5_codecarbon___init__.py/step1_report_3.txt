{
  "purpose": "This module serves as an API interface for the Carbon Tracker, exposing version information and emissions tracking classes and functions.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (_version and emissions_tracker), which read version info and tracking functionalities.",
  "sinks": "No explicit untrusted data handling or external data outputs; no sinks identified that could leak data or cause side effects.",
  "flows": "The module imports version info and tracker classes/functions, then exposes them via __all__, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, unusual code constructs, or suspicious logic present. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports internal version info and tracker classes, then defines the public API via __all__ and sets a module name. All operations are static and involve no user input or external communications. There are no malicious or suspicious behaviors detected, nor any security risks evident from this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module initialization file exposing selected API components with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
