{
  "purpose": "This module serves as an API interface for the Carbon Tracker package, exposing version information and emissions tracking classes/functions.",
  "sources": "Import statements for internal version info and emissions tracker classes/functions",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or outputs; no external data handling or network operations",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only sets up exports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard import and export statements, no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution",
  "analysis": "The code imports version info and classes/functions related to emissions tracking from internal modules. It defines __all__ for public API exposure and sets a module-level variable __app_name__. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious logic, or external data handling. The structure appears straightforward and typical for a Python package __init__.py file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup for a Python package, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It only defines exports and metadata.",
