  "purpose": "Initialize the package by importing version info and emissions tracking classes/functions, and expose them via __all__ for public API.",
  "sources": "Import statements for __version__, EmissionsTracker, OfflineEmissionsTracker, track_emissions",
  "sinks": "None; static import and variable assignment without external data or untrusted input",
  "flows": "Import of version and tracker classes/functions -> __all__ and __app_name__ definitions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static code with no obfuscated or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard __init__.py module that imports version info and tracker classes/functions, then defines __all__ and __app_name__. It contains no external input handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with the benign and static nature of the code. Given the simplicity and clarity, the code poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package initializer with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate; malware and obfuscated scores should remain 0, and risk score can be 0 or 0.1. Overall, the code is safe and standard for a Python package's API setup.",
