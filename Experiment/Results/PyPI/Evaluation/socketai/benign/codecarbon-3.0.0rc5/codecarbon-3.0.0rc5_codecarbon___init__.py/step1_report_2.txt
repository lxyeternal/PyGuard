{
  "purpose": "This module appears to define and export classes and functions related to emissions tracking within the Carbon Tracker package, serving as part of the public API.",
  "sources": "Import of internal modules (_version and emissions_tracker), and the setting of __all__ and __app_name__ variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present. The code does not process external input or output data directly.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks, as the code mainly imports and defines public API exports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The code consists of straightforward imports and variable assignments.",
  "analysis": "The code imports version information and tracker classes/functions from internal modules, then defines the public API via __all__ and sets an application name. There are no input/output handling, data processing, or security-sensitive operations. It appears to be a standard module initialization script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical module initializer for a Python package, exposing certain classes and functions for external use. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
