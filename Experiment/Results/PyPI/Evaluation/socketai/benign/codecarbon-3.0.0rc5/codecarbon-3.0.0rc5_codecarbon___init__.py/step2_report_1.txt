  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward package initializer (__init__.py) that imports internal modules, exposes certain classes/functions via __all__, and sets a package name.\n- No external input handling, data processing, or network operations are present.\n- No suspicious, obfuscated, or malicious code patterns are identified.\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, and security risk scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1).\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code matches the description: it only imports version info and tracker classes/functions, then defines __all__ and __app_name__.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, external data leaks, or obfuscated code.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n- The security assessments are appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n\n### Scores:\n- Malware: 0 across all reports. This is justified; no malicious code or behavior is present.\n- Obfuscated: 0, which is correct.\n- Risk: Mostly 0 or 0.1, reflecting minimal security concern. Given the code's nature, these are reasonable.\n\n### Justification for higher scores:\n- No higher scores are warranted. The code is benign and static.\n\n### Potential assumptions or vulnerabilities:\n- The reports correctly identify that there are no external inputs, dynamic code, or secrets.\n- No claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a typical __init__.py for a Python package exposing public API components.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security risk factors are evident.\n\n### My estimated scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (or possibly 0.1 if considering minimal package setup risk, but 0 is more precise)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code is benign. No adjustments needed.",
