  "conclusion": "Most reports correctly identify benign code with low security risk. Report 2 shows moderate suspicion due to dynamic code and obfuscation, warranting a malware score of 0.5 and a security risk of 0.6. Report 4's scores are justified given the dynamic imports and eval, with a malware score of 0.2 and risk of 0.4. Slightly increasing Report 4's malware score to 0.3 could be considered for caution, but current scores are acceptable. Overall, the scoring aligns with the evidence, and no major adjustments are necessary."
