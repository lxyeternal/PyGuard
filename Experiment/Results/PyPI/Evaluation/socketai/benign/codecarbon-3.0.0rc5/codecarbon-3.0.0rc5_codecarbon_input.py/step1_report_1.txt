{
  "purpose": "The code provides a DataSource class to load various environmental and hardware data from package resources or files, mainly for energy and emissions analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads resource paths from package resource files; loads JSON data files; reads CSV files for emissions and CPU data.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted file paths are opened and read; JSON data and CSV data are loaded from package resources.",
  "flows": "Resource path methods retrieve file paths -> files are opened -> data is loaded into memory (json.load or pandas.read_csv).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; resource paths are dynamically generated based on configuration; no suspicious or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically accesses package resources using standard importlib_resources functions, loads JSON and CSV data for environmental and hardware metrics, and provides utility methods for data access. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present. No network or system commands executed. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic detected. Resource handling is straightforward, with proper cleanup via ExitStack. No signs of malware, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or system modification. The only potential concern is if resource paths are manipulated externally, but given the context, this appears safe and typical for resource management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard resource management and data loading utility with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be well-structured, secure, and appropriate for its purpose.",
