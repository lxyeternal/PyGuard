{
  "purpose": "Provides access to various data resources including JSON and CSV files for environmental and hardware data, primarily for energy and emissions analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration from a hardcoded dictionary, resource paths from package resources, and opens JSON/CSV files using open() and pandas.read_csv().",
  "sinks": "Uses open() and pandas.read_csv() to load data; no direct untrusted data sinks such as network sockets or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "Data is read from resource files via get_ressource_path() which resolves package resources, then loaded into Python data structures (JSON or DataFrame). No external untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets detected. The code relies on package resource paths and local files, with no dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic. Exception handling is minimal but appropriate.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly manages static resource files within a package, providing methods to access data files like JSON and CSV formats. No external input or untrusted data sources are processed. It uses standard library functions for resource management and data loading. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection are present. Overall, the code appears straightforward and safe, primarily focused on data access.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard resource handler for data files within a package, with no indications of malicious intent or malware. It performs predictable, safe data loading tasks without external inputs or network activity. Security risks are minimal, mainly related to the handling of local files, which do not appear malicious.",
