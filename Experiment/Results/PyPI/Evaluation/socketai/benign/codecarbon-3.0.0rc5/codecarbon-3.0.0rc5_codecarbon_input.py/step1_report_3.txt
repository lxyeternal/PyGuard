{
  "purpose": "Provides access to various data files and resources related to energy, emissions, and hardware information within a package.",
  "sources": "Reads from package resource files using importlib.resources and open() for JSON files, as well as reading CSV files with pandas.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that process untrusted data in a harmful way are present; the code primarily loads data from package resources.",
  "flows": "Resource paths are obtained via importlib.resources; JSON and CSV files are read into data structures without involving untrusted input; no external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code adheres to standard resource loading practices.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for accessing resource files embedded within a Python package, using standard library functions. It loads JSON and CSV data from internal package resources. No external input handling or network operations are present. The resource management employs context managers and exit stack properly. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are found. The class appears to serve as a utility for data access without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward resource loader for data files embedded within a package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It uses standard practices for resource access and data loading, and no suspicious or malicious code segments are present.",
