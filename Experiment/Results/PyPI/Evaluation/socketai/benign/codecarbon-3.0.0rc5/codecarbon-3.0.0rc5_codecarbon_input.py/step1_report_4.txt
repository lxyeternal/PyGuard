{
  "purpose": "The code provides a DataSource class for managing access to various resource files and URLs related to environmental impact data, including methods to load JSON and CSV data.",
  "sources": "Reads data from resource files located within the package, including JSON and CSV files; reads URL string for geo-js script.",
  "sinks": "Potentially insecure use of resource files and URL strings; no direct untrusted input handling or network connections initiated from untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "The code loads data from resource files into memory (json.load, pd.read_csv). The URL is returned as a string for external use but is not fetched or executed directly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. The resource management and data loading appear straightforward. No obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "analysis": "The class manages resource paths for data files using importlib_resources and loads data via standard Python json and pandas functions. The URL is hardcoded but used only as a string. No network requests, code execution, or data exfiltration present. Error handling is minimal but appropriate for missing data files. Overall, the code appears to be a benign data access utility with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward resource management class for environmental data with no indications of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It does not perform any network activity, execute untrusted code, or handle sensitive credentials. The security risk is negligible.",
