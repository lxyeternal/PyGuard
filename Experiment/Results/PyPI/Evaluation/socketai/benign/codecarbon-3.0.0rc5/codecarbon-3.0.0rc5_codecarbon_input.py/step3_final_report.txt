{
  "purpose": "This code manages access to static resource files embedded within a package, providing methods to retrieve paths and load data such as JSON and CSV files related to energy, emissions, and hardware information.",
  "sources": "File system via importlib.resources functions, reading JSON and CSV files, and returning a URL string.",
  "sinks": "No external untrusted data sinks; data is loaded into memory or returned as strings.",
  "flows": "Resource paths are constructed from configuration, then used to open files with standard open/read functions; no external data flows or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; resource management is standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard library functions to access package resources, load JSON and CSV data, and handle exceptions for missing data paths. There is no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. The resource paths are internally defined and used solely for data access. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign resource loader for package-internal data files, with no malicious intent or security risks. The security and malware scores should remain at 0, and the risk score is appropriately low (~0.1), reflecting minimal inherent risk in static resource management.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
