{
  "purpose": "Provides access to various data files and resources related to energy, emissions, and hardware data for a project focused on environmental impact analysis.",
  "sources": "Resource loading functions, especially get_ressource_path and file opening methods that read JSON and CSV files from package resources or filesystem.",
  "sinks": "Reading from resource paths and files; no untrusted input directly processed or written; no network sinks or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Resource paths are generated via get_ressource_path; data is read from JSON and CSV files without user input or external data injection; data is returned as Python dicts or pandas DataFrames.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, no hardcoded secrets beyond URLs or file paths which are benign. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages static resource paths and reads data files (JSON and CSV). It uses standard libraries for resource management and file I/O. No user input handling or external network communications beyond fetching a URL for geo-location. No suspicious or malicious logic, backdoors, or hidden behaviors identified. The only potentially noteworthy aspect is the use of package resources for data access, which is a standard practice. No hardcoded credentials or secret tokens. The code appears to be a legitimate data access layer for a larger environmental impact application.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily handling resource path resolution and data file reading. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident. It follows standard practices for resource management and data loading. Confidence in this assessment is high.",
