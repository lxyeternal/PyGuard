  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** The report correctly identifies that the code computes emissions from multiple data sources, with fallbacks, and external API calls for private infra. No suspicious data flows or untrusted inputs are detected.\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are observed. External API token is optional, used responsibly.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** The assessment that the code is legitimate with no malicious behavior and a malware score of 0 is justified. The confidence level (0.9) aligns with the thoroughness.\n\n**Verdict:** **Scores are reasonable.** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Similar to Report 1, it notes external data sources and API calls, with fallback mechanisms. No suspicious network activity or data exfiltration is evident.\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** External API token is optional, no obfuscation, no secrets embedded.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** The malware score of 0 is appropriate, given the lack of malicious indicators. The reasoning is sound.\n\n**Verdict:** **Scores are appropriate.** No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Correctly describes data retrieval, fallback logic, and calculations. No suspicious activity.\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. External API use is controlled.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** The malware score of 0 is justified. The reasoning aligns with the code’s behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** **Scores are reasonable.** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Accurately details data sources, external API calls, and calculations. No suspicious network activity or data leaks.\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No secrets or obfuscation; API token is optional.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** Malware score of 0 is justified, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** **Scores are appropriate.** No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Correctly identifies data retrieval, calculations, and API interactions. No suspicious activity.\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** Malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** **Scores are reasonable.** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a 0, which is consistent with the code’s behavior. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly assign 0.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly above zero (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal security risk due to external API calls and data handling, which is reasonable.\n\n### My Final Assessment:\n\nGiven the detailed review, I concur with the scores assigned in all reports. The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured environmental emissions calculator with no malicious intent or behavior.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** ~0.2 (consistent with reports)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, with no malicious or suspicious elements detected.",
