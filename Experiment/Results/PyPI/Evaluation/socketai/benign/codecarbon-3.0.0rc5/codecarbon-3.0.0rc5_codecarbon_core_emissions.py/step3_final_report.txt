{
  "purpose": "Calculates CO2 emissions for cloud and private infrastructure based on energy consumption, regional, and country data, with optional external API calls for private emissions.",
  "sources": "Data retrieved from self._data_source methods (cloud emissions data, country emissions data, energy mix data), and optional API call to co2_signal.get_emissions with an API token.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data exfiltration points; data flows are for calculations and logging only.",
  "flows": "Data sources feed into emissions calculations; external API (if token provided) supplies private infrastructure emissions; fallback mechanisms use country or regional data; logs record missing data scenarios.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; external API token is optional and used responsibly.",
  "analysis": "The code performs emissions calculations using multiple data sources with fallback options, handles exceptions properly, and uses optional external API calls guarded by token presence. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. External API interactions are controlled and do not involve suspicious network activity. The code structure is clear, and no obfuscation is present. The malware score is justified as 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting minimal threat from external dependencies and data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate environmental impact calculator with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. External API usage is controlled and optional. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.2 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
