{
  "purpose": "Provides functionality to compute CO2 emissions for cloud and private infrastructure based on energy consumption and regional energy data.",
  "sources": "Data reads occur via methods such as self._data_source.get_cloud_emissions_data(), self._data_source.get_country_emissions_data(), self._data_source.get_country_energy_mix_data(), self._data_source.get_global_energy_mix_data(), and external calls like co2_signal.get_emissions().",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data such as emissions data and regional energy metrics. No direct sinks for untrusted input are evident; data outputs are for calculations and logs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from data source methods into emission calculations, with conditional fallbacks to regional or country emission data, and external API calls for private infrastructure emissions. No untrusted data is directly used in execution paths that affect system state outside calculations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns identified. External API token is optionally used. Logging for errors and warnings is present but standard. No obfuscated code, unusual language features, or misleading variable names detected.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes multiple data sources for emission calculations, handling exceptions with fallbacks to default data. It fetches regional and country energy data, computes weighted emissions, and optionally calls external API for private infrastructure emissions. No evidence of malicious code, such as network exfiltration, system modification, or data theft, is present. The external API call respects an optional token, indicating controlled external interaction. Logging and exception handling appear standard and non-malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a legitimate emissions calculation module with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected. It securely reads data, performs calculations, and logs issues appropriately. No malware or malicious intent is apparent; the code appears safe for use.",
