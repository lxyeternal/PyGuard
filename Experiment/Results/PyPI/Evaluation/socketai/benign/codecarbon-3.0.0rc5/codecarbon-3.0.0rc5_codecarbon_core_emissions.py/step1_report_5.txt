{
  "purpose": "Provides functionality to compute emissions for cloud and private infrastructure based on impact and energy usage data.",
  "sources": "Data is read from self._data_source.get_cloud_emissions_data(), self._data_source.get_country_emissions_data(), self._data_source.get_country_energy_mix_data(), self._data_source.get_global_energy_mix_data(), and external APIs like co2_signal.get_emissions().",
  "sinks": "Data is used internally for calculations and returned as float emissions values; no data is sent elsewhere in this code.",
  "flows": "Input energy and geo data are read from method parameters; data is retrieved from data sources; emissions are calculated and returned; external API may be called to get private emissions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. Logging is standard, and external API calls are used responsibly with exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs data retrieval and calculations based on energy and geographic data. It uses well-defined data sources and external API calls with exception handling. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or malicious behaviors are present. The API token, if provided, is used for legitimate API access, with fallback mechanisms. All data flows are internal and for emissions calculations, with no signs of data exfiltration or malicious intent. The code is consistent with typical energy/emissions analysis modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, security-conscious implementation for computing emissions data. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware signals are detected. The usage of external APIs and data sources is standard and appropriately handled with exception management.",
