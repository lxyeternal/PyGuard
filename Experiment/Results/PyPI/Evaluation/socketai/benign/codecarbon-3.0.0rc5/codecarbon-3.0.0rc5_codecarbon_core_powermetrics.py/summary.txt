  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate system utility for monitoring power consumption on Apple Silicon Macs. It does not contain malicious or obfuscated code. The use of 'sudo' is necessary for hardware data collection but should be managed carefully. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score is justified as zero. The reports' assessments are accurate and appropriate."
