{
  "purpose": "Provides import statements for various output methods related to data persistence and emissions tracking in the codecarbon library.",
  "sources": "Import statements from multiple codecarbon.output_methods modules, importing classes and functions for data handling and output.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data are present; the code only imports modules without executing or processing data.",
  "flows": "No active data flow or processing is visible; the code is solely import statements with no data manipulation or transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets detected. The comments and import structure are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of import statements from the 'codecarbon.output_methods' package, importing various classes for output handling. There are no functions, data processing, or network operations shown. The imports are used for data output to files, HTTP endpoints, loggers, and metrics. No malicious behavior or suspicious activities are evident; the code appears to be part of a larger framework setup. The lack of executable code, data handling, or network communication in this fragment limits any potential malicious activity suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a standard set of import statements intended for a data persistence module within the codecarbon package. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or security risks in this snippet. It appears benign and solely sets up dependencies for other parts of the system.",
