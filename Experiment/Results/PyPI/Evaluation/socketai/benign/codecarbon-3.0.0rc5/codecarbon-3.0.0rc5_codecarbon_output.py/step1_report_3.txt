{
  "purpose": "Provides import statements for various output methods related to data persistence and reporting in the codecarbon package.",
  "sources": "Import statements that load classes and functions from other modules within the package.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or external data processing observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis needed; this code only imports modules without executing data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for classes and functions related to data output and metrics reporting. There are no function calls, data processing, or data handling here. All imports are from internal modules, and the purpose appears to be modular inclusion of output methods. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The code does not contain any data flows, user inputs, or external connections; it simply sets up dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of import statements for various output modules within the package. It shows no malicious intent, no anomalous or suspicious activity, and no security risks. Overall, the code appears safe and intended for modular functionality.",
