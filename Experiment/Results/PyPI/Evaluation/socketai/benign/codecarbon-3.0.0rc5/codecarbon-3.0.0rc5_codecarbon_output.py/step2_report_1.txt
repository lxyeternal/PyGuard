  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the purpose, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Assessment:** The code contains only import statements from a legitimate package ('codecarbon.output_methods') related to environmental data tracking.  \n- **Malware, obfuscated code, or vulnerabilities:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Correct. The report is accurate; the code is benign.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, only import statements from the same package, with no data processing or network activity.  \n- **Malware, obfuscated code, or vulnerabilities:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (slightly above zero, possibly due to cautious default).  \n- **Conclusion:** Slightly conservative but acceptable. No issues.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Assessment:** Again, only import statements with no execution or data handling.  \n- **Malware, obfuscated code, or vulnerabilities:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Assessment:** Same pattern—import statements only, no active code or data flow.  \n- **Malware, obfuscated code, or vulnerabilities:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.  \n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Assessment:** Same as others—import statements for output modules.  \n- **Malware, obfuscated code, or vulnerabilities:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; scores are 0.  \n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation detected; scores are 0.  \n- **Risk Score:** Since these are just import statements, the risk is minimal; scores are appropriately low (0 or 0.1).  \n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code snippets are purely static import statements from a well-known, open-source package.  \n- No execution, data transmission, or suspicious behavior is present.  \n- The slight risk scores (0.1) in some reports are acceptable as conservative estimates, but they could be set to 0 given the benign nature.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.05 (very low, given the static nature and reputable source)\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No further action needed.",
