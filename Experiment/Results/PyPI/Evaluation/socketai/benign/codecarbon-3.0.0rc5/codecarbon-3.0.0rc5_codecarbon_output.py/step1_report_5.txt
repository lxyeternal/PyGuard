{
  "purpose": "This code provides imports for various output methods related to data persistence and reporting, such as files, HTTP endpoints, loggers, and metrics.",
  "sources": "Imports from codecarbon.output_methods and its submodules, which are sources of output data or configuration for output methods.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present in this code; it only imports classes and functions for use elsewhere.",
  "flows": "There are no active data flows; this fragment only sets up imported classes without executing any data transmission or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code consists solely of import statements, with no dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various modules related to output and data persistence, such as file output, HTTP output, logging, and metrics. All imported modules appear to be from a reputable package (codecarbon) focused on environmental data reporting. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network communications, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The use of noqa comments indicates these imports are for future use, not immediate malicious actions. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or security issues are apparent in this static import setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import setup for various output methods within a data persistence module. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears benign and intended for legitimate data reporting purposes.",
