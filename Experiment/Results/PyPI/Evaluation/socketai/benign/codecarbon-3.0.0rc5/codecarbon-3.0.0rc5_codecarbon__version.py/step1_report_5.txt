  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a version string to the __version__ attribute, indicating the package version. There are no inputs, outputs, or complex logic. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The use of a release candidate version is typical for development or pre-release stages. There are no obfuscation techniques, hidden code, or malicious indicators.",
