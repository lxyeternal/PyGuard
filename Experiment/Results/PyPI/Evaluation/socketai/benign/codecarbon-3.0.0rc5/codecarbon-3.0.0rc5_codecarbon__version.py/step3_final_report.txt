  "purpose": "Assigns the version string for the package, indicating its release version.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it is a static assignment of a version string.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leakage.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the assignment is straightforward and static.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of 'rc5' indicates a release candidate, but this is standard in pre-release versions and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple assignment of a version string to __version__, with no inputs, outputs, or executable logic. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The version string '3.0.0_rc5' indicates a release candidate, which is common in development cycles. Scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately set to 0. The confidence level is high, given the straightforward nature of the code. No anomalies or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, representing a standard version declaration. There are no security risks, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation. The current assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
