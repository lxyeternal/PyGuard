{
  "purpose": "Defines the version of the package as '3.0.0_rc5'.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string, no input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data output or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows; only static assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; straightforward version assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a version string to the '__version__' variable. This is a common practice in Python packages to specify the package version. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no code execution, no data handling, and no obfuscated or suspicious constructs. The version string indicates a release candidate, but this does not impact security analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and performs a standard version assignment with no malicious intent or security risks.",
