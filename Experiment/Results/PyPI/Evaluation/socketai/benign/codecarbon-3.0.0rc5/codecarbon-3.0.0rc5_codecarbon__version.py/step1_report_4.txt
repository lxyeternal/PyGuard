{
  "purpose": "Defines the version of the package as '3.0.0_rc5'.",
  "sources": "The code reads a hardcoded version string assigned to __version__.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only a static assignment.",
  "anomalies": "The version string includes a release candidate identifier ('rc5'), which is not inherently suspicious but might be considered unusual for final release code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a version string assignment, which is common in Python packages to specify versioning. There are no inputs, outputs, or data processing logic. No hardcoded secrets, no malicious code, no obfuscated or dynamic code execution. The presence of a release candidate version does not indicate malicious intent but suggests this is a pre-release version. Overall, the code is benign and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version assignment statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard part of package metadata.",
