  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The only potential concern is reliance on an external method, which is justified with a low risk score. Malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal (0.1). The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."
