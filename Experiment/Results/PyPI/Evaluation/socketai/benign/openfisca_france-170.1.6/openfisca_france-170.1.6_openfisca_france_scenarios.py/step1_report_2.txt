  "purpose": "Initialize a scenario with family, household, and individual data structures, and populate them based on provided input parameters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: scenario, axes, enfants, famille, foyer_fiscal, menage, parent1, parent2, period.",
  "sinks": "scenario.init_from_dict(test_data) call potentially executes external code with constructed data.",
  "flows": "Data is assembled into 'test_data' dictionary and passed to 'scenario.init_from_dict' method.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious data flows or external network interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs nested dictionaries representing family and household data, assigns individuals based on input parameters, and calls a scenario initialization method. It does not process untrusted external input directly, nor does it execute any system commands, network operations, or data leaks. The data assembly appears standard for initializing a data model. The only potential concern is the call to 'scenario.init_from_dict', which depends on external implementation but is not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward data initialization routine with no evident malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on well-defined input parameters and a scenario object that is expected to handle the data securely.",
