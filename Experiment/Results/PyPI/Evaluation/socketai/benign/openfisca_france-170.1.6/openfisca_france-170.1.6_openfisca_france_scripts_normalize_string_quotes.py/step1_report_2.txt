  "purpose": "The code appears to normalize and reformat string tokens in Python source files within a project directory.",
  "sources": "Reading Python source files using os.walk and tokenize.generate_tokens.",
  "sinks": "Overwriting original source files with normalized code using open(file_path, 'w') as python_file.",
  "flows": "Reading source files -> Tokenizing and processing string tokens -> Replacing string tokens with normalized forms -> Writing back to source files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external network activity. The code performs file traversal and token processing without external communication. The commented-out code for single-quoted string handling is inactive but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script traverses a project directory, skips hidden files and directories, and processes each Python file. It tokenizes each file's content, reformats string literals (specifically double-quoted strings and docstrings) into a consistent style, then rewrites the source code back to the same file. There are no suspicious network connections, no code injection, or data exfiltration observed. The code modifies source files directly, which is typical for code formatters or linters, not malware. The commented code for single-quoted strings suggests planned or previous additional functionality, but as it is commented out, it does not execute.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a source code normalizer or formatter for Python files, with no indication of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It modifies source files to enforce string formatting consistency. There are no signs of malware or security risks present.",
