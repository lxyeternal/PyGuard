  "purpose": "Traverse a directory tree, tokenize Python files, and normalize string literals by converting double-quoted strings and docstrings into triple single quotes or single quotes, overwriting the original source files.",
  "sources": "File system traversal, reading Python source files, tokenizing source code, regex substitutions on string tokens.",
  "sinks": "Overwriting source files directly without validation or backups.",
  "flows": "Read file -> tokenize -> apply regex substitutions to string tokens -> untokenize -> overwrite original file.",
  "anomalies": "In-place modification of source files without safeguards, no error handling, commented-out regex for single-quoted docstrings which is inactive.",
  "analysis": "The script performs directory traversal, skipping hidden directories (except .github) and hidden files, then processes each Python file by tokenizing its content. It applies regex substitutions to convert double-quoted strings and docstrings into normalized formats, then rewrites the files in-place. No network activity, code execution, or data exfiltration occurs. The regex substitutions are straightforward string manipulations, not malicious. The main concern is the lack of validation or backups, risking source corruption. The code is a benign formatter/normalizer with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is approximately 0.2 due to potential source damage. Overall, the code is low risk and safe, but caution should be exercised when used in production without safeguards.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign source code normalization utility that modifies files in-place without safeguards, posing a risk of source corruption but no malware or malicious behavior. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
