{
  "purpose": "Define entities related to family, individual, household, and tax declaration for a data model.",
  "sources": "Imports from openfisca_core.entities and the build_entity function calls that define entity schemas.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or outputs, no database queries, no external network communications.",
  "flows": "The code solely constructs entity definitions in memory; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. No dynamic execution or data manipulation that suggests malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a well-known library for building data models and defines several entity schemas with attributes such as roles, labels, documentation, and subroles. All roles have clear, descriptive keys and labels. There is no handling of user input, no network calls, and no secret management. The code appears to be straightforward schema definitions without hidden or malicious components.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign definition of data entities related to family and household structures, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
