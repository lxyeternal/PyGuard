{
  "purpose": "Define various entities related to family, individual, fiscal household, and housing for a socio-economic model.",
  "sources": "Imports from openfisca_core.entities and multiple build_entity function calls with parameters.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data; the code primarily defines static data structures and entities.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical functions; the code is configuration-like, establishing entity schemas.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code constructs. The docstrings provide definitions but do not perform any operations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function to build entities and then defines four entities: Famille, Individu, FoyerFiscal, and Menage. Each entity specifies keys, labels, roles, and documentation, following a standard schema pattern. There is no input handling, no data processing, no dynamic code execution, and no network or file operations. The code appears to be a static configuration or data schema setup for a larger application. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected. The structure and content are consistent with legitimate entity definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup of entities for a socio-economic model, with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and standard for its purpose.",
