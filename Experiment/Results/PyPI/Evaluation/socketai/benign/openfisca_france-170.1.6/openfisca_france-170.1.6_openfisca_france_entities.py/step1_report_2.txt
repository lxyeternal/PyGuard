{
  "purpose": "Define entities related to family, individual, household, and tax declaration for a civil or social data model.",
  "sources": "Import of 'build_entity' from 'openfisca_core.entities' and the subsequent calls to build entities.",
  "sinks": "None of the code appears to process untrusted data directly or output data to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; code is purely declarative, defining entities and roles.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code solely constructs entity definitions using a provided 'build_entity' function, with static parameters for keys, labels, roles, and documentation. No user input handling, network communication, or file I/O is present. The code is static, well-structured, and appears to be a schema or data model definition without any suspicious or malicious content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data model setup for entities related to families and individuals. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code's purpose is clearly to define entities and roles with no external or untrusted data manipulation involved.",
