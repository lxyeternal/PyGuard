{
  "purpose": "Defines data entities related to family, individual, fiscal household, and housing for socio-economic modeling.",
  "sources": "Static definitions within the code; no external data input or data reading operations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is declarative schema setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and schema-like with descriptive labels and documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static entity definitions using 'build_entity' from 'openfisca_core.entities'. It contains no dynamic code, input/output operations, network activity, or secrets. The structure is clear, with roles, labels, documentation, and roles' subroles. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present. The code is purely declarative, serving as data schema for socio-economic modeling. No vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or obfuscation are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's nature and are appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static, schema-like setup for socio-economic entities with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scoring is justified. No modifications are necessary.",
