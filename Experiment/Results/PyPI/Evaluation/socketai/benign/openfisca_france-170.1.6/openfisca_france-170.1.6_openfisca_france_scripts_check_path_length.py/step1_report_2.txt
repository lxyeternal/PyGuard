  "purpose": "Check folder paths for length constraints and log paths exceeding 150 characters to prevent issues on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "Reading directory structure with os.walk; reading and writing to 'path_too_long_list.txt'.",
  "sinks": "Writing to 'path_too_long_list.txt'; logging errors with logging.error().",
  "flows": "os.walk provides directory paths; relative_path is constructed; paths exceeding 150 characters are logged and written to file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or hidden malicious actions detected. The code performs straightforward path length checking and logging.",
  "analysis": "The script performs directory traversal using os.walk to check for overly long paths, logs errors, and writes such paths to a file. It explicitly ignores hidden files and directories. No network activity, no dynamic code execution, no credential handling, or other malicious behaviors are present. The code is well-structured, with no obfuscation, and uses standard library functions. It does not contain any backdoors or malicious code segments. The purpose is purely to enforce path length constraints, particularly for Windows compatibility, and it exits with code 1 if issues are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and intended for path length validation. It does not contain malware or malicious intent. No security risks are identified beyond the purpose of path length checking.",
