  "purpose": "Load and parse the JSON file 'couple.json' located in the same directory as the script.",
  "sources": "Reading the file 'couple.json' via open() and passing its contents to json.loads().",
  "sinks": "Parsed data stored in the variable 'couple'; potential data leakage if the JSON contains sensitive information.",
  "flows": "Construct file path -> open file -> read contents -> json.loads() -> store in 'couple'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; straightforward file I/O and JSON parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a file path relative to the script's directory, opens the specified JSON file, reads its contents, and parses it into a Python object. It uses standard library functions with no obfuscation or malicious constructs. The only potential concern is if the JSON file is maliciously crafted, which could cause parsing errors or resource exhaustion, but this is a general risk with untrusted data, not a flaw in the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign utility for loading JSON data from a local file. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk score (around 0.0 to 0.1) is appropriate, primarily reflecting the potential for malicious JSON content, which is outside the scope of static code analysis.",
