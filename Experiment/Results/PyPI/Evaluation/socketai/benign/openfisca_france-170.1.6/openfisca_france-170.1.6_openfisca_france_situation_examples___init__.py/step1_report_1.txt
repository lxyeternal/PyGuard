  "purpose": "Load and parse a JSON file named 'couple.json' located in the same directory as the script.",
  "sources": "Reading the file 'couple.json' from the filesystem via open() and json.loads()",
  "sinks": "Data loaded into the 'couple' variable, potential data leakage if the file contains sensitive information",
  "flows": "File path construction using DIR_PATH and file_name -> file reading -> json parsing -> data stored in 'couple'",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code present",
  "analysis": "The script defines a directory path based on the script's location, then reads a JSON file with a specified filename. It uses standard library functions for file I/O and JSON parsing. No external input apart from the filename is used, and the data is stored locally. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a straightforward JSON file read operation without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is a simple utility function for loading data.",
