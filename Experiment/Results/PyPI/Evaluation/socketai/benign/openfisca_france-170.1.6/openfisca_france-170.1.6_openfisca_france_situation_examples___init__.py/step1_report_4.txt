{
  "purpose": "The code reads and parses a JSON file named 'couple.json' located in the same directory as the script.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a file specified by 'file_name' argument, constructed based on the script's directory.",
  "sinks": "The code uses json.loads() on the file contents, which could potentially execute malicious JSON if the file is maliciously crafted, but no external output or command execution occurs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the file read ('file.read()') into json.loads(), which parses the JSON data into Python objects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code performs standard file reading and JSON parsing without unusual constructs or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a function to parse a JSON file located in the same directory. It constructs the file path safely using os.path functions and reads the content without executing any code. The JSON parsing is standard. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data flows. The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious actions. Overall, the code appears to be a simple utility for loading JSON data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and performs a basic JSON file load operation. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or security risks. It is a benign utility function.",
