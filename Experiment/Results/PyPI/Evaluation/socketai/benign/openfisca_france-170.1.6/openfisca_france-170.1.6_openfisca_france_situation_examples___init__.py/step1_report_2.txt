{
  "purpose": "Load and parse a JSON file named 'couple.json' located in the same directory as the script.",
  "sources": "The function parse reads data from a file specified by file_name, which is combined with the script's directory path.",
  "sinks": "The json.loads function processes the file contents, which could be unsafe if the JSON data is maliciously crafted.",
  "flows": "parse function reads the file content from 'couple.json' and passes it directly to json.loads for parsing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns. The code uses dynamic file paths but does not perform any dangerous operations. No obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to read and parse a JSON file from a directory relative to the script's location. It then loads 'couple.json'. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command execution, or hidden backdoors. The code performs standard file reading and JSON parsing, which are common operations and do not pose security risks by themselves. Since no untrusted input is handled from external sources (e.g., network), the primary concern is if 'couple.json' is maliciously crafted, but this is a normal use case. Overall, the code is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, standard JSON file reader and parser with no evident malicious intent or security risks. It reads data from a local file and parses it, which is a common pattern.",
