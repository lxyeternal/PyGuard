{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script intended for data processing or utility functions, with no explicit indication of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from variables, function parameters, and possibly environment variables if used.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes output to files, console, or network if present; no explicit network or file operations shown.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to outputs; no suspicious or unexpected data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs detected. No backdoors or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with clear logic and standard library usage. No suspicious behaviors such as code injection, data exfiltration, or system modification are present. The absence of network operations or environment manipulation reduces risk. The code structure and syntax are normal, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious modifications.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code appears benign and safe for use.",
