{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python script intended for data processing or automation, but without explicit comments or context, the exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are not explicitly present; the code reads from files or standard input if applicable, but these are not visible in the snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include network connections, file writes, or subprocess calls if they exist in the unseen code, but none are explicitly shown here.",
  "flows": "No identifiable source-to-sink data flow is observable from the provided code snippet due to its incomplete nature.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns are evident. The code appears straightforward, with standard function definitions and control flow.",
  "analysis": "The snippet lacks concrete data sources or sinks, making it difficult to analyze specific data flows. No signs of malicious intent, such as network connections to suspicious domains, code injection, or backdoors, are present. The code structure appears typical for a Python script, and no insecure patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or significant security risks. The code appears benign, but incomplete context prevents full assurance.",
