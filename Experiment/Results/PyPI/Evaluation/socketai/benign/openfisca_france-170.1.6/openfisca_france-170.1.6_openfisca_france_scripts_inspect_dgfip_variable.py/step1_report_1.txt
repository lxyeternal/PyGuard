{
  "purpose": "Open a specific variable page on the DGFIP website in a web browser, based on user input and optional year range.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments for variable name, year, and browser; environment variables for the browser setting; user input parsed via argparse.",
  "sinks": "webbrowser.get() and browser.open_new_tab() to open URLs in a user-specified or default browser.",
  "flows": "User provides variable name and optional year range -> validate inputs -> construct URL -> open URL in browser.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; straightforward URL construction and web browser invocation.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily parses user inputs, validates them, and constructs a URL to open in a web browser. It uses regex for input validation, and the URL is built from trusted static parts combined with user inputs. The webbrowser module is used to open URLs, which is a standard practice. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The code does not perform any network requests besides opening a URL in the browser, nor does it execute untrusted code. The purpose appears purely to facilitate user navigation on a website. Overall, the code is simple, well-structured, and free of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a command-line utility to open specific DGFIP website pages in a web browser. It contains no malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. It relies on standard Python modules and user inputs without any suspicious operations. Security risks are minimal and typical for a script of this nature.",
