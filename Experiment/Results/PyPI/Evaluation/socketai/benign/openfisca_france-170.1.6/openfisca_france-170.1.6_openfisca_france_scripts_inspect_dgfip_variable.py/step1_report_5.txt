{
  "purpose": "Open a specified variable on the DGFIP website in a browser for user inspection.",
  "sources": "Input arguments: variable_name, browser_name, min_year, max_year, year; potentially user-provided data via command line.",
  "sinks": "webbrowser.get().open_new_tab(url) which opens a URL in the specified browser.",
  "flows": "Input arguments -> inspect_dgfip_variable() constructs URL -> browser.open_new_tab() opens the URL.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious external network connections, no data exfiltration, no backdoors. The code dynamically opens web pages based on user input but does not perform any malicious network activity or data collection.",
  "analysis": "The script mainly processes command-line arguments to generate URLs based on a variable and year(s). It validates the variable format and constructs URLs pointing to the DGFIP website, opening them in the specified web browser. The flow is straightforward, involving input validation, URL construction, and browser invocation. No suspicious code patterns, malicious functions, or hidden behaviors are present. The code does not perform any data exfiltration, malicious network connections, or system tampering. The use of webbrowser to open URLs is benign and aligned with its intended purpose. Overall, there are no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior, and the code appears to be a harmless utility script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe utility for opening specific web pages based on user input; it contains no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It merely constructs URLs and opens them in a web browser, with proper validation of inputs. Therefore, it poses no security threat.",
