  "purpose": "A command-line utility that constructs URLs based on user input and opens them in a web browser to inspect specific variables on the DGFIP website.",
  "sources": "User input variable name, command-line arguments for year and browser choice",
  "sinks": "webbrowser.open_new_tab() to open constructed URLs in the default or specified browser",
  "flows": "Input variable name and year → URL construction with validation → URL passed to webbrowser to open in browser",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward URL construction and validation, no suspicious code or hidden behavior",
  "analysis": "The code performs input validation on the variable name, constructs URLs based on validated input and specified year, and opens these URLs in a web browser. It uses standard modules and practices, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data leakage. The logic is clear, and the URL construction is safe given the validation. No hardcoded secrets or network activity beyond opening URLs are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for opening specific web pages based on user input, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores and assessments in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
