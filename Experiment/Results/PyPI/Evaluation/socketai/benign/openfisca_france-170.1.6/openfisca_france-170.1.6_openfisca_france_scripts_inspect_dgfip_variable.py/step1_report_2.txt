{
  "purpose": "Open a specific variable page on the DGFIP website in a web browser for inspection.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'variable_name', 'year', 'browser_name'. Also reads environment variables indirectly through os and command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "webbrowser.get() and browser.open_new_tab() - opens a URL in the specified browser; no direct data exfiltration or system modification.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated, then used to construct a URL, which is opened in a web browser.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The code merely constructs URLs based on validated inputs. No network communication other than opening URLs. No code execution or data exfiltration detected.",
  "analysis": "The script parses command-line arguments, validates a variable name with a regex, and constructs URLs to specific web pages based on the input. It uses 'webbrowser' to open URLs in a user-specified browser. All data inputs are limited to expected formats, with no dynamic code execution or network communication other than URL opening. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code behaviors are evident. The purpose appears to be benign automation of web navigation, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility script for opening web pages based on validated inputs. It does not contain malware or security risks. It safely constructs URLs and opens them in a specified browser without any malicious actions.",
