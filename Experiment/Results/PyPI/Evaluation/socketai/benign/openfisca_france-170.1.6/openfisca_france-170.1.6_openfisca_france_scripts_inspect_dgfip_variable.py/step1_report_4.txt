{
  "purpose": "Open a specific variable page on the DGFIP website in a web browser for user inspection.",
  "sources": "User input from command line arguments (variable_name, year, browser_name, min_year, max_year).",
  "sinks": "webbrowser.get(browser_name).open_new_tab(url) to open the constructed URL in a specified browser.",
  "flows": "User provides variable_name and optional year parameters → URL is constructed based on input → webbrowser opens the URL in the specified browser.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code patterns. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs. The script performs URL construction and opens a web browser; this is benign behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script validates the variable name format, constructs a URL based on predefined mappings, and opens this URL in a user-specified browser. It uses command-line arguments for user input, with standard URL and argument handling. No data is being transmitted or received over the network beyond opening a web page. No file operations, code injection, or data exfiltration present. The purpose is straightforward URL opening for user inspection. The code structure and functions are typical and do not show signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility designed to open specific web pages based on user input. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. No anomalies or malicious activities are detected.",
