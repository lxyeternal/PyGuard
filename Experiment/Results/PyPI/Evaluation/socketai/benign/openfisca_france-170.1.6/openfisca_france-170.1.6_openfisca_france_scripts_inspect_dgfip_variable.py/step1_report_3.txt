  "purpose": "Open a specified variable's webpage on the DGFIP website in a web browser for inspection purposes.",
  "sources": "User input via command line arguments (variable name, browser, year range).",
  "sinks": "webbrowser.get().open_new_tab() - opening a URL in a browser.",
  "flows": "User provides variable name and optional year range -> inspect_dgfip_variable constructs URL -> webbrowser opens URL in specified browser.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. The code relies on user input to open URLs and does not process or transmit untrusted data beyond URL construction.",
  "analysis": "The script takes user input for variable name, year, and browser. It constructs a URL based on these inputs to open a webpage. There are input validations to ensure variable format correctness and section handling. No code injection, data leakage, or network activity beyond opening a URL is evident. The script uses standard modules and webbrowser for URL opening, which is generally safe. No obfuscated code or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a utility for opening specific webpages based on user input. It performs input validation but does not contain malicious or suspicious code. The primary action is opening URLs in a browser, which is typical for such scripts. No signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks found.",
