  "flows": "Import of 'FranceTaxBenefitSystem' into the namespace, assignment to 'CountryTaxBenefitSystem'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and assignment; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, standard Python import and assignment from a reputable open-source package. No dynamic code execution, data processing, or network activity is present. The package is domain-specific and publicly available. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are detected. The import is typical for modular codebases, and the assignment does not introduce any security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals indicate a safe, standard import statement from a trusted package.",
