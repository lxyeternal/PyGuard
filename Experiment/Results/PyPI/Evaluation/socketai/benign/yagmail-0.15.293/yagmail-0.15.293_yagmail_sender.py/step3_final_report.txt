  "purpose": "A Python SMTP wrapper supporting OAuth2, email validation, and message preparation for sending emails.",
  "sources": "User input addresses, credentials, OAuth2 info, environment variables, and message content.",
  "sinks": "smtplib's sendmail function, OAuth token exchange, and message transmission over network.",
  "flows": "Input addresses and credentials flow into message preparation and SMTP sendmail; OAuth2 info flows into authentication steps.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, comments about BCC handling are only in comments without actual implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard SMTP email sender with OAuth2 support, email validation, and retry logic. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. Comments about BCC are benign and do not reflect actual malicious intent. The code handles credentials dynamically, uses standard libraries, and includes error handling and logging. No obfuscation or hardcoded secrets are detected. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to credential handling, which is typical for such utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign SMTP email sender with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The current malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score can be considered very low (~0.1). The scores in the original reports are appropriate; however, the security risk could be conservatively lowered to 0 given the benign nature of the code.",
