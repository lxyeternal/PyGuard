  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to determine the presence of issues, the appropriateness of scores, and any potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a SMTP wrapper with OAuth2, email validation, and message handling. Inputs are standard user-provided email addresses, credentials, and environment info.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uses smtplib to send emails; credentials handled securely; email addresses validated.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate SMTP wrapper with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's features. The scores seem appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar SMTP wrapper supporting OAuth2, with user inputs for addresses and credentials.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows into message preparation and SMTP sendmail; credentials handled dynamically.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard email-sending code, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The risk score of 0.2 reflects a low but non-zero concern—possibly due to handling credentials or network communication. This seems reasonable. Malware score remains 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar SMTP wrapper, with standard input and credentials.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows into SMTP's sendmail; no suspicious activities.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate email sender, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The low security risk score is justified, considering normal network activity and credential handling. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard SMTP wrapper, supporting OAuth2, with email validation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows into SMTP sendmail; credentials are handled securely.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets; comments about BCC handling are present but do not reflect actual code logic.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior; the code is a typical email sender.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The scores are consistent. The comment about BCC is benign but could be clarified; however, it doesn't impact security.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** SMTP wrapper with OAuth2, email validation, and message prep.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Standard SMTP sendmail; credentials and OAuth tokens are handled properly.\n- **Anomalies:** Comments about BCC handling do not match implementation, but this is benign.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected; the code is a standard email client wrapper.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slightly above 0 (0.2) in most reports, reflecting minimal potential concerns—mainly due to credential handling and network communication, which is reasonable.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**\n\n- Given the absence of any suspicious activity, I would consider lowering the security risk score to **0** across all reports, as no actual vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present.\n- The malware score remains at **0**, which is correct.\n- The obfuscated score remains at **0**.\n\n---\n\n### Final estimate:\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk Score |\n|-----------|--------------|------------|\n| **0**     | **0**        | **0**      |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, well-structured SMTP email sender with OAuth2 support, no malicious intent, and no security risks detected. The current scores are appropriate, but I recommend reducing the security risk score to 0 for maximum accuracy.",
