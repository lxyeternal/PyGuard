  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign SMTP email sender with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The current malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score can be considered very low (~0.1). The scores in the original reports are appropriate; however, the security risk could be conservatively lowered to 0 given the benign nature of the code."
