  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores:\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as a SMTP wrapper with OAuth2 support, email validation, and message handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Appropriately identifies `sendmail` as the sink, with proper flow from input to SMTP.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation. The code is standard and legitimate.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-founded; the code appears benign.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Risk: 0 (appropriate)\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard features, dynamic credential handling, and no malicious signs.\n- Notes that the OAuth2 process is correct and credentials are handled dynamically.\n- No anomalies or malicious activity detected.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2 (slightly above zero, justified by the handling of credentials, but overall low risk)\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Focuses on standard SMTP wrapper features, validation, and no suspicious code.\n- Mentions the 'feedback' function as benign, and no malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2 (consistent with normal credential handling)\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Similar assessment: standard SMTP wrapper, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- Notes the comment about BCC but clarifies no actual implementation, which is benign.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Again, confirms standard features, OAuth2, and no malicious behavior.\n- Comments about BCC are noted but are not implemented, which is benign.\n- No suspicious activity detected.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n\n- **Code validation:** All reports correctly identify the code as a legitimate SMTP wrapper with OAuth2 support.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.2) in most reports, justified by credential handling and external dependencies, but overall low risk.\n\n### My assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — very low, given the nature of the code, but acknowledging potential misconfigurations or misuse (e.g., feedback email), so slightly above zero.\n\n### Final note:\n\nThe reports are consistent, and the code appears benign. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident. The only minor concern is the handling of OAuth2 info (removing 'email_address') and the comment about BCC handling, but these are benign and do not impact security.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the overall assessment that the code is a standard, legitimate SMTP email sender with no malicious intent.",
