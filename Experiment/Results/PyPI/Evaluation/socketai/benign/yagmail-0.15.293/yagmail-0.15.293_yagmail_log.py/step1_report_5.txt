  "purpose": "To create and configure a logger object for yagmail, supporting different logging levels and handlers.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'log_level' and 'file_path_name' which determine logging configuration.",
  "sinks": "Logging output to console or file; no data leaks or untrusted data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Input parameters influence the setup of logger handlers and formatter; no external or untrusted data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. Use of standard logging modules and handlers.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to set up a logger with configurable log level and optional file output. It employs standard logging practices, with appropriate level setting and formatter configuration. The logger setup is straightforward without any obfuscation, hidden code, or external data transmission. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical logging setup function with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It provides configurable logging for debugging and production use.",
