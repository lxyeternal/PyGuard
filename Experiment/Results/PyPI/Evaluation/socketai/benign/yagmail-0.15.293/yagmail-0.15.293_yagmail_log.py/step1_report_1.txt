  "purpose": "To create and configure a logger for yagmail SMTP class logging, allowing different log levels and handlers.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: log_level, file_path_name",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; the code only sets up logging handlers without handling untrusted data",
  "flows": "Input parameters influence logger setup; no untrusted data flows into sinks that could cause harm",
  "anomalies": "None observed; code sets up logging configuration in a standard manner without suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to create and configure a logger with options for console or file output. It correctly sets log levels, formatter, and handlers based on parameters. There are no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors. The logger configuration is straightforward and standard. No dynamic execution or obfuscation is present. No external or untrusted input processing beyond parameter handling, which is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging setup function with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It does not perform any harmful actions, data leakage, or malicious activities.",
