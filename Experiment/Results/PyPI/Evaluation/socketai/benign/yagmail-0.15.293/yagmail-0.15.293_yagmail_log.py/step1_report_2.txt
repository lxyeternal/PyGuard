{
  "purpose": "Provides a function to create and configure a logger for yagmail SMTP class, allowing customizable logging levels and output destinations.",
  "sources": "The get_logger function reads the log_level parameter, optional file_path_name parameter, and internally creates and configures logging handlers and formatters.",
  "sinks": "Logging handlers (FileHandler or StreamHandler) output logs to files or console; no untrusted data sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (log_level, file_path_name) influence logger configuration; the logger is returned with handlers set accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code correctly configures logging with options for file or console output, and null handler when log_level is None.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a get_logger function that initializes a logger, sets its level to ERROR, and adds either a file or stream handler based on input parameters. It provides options for disabling handlers with NullHandler. The logger is configured with a formatter for consistent log message formatting. No untrusted input is processed directly, nor is any malicious or suspicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard logging setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It provides configurable logging for yagmail SMTP operations, with safe handling of log output destinations.",
