{
  "purpose": "Builds MIME email messages supporting HTML, images, attachments, inline images, headers, and optional DKIM signing.",
  "sources": "Reads input files or streams, user data, headers, and attachments; serializes content; constructs MIME parts.",
  "sinks": "Places where untrusted data (files, content) are incorporated into MIME parts; no network or external sinks.",
  "flows": "Input data (files, content) -> serialization and encoding -> MIME parts -> assembled email message.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard email MIME message construction, handling various content types, inline images, attachments, headers, and optional DKIM signing. It validates file paths, encodes content appropriately, and assembles MIME parts securely. No network activity, code obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The use of 'hash' for IDs is benign. The code is clear, well-structured, and employs standard libraries. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented email message builder with no malicious intent or sabotage. It handles untrusted input securely, employs standard practices, and does not contain obfuscation or malicious payloads. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the low risk score reflects minimal concern. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use.",
