{
  "purpose": "This code facilitates OAuth2 authorization flow for Gmail API, enabling email sending with OAuth2 tokens.",
  "sources": "User input via input() and getpass.getpass(), reading OAuth2 JSON files, URL requests to Google OAuth endpoints.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted URL inputs and authorization URLs, JSON file writes, print statements, token retrieval and refresh functions.",
  "flows": "User navigates to URL (source), inputs redirect URL (source), code is extracted and exchanged for tokens (sink), tokens are stored in JSON files.",
  "anomalies": "Use of print statements for URLs and instructions, no obvious hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated patterns. The code does handle sensitive tokens but does not leak them outside storage or network explicitly.",
  "analysis": "The script performs OAuth2 authorization with Google, involving user interaction to retrieve authorization codes, then exchanges codes for tokens, and stores tokens securely in files. It includes standard OAuth2 flow functions with no evident malicious code. No backdoors, data exfiltration, or harmful system commands are present. The only noteworthy aspect is the storage of OAuth tokens locally, which is standard but could be misused if the file is accessed maliciously. Overall, the code implements typical OAuth2 authorization procedures without malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard OAuth2 implementation for Gmail, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It handles OAuth tokens securely and prompts user interaction as expected. No malicious code, backdoors, or harmful actions are evident.",
