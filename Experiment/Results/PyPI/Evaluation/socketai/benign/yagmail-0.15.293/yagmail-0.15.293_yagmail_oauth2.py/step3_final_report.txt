{
  "purpose": "The code implements a standard OAuth2 authorization flow for Gmail, involving user prompts, token exchange, refresh, and local storage of credentials and tokens.",
  "sources": "User input via input() and getpass(), URL redirects, local file I/O for token storage",
  "sinks": "Reading user input, writing tokens to local files, making HTTP requests to Google's OAuth endpoints",
  "flows": "User navigates to permission URL -> user provides redirected URL with code -> code is exchanged for tokens -> tokens are stored and refreshed as needed",
  "anomalies": "Use of input() and print() for user interaction, storing sensitive tokens in local files without encryption, no obfuscation or hidden code",
  "analysis": "The code follows a typical OAuth2 process with user prompts for authorization, token exchange, and refresh. It handles sensitive data by storing tokens locally, which is common but should be secured. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. The code is straightforward and well-structured, with no obfuscation or hidden behaviors. The security considerations are standard for such scripts, with moderate risk due to credential handling but no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate OAuth2 utility for Gmail, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity. The security risk is moderate but acceptable for such scripts. The assessments in the reports are accurate and justified.",
