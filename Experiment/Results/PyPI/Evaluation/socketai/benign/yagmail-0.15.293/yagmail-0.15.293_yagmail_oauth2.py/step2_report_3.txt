  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues present?**  \n  No. The code performs standard OAuth2 flows with user prompts, token exchanges, and storage. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  The report accurately describes the code's behavior. No significant logical flaws or security issues identified.\n\n- **Scores review:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Risk: 0.3 — moderate, considering handling of sensitive tokens and credentials.  \n  These seem reasonable.\n\n- **Justification for risk score > 0.5?**  \n  Not justified; risk is moderate due to credential handling, but no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues present?**  \n  No. Similar to Report 1, standard OAuth2 flows, no malicious code.\n\n- **Errors or flaws?**  \n  No. The analysis aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n- **Scores review:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Risk: 0.2 — low, reflecting typical credential handling.\n\n- **Justification for risk > 0.5?**  \n  No. The risk score seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues present?**  \n  No. The code is a typical OAuth2 implementation for Gmail.\n\n- **Errors or flaws?**  \n  No. The report correctly notes standard behavior.\n\n- **Scores review:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Risk: 0.2 — reasonable.\n\n- **Justification for risk > 0.5?**  \n  No. The risk score is justified as low.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues present?**  \n  No. Standard OAuth2 flow, no malicious activity.\n\n- **Errors or flaws?**  \n  No. The analysis is accurate.\n\n- **Scores review:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Risk: 0.2 — appropriate.\n\n- **Justification for risk > 0.5?**  \n  No.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues present?**  \n  No. Same as others; standard OAuth2 flow, no malicious activity.\n\n- **Errors or flaws?**  \n  No. The report correctly describes the code.\n\n- **Scores review:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Risk: 0.2 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** Ranges from 0.2 to 0.3, reflecting the handling of sensitive credentials and tokens, which is typical for such scripts.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n- No adjustments needed based on the provided analysis.\n- Given the nature of the code—standard OAuth2 flow with user prompts and token storage—there's no indication of supply chain compromise or malicious intent.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — moderate, due to credential handling, but not high.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. The code appears to be a legitimate OAuth2 helper tool without malicious or obfuscated components.",
