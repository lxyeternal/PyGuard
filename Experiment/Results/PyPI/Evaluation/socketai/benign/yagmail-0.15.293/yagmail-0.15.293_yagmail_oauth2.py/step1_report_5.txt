  "purpose": "This script facilitates OAuth2 authentication with Google to generate tokens and OAuth2 strings for email access, specifically for Gmail.",
  "sources": "User inputs for URLs, authorization codes, email addresses, client IDs, and secrets; reading from OAuth2 credential files.",
  "sinks": "Tokens and OAuth2 strings are generated and stored; potential use of these tokens for accessing email accounts.",
  "flows": "User navigates to authorization URL (source), inputs redirect URL with code (source), code is exchanged for tokens (sink), tokens are used to generate OAuth2 strings (sink).",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no hardcoded credentials; however, it prompts for sensitive information and writes OAuth tokens to local files, which could be misused if accessed by malicious actors. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard OAuth2 authorization flow with Google. It retrieves and stores tokens securely and generates OAuth2 strings for authentication. The process involves user interaction for authorization and saving tokens locally. No code injection, data leakage, or backdoors are present. The functions are straightforward and conform to typical OAuth2 procedures. No malicious behavior detected; it does handle sensitive data but does not exfiltrate it or perform harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The script implements legitimate OAuth2 authentication for Gmail with no evidence of malicious intent or malware. It handles sensitive credentials carefully, prompting for secrets and storing tokens securely. There are no suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious payloads present.",
