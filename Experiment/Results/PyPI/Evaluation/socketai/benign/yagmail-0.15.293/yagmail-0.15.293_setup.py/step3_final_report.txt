  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for packaging a Python project using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' file, static version variables, package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, entry points.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, no network activity, no dynamic code execution, no handling of external input.",
  "flows": "Reading README -> defining static variables -> calling setup() with static data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets beyond author info, no obfuscation, no malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script utilizing setuptools for packaging. It reads a local README file, defines static version components, and calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and entry points. There are no dynamic operations, external data handling, network activity, or obfuscated code. All signals point to a benign, standard package configuration script. The static nature and lack of suspicious patterns confirm no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard Python package setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all correctly set to 0, reflecting its benign nature. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's content.",
