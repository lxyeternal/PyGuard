{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'yagmail' Python package, intended to configure package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' file for long description; static string definitions for version; package metadata fields.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; no user input, network, or file output based on this script.",
  "flows": "Reading file 'README.rst' and assigning static values to variables, no flow involving untrusted input or data manipulation beyond initial read.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; use of standard setup tools and static versioning; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script employing setuptools for packaging. It reads a README file for description, defines version info statically, and configures package metadata and dependencies. No dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no input handling that could indicate malicious intent. All used functions and variables are typical for package setup. No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
