{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing the 'yagmail' Python module.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' for long description; importing setup and find_packages from setuptools; defining version variables; defining setup() parameters including name, version, description, URL, author info, dependencies, classifiers, packages, and entry points.",
  "sinks": "The code does not invoke any untrusted input sources, network calls, or execute untrusted code. The setup() parameters are static or derived from local files.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; setup parameters are statically defined or read from a file, without processing untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are observed. The code strictly performs standard setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools, reads a README file for the description, constructs version string from predefined variables, and calls setup() with fixed parameters. All variables are static or local, with no external input or dynamic code execution. The purpose is solely to prepare the package for distribution. No obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious code elements are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward setup script for packaging a Python module. There are no indicators of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate and safe configuration file.",
