  "purpose": "Configure the setup and distribution parameters for the 'yagmail' Python package.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.rst' file for long description; static assignment of version components; package metadata definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no external data is written or transmitted based on this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; setup configuration is static and based on local files and hardcoded values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools, reads a README file for description, defines version info, and calls setup() with package metadata. All data is static or read from a local file. No external inputs, no dynamic code execution, no network operations, or security-sensitive operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration script for packaging a Python module. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious anomalies, and no security risks. The package appears legitimate and safe.",
