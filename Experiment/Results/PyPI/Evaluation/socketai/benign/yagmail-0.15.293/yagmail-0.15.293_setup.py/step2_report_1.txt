  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their assessments with the code and considering the scoring rationale.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It is a standard `setup.py` script using `setuptools`.\n- Reads a README file for description.\n- Defines version info via static variables.\n- Calls `setup()` with typical package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and entry points.\n- No dynamic code, network activity, or untrusted input handling.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Standard setup configuration.\n- Findings: No untrusted sources, no suspicious code, no anomalies.\n- Conclusion: Legitimate, no malicious behavior.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Fully aligns with the code. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Package configuration.\n- Findings: Static data, no external data, no anomalies.\n- Conclusion: Standard setup script, safe.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Also consistent; no concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Setup for packaging.\n- Findings: Reads README, static version, no untrusted data, no anomalies.\n- Conclusion: Benign, standard script.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Packaging configuration.\n- Findings: Reads README, static variables, no untrusted data, no anomalies.\n- Conclusion: Straightforward setup script.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct; no concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Packaging setup.\n- Findings: Typical static configuration, no suspicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: No signs of malicious activity.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- **Code presence:** The code is a typical `setup.py` with no malicious or suspicious logic.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly 0; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- All reports are consistent with the code's content.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores are reasonable and justified.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, safe package setup script with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is legitimate, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned are appropriate.",
