  "purpose": "Define compatibility for text string types depending on Python version.",
  "sources": "Reads from system modules 'os' and 'sys', and checks Python version information.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; code only reads system info and sets variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard compatibility code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules 'os' and 'sys' without any suspicious activity. It determines if the Python version is 3.x and defines 'text_type' accordingly, using 'str' for Python 3 and 'str' with 'unicode' for Python 2. This pattern is common for maintaining compatibility across Python versions. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious constructs. No obfuscated code or malicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical compatibility snippet used in many Python projects to handle differences between Python 2 and 3. It poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
