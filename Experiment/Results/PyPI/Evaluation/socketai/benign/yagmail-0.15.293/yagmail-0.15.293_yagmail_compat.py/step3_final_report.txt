  "purpose": "Python 2/3 compatibility check and type assignment based on Python version.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info[0] for Python version; no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data output or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only performs version check and variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward compatibility pattern, no obfuscation, no secrets, no malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, checks Python version, and defines 'text_type' accordingly. It is a common pattern for ensuring compatibility across Python versions. No suspicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious operations are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with high confidence. The code does not perform any harmful actions or obfuscation, and the scores are consistent with its function.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard compatibility snippet with no security risks or malicious intent. All reports are accurate, and the scores should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk.",
