  "purpose": "Define compatibility for string types based on Python version",
  "sources": "Reading the sys.version_info attribute",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; setting a variable for later use",
  "flows": "sys.version_info → PY3 variable, which influences text_type",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version check and variable assignment",
  "analysis": "The code imports os and sys modules, checks Python version to define text_type accordingly. It sets PY3 as a boolean indicating Python 3.x. Based on PY3, text_type is assigned to be either str or a tuple containing str and unicode, for compatibility. The code appears to be a standard compatibility shim, with no suspicious or malicious behavior. No data leaks, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic execution or obfuscated code. The code's purpose is to ensure cross-version compatibility for string types.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple compatibility check for string types between Python 2 and 3. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The code is benign.",
