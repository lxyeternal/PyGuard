  "purpose": "Define compatibility for string types based on Python version",
  "sources": "Import statements (os, sys), reading sys.version_info",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data is being sent or written to external sources",
  "flows": "No data flow from input to output or sink identified",
  "anomalies": "Use of unicode in Python 2 compatibility code is common, no malicious anomalies observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and sets up version-dependent string types for compatibility between Python 2 and 3. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or unsafe operations. The code appears to be a common compatibility snippet, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python compatibility setup with no malicious behavior detected. It simply determines the Python version and sets a string type alias accordingly.",
