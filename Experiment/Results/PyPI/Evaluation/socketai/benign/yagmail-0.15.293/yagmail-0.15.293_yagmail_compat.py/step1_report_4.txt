  "purpose": "Define compatibility variables for Python 2 and 3 by checking Python version and setting text_type accordingly.",
  "sources": "Reading sys.version_info to determine Python version.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or output occurs.",
  "flows": "sys.version_info is checked to set text_type; no data flows beyond variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated patterns, or hardcoded secrets; simple compatibility setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries os and sys but only utilizes sys to determine Python version and define a type alias for string types. There are no input sources, no data processing, and no data sinks that could cause leaks or vulnerabilities. The code appears to be a common pattern for compatibility purposes, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a straightforward compatibility check for Python 2 and 3 without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It is safe and does not pose security risks.",
