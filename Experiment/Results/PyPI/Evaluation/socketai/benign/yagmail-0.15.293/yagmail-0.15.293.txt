      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is a standard build and deployment script with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the unsafe execution of shell commands via os.system, which could be exploited if environment or inputs are manipulated. The malware score is 0, and obfuscated is 0, consistent with the straightforward nature of the code. The security risk score should be moderate, around 0.3, acknowledging the potential for command injection if inputs are compromised, but currently no active malicious activity is evident."

This does not constitute a security risk or malicious activity. All reports correctly identify the benign nature; the only adjustment needed is recognizing that the security risk score should be zero, not slightly elevated, as no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present."

The current malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score can be considered very low (~0.1). The scores in the original reports are appropriate; however, the security risk could be conservatively lowered to 0 given the benign nature of the code."

It handles untrusted input securely, employs standard practices, and does not contain obfuscation or malicious payloads. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the low risk score reflects minimal concern. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use."
