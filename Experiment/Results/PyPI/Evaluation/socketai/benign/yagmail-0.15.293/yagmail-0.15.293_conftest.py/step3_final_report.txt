  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks, focusing on code patterns, obfuscation, and suspicious activities.",
  "sources": "eval(), exec(), hardcoded strings, environment variables, network calls, dynamic imports, input functions.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission, file system access, environment variable access, system commands, eval/exec execution points.",
  "flows": "Input sources (user input, environment variables, hardcoded secrets) to sinks via eval(), exec(), network calls, or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval() with unvalidated input, hardcoded credentials, obfuscated variable names, cryptic control flow, dynamic imports, empty or no code.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits patterns such as eval() with unvalidated input, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, and dynamic imports, which are common indicators of malicious intent or obfuscation. Empty or absent code in some reports indicates no activity. Suspicious patterns are present but lack definitive proof of malicious activity. The scores assigned (malware ~0.4, obfuscation ~0.4-0.7, risk ~0.5) are consistent with the suspicion level, reflecting moderate concern without confirmed malicious actions. The analysis suggests that further dynamic or runtime analysis would be necessary for definitive conclusions.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and potential malicious patterns but lacks concrete evidence of malicious activity. The overall security risk is moderate, warranting caution and further analysis. The scores are justified and consistent with the observed patterns.",
