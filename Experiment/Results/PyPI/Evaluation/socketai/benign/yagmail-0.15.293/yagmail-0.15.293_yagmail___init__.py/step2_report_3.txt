  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements and metadata definitions.\n- No untrusted data sources, sinks, or data flows are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n- The code is standard for setting up a package or module that uses yagmail for email functionalities.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code snippets are benign, with no evidence of malicious intent, supply chain compromise, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The reports correctly identify the lack of data processing, input handling, or network operations.\n- The scores assigned—malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0—are appropriate given the content.\n\n**Score justification:**\n- Since there's no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risk, the scores should remain at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and securityRisk.\n- The confidence level of 1 is justified due to the straightforward nature of the code.\n- The reports' conclusions are consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Potential issues or points of critique:**\n- The reports are very conservative and do not consider the possibility that imported modules could be malicious if compromised upstream. However, given only this snippet, there's no evidence of that.\n- No changes needed in scores or reasoning.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThis code is a benign setup with standard imports and metadata. No malicious or security concerns are evident based on this snippet. The reports' evaluations are accurate and consistent with the code content.",
