{
  "purpose": "Define package metadata and import specific modules and classes from the yagmail package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from yagmail.error, yagmail.password, yagmail.sender, and yagmail.utils modules.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling, data leakage, or external communication is evident.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code only imports modules and does not process input or perform operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual patterns; standard import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code declares package metadata and imports specific components from the yagmail library. There are no functions, data processing, or external communication. All imports appear to be standard for email handling, error management, and utility functions. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or anomalies are present. The code is typical for a Python package initialization or setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely imports modules from the yagmail library and defines basic package metadata. It contains no malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks. It is a standard import block with no malicious intent.",
