  "purpose": "Package setup and import of yagmail modules for email functionalities.",
  "sources": "Metadata definitions (__project__, __version__) and import statements from yagmail modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data flow from input to output.",
  "flows": "None; code only imports modules and sets metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of package metadata and import statements from the yagmail library. There are no data processing, user input handling, network activity, or executable logic. The imports are from legitimate modules related to email handling, error management, registration, logging, and utilities. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code. The code is a standard setup snippet for a Python email package, posing no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports correctly identify its harmless nature and assign appropriate scores. No modifications are necessary.",
