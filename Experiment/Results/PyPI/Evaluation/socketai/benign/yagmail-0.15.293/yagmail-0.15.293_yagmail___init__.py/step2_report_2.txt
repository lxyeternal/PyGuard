  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simply defining package metadata (__project__, __version__) and importing modules from yagmail.\n- No data processing, user input, network activity, or external communication is present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature described.\n\n**Step-by-step review:**\n\n1. **Code correctness and presence of issues:**\n   - The code matches the original snippet exactly.\n   - No evidence of malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic.\n   - The imports are from legitimate modules, and the code is purely setup/metadata.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in reasoning:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; no logical flaws are evident.\n   - They correctly interpret the code as benign, with no malicious activity or security issues.\n\n3. **Scores assigned:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - malware = 0\n     - securityRisk = 0\n     - obfuscated = 0\n     - confidence = 1\n   - These seem appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n4. **Justification for higher risk scores:**\n   - Since the code is only importing modules and defining metadata, there is no justification for higher risk scores.\n   - The malware score is correctly set to 0; no malicious behavior is indicated.\n   - The security risk score is also correctly 0.\n\n5. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the code as benign.\n   - They correctly identify that no untrusted data handling or network activity is present.\n\n6. **Consistency of scores with the report:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n- Given the nature of the code, even if a supply chain attack were to occur, this snippet alone does not introduce risk.\n- The overall package could be compromised elsewhere, but based solely on this code, the risk is minimal.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and appropriately score the code as benign. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis: the code is straightforward, harmless, and standard for package setup.",
