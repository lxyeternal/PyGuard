  "conclusion": "The code is a standard build and deployment script with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the unsafe execution of shell commands via os.system, which could be exploited if environment or inputs are manipulated. The malware score is 0, and obfuscated is 0, consistent with the straightforward nature of the code. The security risk score should be moderate, around 0.3, acknowledging the potential for command injection if inputs are compromised, but currently no active malicious activity is evident."
