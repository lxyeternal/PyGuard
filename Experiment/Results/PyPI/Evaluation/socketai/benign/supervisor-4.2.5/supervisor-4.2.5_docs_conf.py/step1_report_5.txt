  "purpose": "Configuration script for building project documentation with Sphinx, setting up paths, extensions, and output options.",
  "sources": "Reading 'supervisor/version.txt' for version info, importing sys and os modules, and accessing static/image files.",
  "sinks": "Opening 'version.txt' file, potentially exposing version info if accessed externally, and referencing static image files.",
  "flows": "Reading version info from file and appending static/static paths for documentation assets.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or malicious constructs; static paths and file reads are typical for documentation configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up Sphinx documentation parameters, including path manipulations, version file reading, and static assets. No code executes external commands, uses untrusted input, or performs network operations. The file read for version info is straightforward and not malicious. Static paths and files are common for documentation. There are no signs of obfuscation or hidden malicious intent. Overall, the script is standard configuration code with no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration file for Sphinx documentation setup. It performs predictable operations such as path adjustments, reading a version file, and setting static asset locations. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks.",
