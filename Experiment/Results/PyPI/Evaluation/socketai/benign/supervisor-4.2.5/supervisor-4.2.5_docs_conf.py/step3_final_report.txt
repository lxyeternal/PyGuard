  "purpose": "Configuration setup for Sphinx documentation builder, including paths, extensions, and project info.",
  "sources": "Reads version.txt from local filesystem, appends static paths, imports sys and os modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; reads local files, sets static configuration variables.",
  "flows": "Reads version.txt to assign version variables; no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code; minor lack of exception handling when reading version.txt, but benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Sphinx configuration script. It reads a local version file without validation, appends static paths, and sets configuration options for documentation generation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or network activity. The absence of error handling for file reading is a minor robustness concern but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard configuration script with no malicious or suspicious activity. It poses minimal security risk, and the scores should reflect its safe nature.",
