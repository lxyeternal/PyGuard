  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically, focusing on potential security implications, code behavior, and scoring consistency.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as defining internal constants and lookup functions for process, supervisor, and event listener states.\n- No external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The code is static, straightforward, and intended solely for internal state management.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic are evident.\n- The only minor point is a \"securityRisk\" score of 0.1 in report 4, which seems to be an overestimation given the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming Issues in the Code:\n- The code functions as intended: defining constants, creating reverse mappings, and providing description functions.\n- No issues or vulnerabilities are present in the code logic or structure.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are apparent.\n- The code is clean, well-structured, and safe.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is correct.\n- The \"securityRisk\" score in report 4 is 0.1, which appears unjustified given the benign static mappings. I would recommend lowering this to 0.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0 across all reports, which is accurate.\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk score higher than 0.5, which is appropriate.\n- The highest is 0.1, which is reasonable considering the code's simplicity.\n\n### Malware Score:\n- Consistently 0, which aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n### Claims Based on Assumptions:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as non-malicious, with no suspicious behavior or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Consistency of Scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature: simple internal mappings with no external dependencies or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Estimated malware score:** 0  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Estimated security risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a straightforward internal utility for state enumeration and description. No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior is present.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign, with no security risks.\n- The minor securityRisk score of 0.1 in report 4 should be reduced to 0.\n- All other scores are appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate in their assessment; the code is safe and non-malicious.",
