  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code and the reasoning, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Defines classes with integer constants representing various states (ProcessStates, SupervisorStates, EventListenerStates).\n- Provides functions to retrieve descriptions based on these codes.\n- Uses an internal helper function `_names_by_code` to generate reverse mappings from code to attribute name.\n- All operations are internal, static, and do not involve external data, network, or dynamic code execution.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correctly identifies the code as internal constants and mappings.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Finds no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0, consistent.\n- **Security risk:** 0, appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate, no issues.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 2:\n- **Purpose & sources:** Same as above, no external input.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct, straightforward utility code.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 3:\n- Similar to previous, clear internal mappings, no external data or suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid, no concerns.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 4:\n- Slightly higher security risk score (0.1), but the reasoning states that the code only retrieves descriptions based on internal mappings, with no untrusted data handling.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (perhaps slightly overestimating, but still minimal).\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the small security risk score might be a conservative default, but the code itself is benign.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 5:\n- Similar reasoning, no external input, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Checking scores and logic:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as internal, static, and safe.\n- The malware scores are consistently 0, which is appropriate.\n- The security risk scores are mostly 0, with one report at 0.1, which is acceptable given the code's nature.\n- No report claims any actual malicious activity or vulnerability.\n\n### Final evaluation:\n- The code is a straightforward internal utility for managing and describing process states.\n- No external dependencies, no obfuscated code, no dynamic behaviors.\n- The functions are simple lookups, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Security risk score:** 0 (no external data, no vulnerabilities)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code is benign. The slight variation in security risk scores (some at 0, one at 0.1) can be justified as conservative, but overall, the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** All evidence points to this being a standard internal enumeration module with no security concerns.",
