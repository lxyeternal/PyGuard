{
  "purpose": "Defines process, supervisor, and event listener states with associated descriptions and internal mappings.",
  "sources": "Constants defining state codes, functions returning descriptions based on internal mappings, and internal helper function for mapping codes to names.",
  "sinks": "The getProcessStateDescription, getSupervisorStateDescription, and getEventListenerStateDescription functions access internal dictionaries to retrieve descriptions, but do not process untrusted input directly.",
  "flows": "Function calls to retrieve descriptions from internal dictionaries based on provided codes; no external data input or output involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward, with clear purpose, no obfuscated logic, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines static constants for process, supervisor, and event listener states, along with functions to get their descriptions via internal mappings. These mappings are generated from class attributes, which are not influenced by external data. No external input handling, network activity, or risky operations are present. The code appears to serve as an internal enumeration utility without malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple enumeration mapping utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs internal lookups and does not process untrusted data or perform any dangerous operations.",
