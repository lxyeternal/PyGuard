  "purpose": "Define and manage various process, supervisor, and event listener states with descriptive mappings.",
  "sources": "Constants defined within classes, and the _names_by_code function which reflects class attributes.",
  "sinks": "The getProcessStateDescription, getSupervisorStateDescription, getEventListenerStateDescription functions which access internal dictionaries for code descriptions.",
  "flows": "Code attributes are used to build dictionaries; external calls to get description functions retrieve descriptions based on codes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious data leaks, no obfuscated code, and no dynamic code execution observed. The only notable aspect is the indirect reflection of class attributes into dictionaries, which is safe and intended for internal lookups.",
  "analysis": "The code defines process, supervisor, and event listener state classes with integer constants. It then creates mappings from these constants to their attribute names via the _names_by_code function, used internally by description functions. These functions simply retrieve descriptive strings from pre-built dictionaries. There is no use of external input, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no suspicious logic. The code appears straightforward and solely intended for internal state management.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, well-structured internal module for state management. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe for use and serves as a utility for state descriptions.",
