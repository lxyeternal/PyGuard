  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Internal enumeration and description functions.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Internal, no external data or network activity.\n- Anomalies: None, straightforward code.\n- Analysis: No malicious behavior, static constants, internal mappings.\n- Conclusion: Safe, no security risks.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar internal enumeration definitions.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Internal, no external data.\n- Anomalies: No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n- Analysis: Purely static, safe utility functions.\n- Conclusion: No malicious activity.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Internal state descriptions.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Internal mappings, no external data.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious behavior.\n- Analysis: Straightforward internal constants and lookups.\n- Conclusion: Safe, benign utility.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: State definitions and mappings.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Internal, no external input.\n- Anomalies: No malicious patterns.\n- Analysis: Static internal utility.\n- Conclusion: No security risks.\n- Risk score: 0.1 — slightly above zero, but given the code's static nature, this is likely an overestimation. No actual security concern.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Enumeration and description functions.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Internal, no external data.\n- Anomalies: No obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n- Analysis: Simple internal mappings.\n- Conclusion: Safe, no security risks.\n- Scores: all zero.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is static, internal, and non-malicious.\n- **Malware risk:** No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior. All reports agree on this, with scores of 0.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; all are straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly elevated in report 4 (0.1), but this appears unjustified given the code's simplicity.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** Given the static, internal-only nature, a risk score of 0 is appropriate. The 0.1 in report 4 should be adjusted to 0 for consistency.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n- The code is a benign internal utility for state management.\n- No malicious or security-threatening behavior is present.\n- The scores should be: **malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0** for all reports.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the reports' conclusions that this code is safe and non-malicious.**",
