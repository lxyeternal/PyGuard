  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code defines classes with constants representing various states.\n- It creates internal dictionaries mapping codes to attribute names.\n- It provides functions to retrieve descriptions based on codes.\n- No external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The code appears purely static and intended for internal use.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed review of each report:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; internal constants and mappings.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; no malicious activity, straightforward internal utility.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0, Risk=0.5.\n\n**Verdict:** The assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; no external data.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; static mappings, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0, Risk=0.5.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; internal constants and mappings.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0, Risk=0.5.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; internal constants, no external input.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; static, safe code.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0.1, Risk=0.5.\n\n**Note:** Slightly elevated security risk score (0.1) is acceptable, as it reflects minimal concern, but no actual security issue exists.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; internal mappings.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0, Risk=0.5.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Given the nature of the code (internal constants and mappings), a risk score of 0.5 is reasonable, indicating low but non-zero potential concern if the code were to be misused, which isn't evident here.\n\n**Additional comments:**\n\n- The code is a simple internal enumeration utility.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or external dependencies.\n- The security risk score could be slightly higher (e.g., 0.1) in report 4, which is justified by the minimal concern, but overall, 0.5 is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n- The reported scores are consistent with the code analysis.\n- No changes are necessary; all scores are justified.\n- The overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain as they are, with perhaps a slight note that risk scores could be marginally increased in some contexts, but given the static, internal nature, the current scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n**Maintain current scores.** The code is benign, well-structured, and safe for use in internal systems.",
