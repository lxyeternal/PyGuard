{
  "purpose": "Define and provide descriptions for various process, supervisor, and event listener states used internally within a system.",
  "sources": "Constants defining states, functions accessing internal mappings, and internal helper function for code-to-name mapping.",
  "sinks": "The code retrieves descriptions from internal dictionaries based on codes, but does not process untrusted input directly.",
  "flows": "Code reads input via function arguments (codes), looks up internal dictionaries, and returns descriptions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no backdoors, no unusual behavior. The internal mapping function is used for efficiency but is safe. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious behavior evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines state constants for process, supervisor, and event listener states. It creates dictionaries mapping codes to names via an internal helper function. Functions provide description lookups based on provided codes. No external inputs or untrusted data handling is evident. The code appears purely static and for internal use, with no signs of malicious activity, data leaks, or obfuscation. The structure is straightforward, and no suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as an internal state management utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs static lookups of internal state codes to descriptive strings and does not process untrusted data. Overall, the code appears safe and benign.",
