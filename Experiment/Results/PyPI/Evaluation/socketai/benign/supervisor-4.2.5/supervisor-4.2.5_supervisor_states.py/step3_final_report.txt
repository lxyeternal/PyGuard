  "purpose": "Defines internal enumerations for process, supervisor, and event listener states, along with functions to retrieve their descriptions.",
  "sources": "Internal class attributes and the _names_by_code helper function generating reverse mappings.",
  "sinks": "None; no external input or data flow involved.",
  "flows": "Functions retrieve descriptions via internal dictionaries; no external data flow or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static mappings and functions, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static class constants representing various states, with internal dictionaries mapping codes to attribute names. Functions like getProcessStateDescription use these mappings to return descriptions. The code is purely internal, with no external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. It is well-structured, clear, and serves as an internal utility for state management. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The security risk score assigned in some reports (e.g., 0.1) is an overestimation; given the static and internal nature, it should be 0.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign internal utility for managing process-related states. All reports correctly identify its static, internal nature and assign appropriate malware and obfuscation scores. The slight elevation in security risk score (0.1) in one report is unjustified and should be adjusted to 0. The overall assessment is that there is no malicious behavior or security concern present.",
