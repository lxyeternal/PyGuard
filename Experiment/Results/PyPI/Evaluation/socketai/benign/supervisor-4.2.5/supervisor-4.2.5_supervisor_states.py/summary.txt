  "conclusion": "The code is a benign internal utility for managing process-related states. All reports correctly identify its static, internal nature and assign appropriate malware and obfuscation scores. The slight elevation in security risk score (0.1) in one report is unjustified and should be adjusted to 0. The overall assessment is that there is no malicious behavior or security concern present."
