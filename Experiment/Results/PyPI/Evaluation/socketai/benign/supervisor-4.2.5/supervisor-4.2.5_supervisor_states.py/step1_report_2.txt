{
  "purpose": "Define various process, supervisor, and event listener states along with functions to retrieve descriptions based on codes.",
  "sources": "None; the code defines constants, functions, and internal mappings without external data input or user input handling.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or output data to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the functions simply return descriptions based on internal mappings.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains straightforward mappings and constants with no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or hidden behavior. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code structures observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines class constants representing different states and uses a helper function to create dictionaries mapping codes to names. These mappings are used for lookups via dedicated functions. No external input handling, network operations, or data leaks are present. The structure is simple and clear, with no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be purely for defining and retrieving state descriptions, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as a static mapping utility without external dependencies or hidden actions.",
