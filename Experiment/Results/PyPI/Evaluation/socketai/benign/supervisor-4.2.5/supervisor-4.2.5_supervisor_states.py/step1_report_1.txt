{
  "purpose": "Define various enumerations and description retrieval functions for process, supervisor, and event listener states, with internal mappings for state codes to names.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the class attributes (e.g., ProcessStates, SupervisorStates, EventListenerStates) and the internal dictionaries (_names_by_code and its derived mappings). No external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "The functions retrieve descriptions from internal dictionaries; no data sinks, network communication, or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "The code maps class attribute values to names and provides functions to retrieve descriptions based on codes; data flow is internal mapping without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. It includes only standard class definitions and internal mappings.",
  "analysis": "The script defines state classes with integer constants for process, supervisor, and event listener states, and provides functions to retrieve their descriptions using internally generated dictionaries. These dictionaries are created using a utility function that maps numeric codes back to attribute names, enabling reverse lookups. No external inputs, network activity, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code appears to serve as internal constants and lookups, with no malicious or security-threatening behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, non-malicious set of internal state definitions and lookup functions. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It functions as intended for internal state management.",
