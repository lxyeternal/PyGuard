  "conclusion": "The code is a standard supervisor RPC interface with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or sabotage. It provides process control and monitoring capabilities expected in such systems. The low security risk score reflects potential misuse if exposed externally, but this is a deployment concern rather than an inherent flaw. Overall, the supply chain security posture appears sound."
