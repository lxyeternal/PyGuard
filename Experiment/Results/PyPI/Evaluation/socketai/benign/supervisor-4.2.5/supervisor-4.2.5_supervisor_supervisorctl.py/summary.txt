  "conclusion": "The script is a standard supervisorctl CLI tool with no malicious intent or code. The main security consideration is the network interaction points, especially log tailing over HTTP and dynamic URL reconfiguration, which could be exploited if inputs are malicious. The code itself does not contain malware or obfuscation. The risk is moderate but acceptable in a controlled environment."
