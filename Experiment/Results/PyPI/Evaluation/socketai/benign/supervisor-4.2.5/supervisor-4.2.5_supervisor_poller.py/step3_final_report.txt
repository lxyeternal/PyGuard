{
  "purpose": "Provides an abstraction over system-specific polling mechanisms (select, poll, kqueue) for managing file descriptors and event-driven I/O.",
  "sources": "Reads input/output readiness states from system calls and file descriptor registration functions.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or data leaks; interactions are limited to system calls and internal data structures.",
  "flows": "From registration/unregistration of file descriptors to polling system calls and handling their events.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected; error handling is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code implements platform-specific polling classes with proper error handling and resource management. No malicious behaviors, data leaks, or obfuscation are present. Error handling for system calls is appropriate, and logging is benign. The code is a typical, well-structured implementation of I/O multiplexing mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of platform-dependent polling mechanisms with no signs of malicious or suspicious activity. It maintains proper error handling and resource management, with no obfuscation or malicious intent detected.",
