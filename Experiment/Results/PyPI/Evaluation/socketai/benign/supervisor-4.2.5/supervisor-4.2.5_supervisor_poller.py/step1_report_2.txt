{
  "purpose": "Defines various classes for polling mechanisms (select, poll, kqueue) to handle file descriptor events in an event-driven system.",
  "sources": "Input data/read from file descriptors (fd) during registration and polling operations.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data; code primarily manages file descriptors and system calls.",
  "flows": "File descriptors are registered/modified and then polled for events, with control flow depending on system call outcomes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. No unusual dynamic code execution or obfuscated code. Logging messages are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code implements platform-dependent polling mechanisms without external data sources or sinks that could be exploited. Exception handling is standard, addressing EINTR and EBADF errors. No user input handling, network operations, or data leaks are present. The methods focus on managing file descriptors with proper registration and cleanup. No signs of malicious intent or covert behavior are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides a well-structured, platform-adaptive polling interface without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It performs system-level operations securely and transparently, aligning with typical event-driven server architectures.",
