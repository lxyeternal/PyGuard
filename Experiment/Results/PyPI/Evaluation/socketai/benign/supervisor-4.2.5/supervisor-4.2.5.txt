      "conclusion": "The code is a standard supervisor RPC interface with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or sabotage. It provides process control and monitoring capabilities expected in such systems. The low security risk score reflects potential misuse if exposed externally, but this is a deployment concern rather than an inherent flaw. Overall, the supply chain security posture appears sound."

The low risk score is justified given the use of environment variables and unvalidated input handling, which are common in such contexts but do not indicate malicious intent."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign internal utility for managing process-related states. All reports correctly identify its static, internal nature and assign appropriate malware and obfuscation scores. The slight elevation in security risk score (0.1) in one report is unjustified and should be adjusted to 0. The overall assessment is that there is no malicious behavior or security concern present."

The main security consideration is the network interaction points, especially log tailing over HTTP and dynamic URL reconfiguration, which could be exploited if inputs are malicious. The code itself does not contain malware or obfuscation. The risk is moderate but acceptable in a controlled environment."

The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score of 0.2 is appropriate considering potential data leakage via stdout. No modifications are necessary."
