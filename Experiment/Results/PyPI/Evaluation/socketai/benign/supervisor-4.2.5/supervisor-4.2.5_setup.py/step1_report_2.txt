{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the supervisor package, configuring dependencies, metadata, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading version information from 'version.txt', reading README and CHANGES files, importing modules os, sys, setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data is processed or executed unsafely.",
  "flows": "Reading version and documentation files during setup; defining package metadata and entry points; no external data flow or user input handling.",
  "anomalies": "Standard setup routine; no anomalies observed. Exception handling for missing README or CHANGES files is benign; fallback default description used.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical package setup procedures: importing modules, checking Python version compatibility, reading metadata files, defining package requirements, and configuring setuptools. It properly handles missing files with try-except blocks, assigns defaults, and does not include any suspicious code, dynamic execution, or embedded secrets. All operations are standard and necessary for packaging; no malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate setup configuration for the supervisor Python package with no indications of malicious activity. It safely manages file reading, dependency declaration, and package metadata. No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
