  "purpose": "Utility functions for static analysis of Python's AST, including comment extraction, type checking detection, marking text ranges, locating docstring lines, converting call args to kwargs, attribute name extraction, context manager collection, and constants extraction.",
  "sources": "Source code strings, AST nodes, and source code for tokenization and analysis.",
  "sinks": "None; purely internal data processing with no external data transmission or malicious sinks.",
  "flows": "Reads source code and AST nodes; no external data flow or command execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of static analysis utilities using standard libraries and third-party tools in a benign manner. It does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or code execution. The use of 'asttokens' and 'ast.literal_eval' is standard and safe. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is present. The scores assigned in the original reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate static analysis utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The original scores are appropriate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
