  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1:\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for AST analysis, source code comments, docstrings, constants, etc.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data sinks; purely static analysis.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a standard static analysis utility with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Fully consistent. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2:\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar static analysis functions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data transmission or malicious behavior.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, relies on standard libraries.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Safe, benign utility code.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent, no concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3:\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for code analysis.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No network or external data activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Benign static analysis helper functions.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.1 (slightly above zero, possibly due to source code parsing but not malicious)\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly elevated security risk score (0.1) seems reasonable given the code's nature. No malware indicated.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4:\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar static analysis functions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external communication or malicious behavior.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate static analysis utility.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5:\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Helper functions for static analysis.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or system modification.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Benign utility code.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.1 (again, a small risk score due to source code processing)\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly elevated but reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity, with scores at 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports mark as 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports, justified by the fact that the code processes source code and ASTs, which could be misused if embedded malicious code, but no evidence of such exists.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a standard utility for static analysis, with no network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads.\n- The use of `ast.literal_eval` is safe in this context.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The small risk scores (0.1) are reasonable given the code's potential to be misused if embedded malicious code, but as provided, it appears safe.\n\n### **My Overall Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (consistent with the reports, reflecting minimal inherent risk in source code analysis tools)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. The code is benign and suitable for static analysis purposes.",
