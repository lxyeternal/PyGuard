{
  "purpose": "Provides helper functions for analyzing Python AST nodes, including extracting comments, marking text ranges, checking for type checking, and retrieving constants and attribute names.",
  "sources": "Reads source code input (parameter 'source') in 'get_toplevel_comments' and 'mark_text_ranges'; inspects AST nodes in functions like 'get_docstring_lineno', 'kwargs_from_node', 'get_attribute_name', 'get_contextmanagers', 'get_constants'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks where untrusted data affects system behavior or leaks; functions mainly process AST nodes and source code for analysis purposes.",
  "flows": "Source input (source code string) flows into 'get_toplevel_comments' and 'mark_text_ranges'; source code is parsed into AST, then analyzed for docstrings, comments, constants, and attribute names, with no data leaving or affecting external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code relies solely on standard libraries and well-known third-party packages. No network operations, system modifications, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of helper functions for static analysis of Python source code using the AST module. It includes safe and standard operations such as extracting comments, marking node text ranges, identifying type checking conditions, and retrieving constants and attribute names. The imported third-party libraries are used for AST token handling and string manipulation but do not introduce malicious behavior. There are no signs of malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or system compromise mechanisms. All functions operate on data within their scope and do not perform external communications or modifications. The code appears to be a legitimate utility module intended for static code analysis or AST manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for static AST analysis with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It utilizes standard and third-party libraries safely, with no suspicious behaviors or backdoors detected.",
