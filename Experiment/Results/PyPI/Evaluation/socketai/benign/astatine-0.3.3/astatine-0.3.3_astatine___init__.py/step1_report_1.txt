{
  "purpose": "Provides helper functions for analyzing Python AST nodes, including extracting comments, marking text ranges, identifying type checking blocks, extracting docstring line numbers, converting function call arguments to kwargs, extracting attribute names, gathering context managers, and collecting constants from a module.",
  "sources": "Reads source code string input, AST nodes, and source code to generate data about comments, docstrings, AST node attributes, and constants.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that could lead to data leaks, command execution, or malicious actions. No untrusted data flow to sensitive or dangerous operations.",
  "flows": "Source: source string, AST nodes -> various functions extract data -> no data is sent externally or used maliciously.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. Uses standard AST processing and third-party libraries in typical manner. No suspicious network activity or malicious intent apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of utility functions for working with Python ASTs and source code analysis. It includes functions for extracting comments, checking for type checking conditions, marking code ranges, locating docstring line numbers, converting call arguments, retrieving attribute names, extracting context managers, and constants. The implementation relies on standard library modules, well-maintained third-party libraries, and proper version checks. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious data handling are present. The code appears to be legitimate tooling for static analysis and AST manipulation without any malicious or security-compromising operations.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of utility functions for AST and source code analysis with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoor functions. It appears to be safe and intended for legitimate static code analysis or tooling purposes.",
