  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Utility functions for AST analysis.\n- Sources: Source code strings and AST nodes.\n- Sinks: None identified that could lead to malicious effects.\n- Flows: Data flows are confined to static analysis, no external data exfiltration or command execution.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n- Analysis: Standard AST utility functions, safe use of third-party libraries, no malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Safe, legitimate static analysis tooling.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. Confidence=1.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar purpose and sources.\n- No malicious activity or external communication.\n- No suspicious patterns.\n- Well-structured utility functions.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.95 (very low risk).\n- Confidence: 1.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Static analysis helpers.\n- No external or malicious actions.\n- Uses standard libraries, no suspicious patterns.\n- Slightly higher securityRisk=0.1, but still negligible.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n- Confidence: 0.95.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar utility functions.\n- No external communication or malicious behavior.\n- Safe use of AST and third-party libraries.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- Confidence: 1.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Utility functions for static analysis.\n- No malicious patterns, external effects.\n- Safe and standard usage.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n- Confidence: 0.95.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Presence of Malicious Behavior:** None of the reports identify any malicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation detected; code is straightforward.\n- **Potential Vulnerabilities:** The functions are static analysis helpers, not executing untrusted code or handling sensitive data in a way that could be exploited.\n- **Use of `ast.literal_eval`:** Standard for evaluating literals; safe in this context.\n- **Third-party Libraries:** `asttokens` and `domdf_python_tools` are used for source code tokenization and string handling, respectively, both in a benign manner.\n- **Security Risks:** Minimal; primarily utility functions for static analysis.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned in the reports seem reasonable given the code's nature.\n- The malware score should remain at 0, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- The obfuscated score is correctly at 0.\n- The overall security risk should be near zero, perhaps slightly above zero (e.g., 0.1) for the minimal concern about `ast.literal_eval`, but this is standard and safe in this context.\n\n### Final Summary:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, just noting the use of literal_eval)\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Overall, I agree with the assessments in the reports. The code is a benign utility module for static code analysis with no malicious intent or security risks.**",
