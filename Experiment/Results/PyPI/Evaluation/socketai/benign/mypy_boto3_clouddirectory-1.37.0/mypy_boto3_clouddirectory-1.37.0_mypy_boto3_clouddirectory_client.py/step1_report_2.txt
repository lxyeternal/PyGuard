{
  "purpose": "This code provides type annotations and a client class for the AWS CloudDirectory service, facilitating type-safe interactions with the AWS SDK for Python (boto3).",
  "sources": "The code reads input from imported modules, static class definitions, and method parameters, including environment checks for Python version compatibility.",
  "sinks": "Method implementations that could potentially process or handle untrusted input via kwargs, but they are primarily type annotations and method signatures without executable logic or data handling.",
  "flows": "The code flows from defining class structure, method signatures, and overloads, with no actual runtime data processing, making data flow analysis inapplicable for malicious data transfer.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present. The code contains standard type annotations, class properties, method signatures, and conditional imports based on Python version. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or code injection found.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines a type-safe client interface for the AWS CloudDirectory service, using static typing, method signatures, and overloads for paginators. It imports necessary modules and sets up exception classes. No data handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution present. The structure and content align with standard SDK interface definitions, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard type annotation and interface definition for a boto3 client, with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious operations. It is a legitimate SDK interface implementation for AWS CloudDirectory with no evident security risks.",
