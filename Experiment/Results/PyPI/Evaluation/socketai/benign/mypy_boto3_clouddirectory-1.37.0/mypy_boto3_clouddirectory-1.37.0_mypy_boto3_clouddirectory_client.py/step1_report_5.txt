{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface for AWS CloudDirectory service, providing a Pythonic way to interact with the AWS SDK.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from AWS SDK (boto3, botocore) and local type definitions and documentation strings. It does not include user input or external untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not send untrusted data over networks or write to files. It primarily defines a client interface with method signatures.",
  "flows": "Method calls are straightforward; data flows from input parameters to AWS SDK calls via method signatures. No explicit data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or unusual dynamic code execution are present. The code appears to be a standard type-annotated client wrapper for AWS SDK.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides type annotations, method signatures, and documentation for the CloudDirectory client. It imports standard libraries and AWS SDK components, defines exception classes, and sets up method overloads for paginators. There are no signs of malicious logic, data leaks, or obfuscated code. The structure is consistent with auto-generated SDK wrappers, focusing on static typing and documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured SDK interface with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It mainly facilitates type-checked interactions with AWS CloudDirectory service and does not contain any suspicious or harmful logic.",
