  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface for the AWS CloudDirectory service, facilitating type-safe interactions with the service's API.",
  "sources": "Import statements, type alias definitions, and method implementations within the CloudDirectoryClient class.",
  "sinks": "Method parameters and return values, especially where untrusted data could potentially be passed or returned (e.g., Params in generate_presigned_url, kwargs in service methods).",
  "flows": "Input parameters (such as Params and kwargs) flow into methods; methods return responses or URLs. No evidence of data being sent over networks outside of standard SDK behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. Use of type annotations and overloads is consistent with SDK development. No unusual code constructs or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of type annotations, method signatures, and class definitions for a boto3 client wrapper. All methods correspond to documented AWS SDK operations, with no signs of malicious payloads or data exfiltration. The code appears to be a standard SDK stub with type hints, paginator overloads, and exception mappings. No suspicious or malicious behavior found; the structure is consistent with an SDK interface. No dynamic code execution, hidden backdoors, or anomalous data flows identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard type-annotated SDK interface for AWS CloudDirectory. It contains no indicators of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It serves as a type-safe wrapper around boto3, with no suspicious behaviors or hidden functionalities.",
