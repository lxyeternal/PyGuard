{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class for the AWS CloudDirectory service, providing type-safe method signatures for SDK usage.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class definitions, method signatures, type annotations, and documentation links.",
  "sinks": "Method parameters (e.g., kwargs) used in API calls, potential for data flows from input to API calls or network transmission.",
  "flows": "Input data via method arguments flows into SDK API calls, but no explicit untrusted data processing or external data handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. Documentation links are benign. No obfuscated code features present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of type annotations, method signatures, and documentation references for the boto3 CloudDirectory client. It defines a client class with methods that correspond to AWS SDK operations, annotated with type hints for input parameters and return types. The 'exceptions' class wraps AWS error types. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, data leakage, network connections, or malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious logic, or obfuscation present. The code is consistent with standard SDK interface definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a type-safe interface for AWS CloudDirectory SDK and contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard, benign SDK wrapper with extensive type annotations, meant to improve developer experience and code correctness.",
