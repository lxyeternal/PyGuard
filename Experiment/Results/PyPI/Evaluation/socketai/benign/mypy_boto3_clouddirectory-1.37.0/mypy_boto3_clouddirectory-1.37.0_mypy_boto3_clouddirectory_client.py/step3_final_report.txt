  "purpose": "Type annotations and SDK interface for AWS CloudDirectory client, providing static type safety and documentation links.",
  "sources": "Method parameters (kwargs), imported modules, class attributes, and documentation links.",
  "sinks": "API call parameters and return types; no untrusted data handling or external data flow outside documented API signatures.",
  "flows": "User input via kwargs flows into AWS API methods; responses are typed return values or dicts.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive, statically-typed SDK wrapper for AWS CloudDirectory, with method signatures matching AWS API calls. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The imports are standard, and documentation links point to official AWS resources. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The data flow is limited to documented API parameters and responses, with no evidence of malicious intent or security flaws.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured SDK interface for AWS CloudDirectory, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It serves as a static type-safe wrapper to facilitate development and integration, and all indicators confirm its safety.",
