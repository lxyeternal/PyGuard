{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for the AWS CloudDirectory service, providing a typed interface to the boto3 client.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local modules; class and method definitions; string documentation links; type annotations; method signatures.",
  "sinks": "Methods that accept untrusted input via **kwargs (e.g., Params, kwargs: Unpack[...]) and return data structures; methods that generate URLs; potential data flows from input to output.",
  "flows": "User input via method parameters (kwargs) flows through client methods potentially into AWS services; return values are either dictionaries or typed responses. No evident malicious data flow or untrusted command execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No use of dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious variable names. Documentation links are harmless. No network connections or system commands are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a type-annotated wrapper around the boto3 CloudDirectory client, with method signatures and documentation. It leverages Python's typing system for better code clarity. No signs of malicious code, hidden backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The imports and method structures are standard for a SDK wrapper. The use of untrusted input parameters is confined to documented API parameters, consistent with SDK design. No network activity, system modifications, or data exfiltration mechanisms are implemented.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured, and benign SDK interface wrapper for AWS CloudDirectory. It does not contain any malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. The code's purpose is to provide type safety and better developer experience when interacting with AWS services.",
