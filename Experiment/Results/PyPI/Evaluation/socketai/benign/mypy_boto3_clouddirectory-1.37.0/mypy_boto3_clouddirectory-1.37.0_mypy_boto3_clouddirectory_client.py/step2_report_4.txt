  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a type annotations wrapper for AWS CloudDirectory SDK. No code execution or dynamic behavior, just static type annotations and method signatures.\n- **Flows & Sinks:** User input (kwargs) flows into API calls; return data is either dicts or typed responses. No evidence of malicious data handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code patterns, no obfuscated code, no backdoors, credentials, or network activity. The code is a standard SDK stub.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, purpose is to provide type safety. Malware score: 0. Obfuscated: 0. Overall risk: 0.95 confidence.\n\n**Assessment:** Completely benign SDK interface. No malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, describing a type-safe interface for CloudDirectory. Focuses on static class and method signatures.\n- **Flows & Sinks:** No runtime data processing, just method signatures and overloads.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors. Standard SDK wrapper.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard SDK interface. Malware score: 0. Obfuscated: 0. Overall risk: 1.0 confidence.\n\n**Assessment:** Same as above, benign SDK wrapper.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, a type-annotated client interface for AWS CloudDirectory.\n- **Flows & Sinks:** Parameters flow into API calls; no evidence of malicious data handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no dynamic code, credentials, or network activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard SDK interface, safe. Malware score: 0. Obfuscated: 0. Overall risk: 0.95 confidence.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious signs.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern: type annotations, method signatures, documentation references.\n- **Flows & Sinks:** Data flows are limited to API parameter passing; no untrusted data handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign SDK wrapper. Malware score: 0. Obfuscated: 0. Overall risk: 0.95 confidence.\n\n**Assessment:** Safe, standard SDK code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, providing type annotations and interface for CloudDirectory.\n- **Flows & Sinks:** No untrusted data flows or network activity beyond SDK calls.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no malicious logic.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard, benign SDK interface. Malware score: 0. Obfuscated: 0. Overall risk: 0.9 confidence.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** All reports describe a static, type-annotated SDK wrapper with no runtime logic, no data processing beyond method signatures, and no suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All scores are zero, matching the benign nature of the code.\n- **Logical Flaws:** No logical flaws or assumptions are evident; the reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n- **Risk Scores:** Given the nature of the code—an SDK interface with no executable logic, no network activity, and no dynamic code—risk scores should remain very low or zero.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious activity, payload, or backdoors detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Clear, straightforward, well-structured code with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** **0** — As a static SDK interface, the risk is negligible; no security vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent and accurate. No adjustments needed. The code is a benign, well-structured SDK wrapper designed for type safety and developer convenience.",
