  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Defines type annotations and data structures for AWS Cloud Directory SDK.\n- Content: Purely declarative, with no runtime logic, external data handling, or dynamic code execution.\n- Findings: No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- Confidence: 1.0\n- Malware: 0\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar to Report 1, focuses on type annotations for AWS SDK.\n- Content: Static type definitions, no external data processing, no runtime logic.\n- Findings: No signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.\n- Confidence: 1.0\n- Malware: 0\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Detailed type annotations for AWS Cloud Directory interactions.\n- Content: Pure type definitions, no dynamic code, no external data processing.\n- Findings: No malicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- Confidence: 1.0\n- Malware: 0\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Type annotations for AWS Cloud Directory SDK.\n- Content: Static data schemas, no runtime logic or external data handling.\n- Findings: No suspicious or malicious code detected.\n- Confidence: 1.0\n- Malware: 0\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Type definitions for AWS Cloud Directory operations.\n- Content: Purely declarative, no execution or external data handling.\n- Findings: No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- Confidence: 1.0\n- Malware: 0\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis:\n- **Code presence:** All reports confirm that the code is purely declarative, consisting of TypedDicts, Unions, and conditional imports for compatibility.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No signs of malicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or dynamic execution.\n- **External data:** The code does not process untrusted data at runtime; it only defines data schemas.\n- **Suspicious patterns:** No hardcoded secrets, code injection, or suspicious logic.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk, purely type annotations)\n\n### Justification:\nThis code is a static, well-structured set of type definitions for the AWS Cloud Directory SDK. It serves as a foundation for type safety and documentation, with no runtime logic, external data handling, or dynamic code execution that could pose security concerns. The consistent findings across multiple reports reinforce the benign nature of this module.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Estimated malware score:** 0\n- **Estimated obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Estimated risk score:** 0\n\nThis supply chain report indicates a safe, purely declarative module with no malicious intent or security issues.",
