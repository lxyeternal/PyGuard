{
  "purpose": "The code defines type annotations for AWS CloudDirectory service request and response structures using TypedDict and Union, facilitating type checking and IDE support for Python code interacting with AWS SDK.",
  "sources": "Type annotations are primarily read from class and variable definitions, including imported modules (sys, datetime, typing, botocore.response, .literals), and data structures initialized with TypedDict, Union, and class definitions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include data output to logs, network transmission of data structures (e.g., response payloads), or serialization to JSON/other formats for network communication.",
  "flows": "Data flows from source type definitions into functions or code that serialize, transmit, or log data. No explicit code flow logic or network operations are present; the code only defines data schemas.",
  "anomalies": "There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. All code appears to be straightforward type annotations and class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly comprises type definitions for a service SDK, with no runtime logic, data handling, or external interactions. The imports are standard and safe. No evidence of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The use of typing features is consistent and appropriate for type hinting. No obfuscated patterns or hidden payloads are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a purely declarative type annotation collection for AWS CloudDirectory SDK in Python. It contains no executable code, external data handling, or network interactions that could be malicious. Therefore, it poses no security risk or malicious intent.",
