{
  "purpose": "The code defines detailed type annotations and data structures for AWS Cloud Directory service interactions, including request and response types, for use with Python type checkers and documentation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data primarily from type annotations, class and variable definitions, and imported modules (sys, datetime, typing, botocore.response). No external user input or untrusted data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are the definitions of data structures used in API requests/responses; however, they do not execute code, handle untrusted data, or perform operations that could lead to data leaks or code execution.",
  "flows": "The flow involves structured data modeling; no runtime data flows from untrusted sources to sinks are implemented, as this is purely type declaration code.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a comprehensive and standard set of type definitions, with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Usage of Union and NotRequired indicates flexible data structures, but nothing abnormal or malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules for type annotations and conditional imports for compatibility, then defines numerous TypedDict classes and type aliases for AWS Cloud Directory API structures. There are no functions, runtime logic, or external data handling. The structure is consistent with type declaration files meant for static type checking and documentation. No suspicious or malicious patterns are evident, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The code's purpose is purely to formalize data schemas, which is typical for SDKs and API clients.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate set of type annotations and data structure definitions for AWS Cloud Directory SDKs. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. Its sole purpose is to facilitate static type checking and documentation, and there are no indicators of supply chain attacks or malicious behavior.",
