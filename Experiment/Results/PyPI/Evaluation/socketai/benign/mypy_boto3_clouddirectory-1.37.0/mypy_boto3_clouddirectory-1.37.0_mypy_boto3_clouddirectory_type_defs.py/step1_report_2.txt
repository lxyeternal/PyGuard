{
  "purpose": "This code defines type annotations for the AWS Cloud Directory service in Python, facilitating type checking and code clarity for SDK users.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external or untrusted input; it imports standard libraries, third-party modules, and defines data structures.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or perform actions based on external input; the code primarily sets data type schemas.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows are present as the code only declares type definitions; it does not execute logic or handle input/output operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. The code contains copyright and documentation comments, but no executable malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is composed of static type definitions using TypedDicts, Unions, and conditional imports based on Python version. It includes no dynamic execution, no network operations, and no handling of external data sources. The import statements and type annotations are standard and align with typical SDK type definitions. No signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads are detected. The file strictly contains data schemas for the AWS SDK, with no executable code or behavior that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is purely a set of type definitions intended for static type checking and documentation. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate, safe module defining data structures for AWS Cloud Directory SDK.",
