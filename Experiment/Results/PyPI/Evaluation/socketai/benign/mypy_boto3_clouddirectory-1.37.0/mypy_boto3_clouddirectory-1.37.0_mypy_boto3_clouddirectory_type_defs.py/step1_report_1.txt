{
  "purpose": "This code defines type annotations and data structures for the AWS Cloud Directory service, facilitating type-safe interactions and documentation clarity.",
  "sources": "The code reads type annotations from imports, sys.version_info for conditional imports, and the module's own type definitions and data structures.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include usage of external data (e.g., JSON documents in 'PutSchemaFromJsonRequestTypeDef' and 'PutSchemaFromJsonResponseTypeDef'), and the inclusion of any dynamically executed code or network calls (none observed).",
  "flows": "The data flow involves creating structured data (TypedDicts and Unions) that represent API request and response payloads, with no evidence of dynamic code execution or untrusted input handling within this file.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or malicious logic are present. The module is purely declarative, defining data structures and type hints.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of type definitions for the AWS Cloud Directory SDK, including TypedDicts, Unions, and conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. It does not perform any runtime logic, external data handling, or dynamic code execution. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscation. The inclusion of type annotations and structured data suggests an emphasis on type safety and clarity for developers integrating with AWS services.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe type annotation module for AWS Cloud Directory SDK. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or malicious data flows. Its purpose is to facilitate type-safe programming and documentation. Confidence is high that this is a benign, purely declarative module.",
