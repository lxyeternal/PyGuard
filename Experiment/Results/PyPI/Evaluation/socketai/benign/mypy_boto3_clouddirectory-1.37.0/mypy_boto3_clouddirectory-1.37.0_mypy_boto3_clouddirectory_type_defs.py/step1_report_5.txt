{
  "purpose": "Define detailed type annotations for AWS Cloud Directory service operations using TypedDict, Union, and other type hints to facilitate type checking and validation.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, sys, datetime, typing, botocore.response, and local literals; all type definitions and annotations within the module.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data; the code primarily sets up data structures and type hints.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code mainly defines data types and does not execute data flows or logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code patterns. The code is solely type annotation and data structure definitions, with no dynamic code execution, external network calls, or file manipulations.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly consists of type annotations using TypedDict, Union, and other typing constructs to describe AWS Cloud Directory data structures. It imports necessary modules safely, with version-aware conditional imports. There is no runtime code, no dynamic evaluation, and no side-effects or external dependencies beyond type hints. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code segments are present. The presence of docstrings and detailed type definitions suggests a well-structured library setup, not malicious code. Overall, the code is static and purely declarative, with no indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a comprehensive set of type definitions for a Python AWS SDK wrapper related to Cloud Directory. It contains no executable code, no network calls, or data manipulation logic. It does not demonstrate malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and appears to be solely for type annotation and code assistance.",
