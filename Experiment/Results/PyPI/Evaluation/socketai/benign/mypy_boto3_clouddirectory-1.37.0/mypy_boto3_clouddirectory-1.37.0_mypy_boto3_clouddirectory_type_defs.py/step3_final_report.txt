{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structures for AWS Cloud Directory SDK, serving as static type definitions for SDK support and documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, sys.version_info, internal literals, and type definitions; no runtime data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No runtime logic, data processing, or external data handling; only static type declarations.",
  "flows": "Static data schemas used for type checking; no dynamic data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns; code is declarative and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of TypedDicts, Unions, conditional imports for Python version compatibility, and type annotations for request/response structures. It contains no executable logic, external data processing, or dynamic code execution. The purpose is to provide static type safety for SDK modules. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "This dependency is a benign, standard SDK type annotation module with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. It is purely declarative, intended for static type checking and documentation support.",
