  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string (`__version__ = \"1.37.0\"`) with a comment indicating it's the source of truth.\n   - No external input, data processing, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - The copyright year (2025) is in the future but does not indicate malicious intent; it's likely a placeholder or a typo.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - No errors or flaws are identified across the reports.\n   - The code is minimal and standard for version declaration in Python packages.\n   - The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which is benign.\n\n3. **Scores Review:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which is appropriate given the straightforwardness of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports suggest any reason to assign a higher risk score.\n   - The code is purely declarative, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n5. **Malware and Obfuscated Scores:**\n   - Both are correctly set to 0, as there is no malware or obfuscation.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are consistent and based on the code's actual content.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores align well with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated Malware Score:** 0  \n**Estimated Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Estimated Security Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a minimal, static version declaration with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements. The future copyright year is not suspicious or malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports correctly identify this as benign boilerplate code for versioning. No changes to the scores are necessary. The code poses no security risks or malware concerns.",
