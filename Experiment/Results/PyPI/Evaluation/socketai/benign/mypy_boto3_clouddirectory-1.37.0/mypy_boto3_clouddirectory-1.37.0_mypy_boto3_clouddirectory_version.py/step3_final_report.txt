  "purpose": "Declare the package version as a static string for source of truth.",
  "sources": "Assignment of __version__ variable, no external input or data flow.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignment without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward. Minor note: future copyright year 2025.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static assignment of a version string with a comment and copyright notice. No dynamic code, input handling, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the benign nature. The only unusual aspect is the future copyright year, which is benign but might be a placeholder or oversight.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless version declaration with no security concerns or malicious intent. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity.",
