{
  "purpose": "Defines a version string for the package or module, serving as a source of truth for version information.",
  "sources": "The code itself assigns a version string to the __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only assigns a static string value to __version__.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a copyright statement with a future year (2025) may be unusual but not malicious; no other anomalies observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a copyright comment and a single assignment of a version string to __version__. There are no inputs, no data processing, no external interactions, and no complex logic. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The version number is static, and the copyright year is beyond the current date but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple version declaration with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It serves as metadata for the package/module and contains no harmful or suspicious elements.",
