  "purpose": "Defines a version string for the package or module.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points that could leak information or cause harm.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is simply assigning a version string.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns. The comment about 'Source of truth for version' and the copyright notice are typical and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns a version string '__version__' with value '1.37.0' and includes a comment about the source of truth and copyright information. No external data input, no processing, no dynamic code execution. The content appears standard for Python package versioning. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward version declaration with no malicious behavior or security concerns. It is typical boilerplate code used in Python packages.",
