  "anomalies": "No anomalies, secrets, or suspicious code present; only a version string and comment",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a docstring comment, a copyright notice, and a simple variable assignment of the version number. There are no input/output operations, no data processing, and no suspicious behavior. The version string is static and hardcoded, which is standard practice. No malicious or obfuscated code is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward declaration of package version with no malicious intent or security risks.",
