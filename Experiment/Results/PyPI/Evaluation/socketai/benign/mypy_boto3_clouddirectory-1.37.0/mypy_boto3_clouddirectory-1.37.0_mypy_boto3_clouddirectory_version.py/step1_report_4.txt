{
  "purpose": "Defines the version string for the package, serving as a source of truth for the package version.",
  "sources": "The assignment of the string '1.37.0' to the __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or interact with external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code merely assigns a constant value to a variable.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment block and a variable assignment for __version__. No input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, and no interaction with external systems are present. The comment indicates the source of truth for versioning and includes a copyright statement. The version string is hardcoded but not inherently malicious. Overall, the code is simple, straightforward, and standard for package versioning.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard version declaration with no malicious intent or security issues. It serves as a source of truth for package versioning without any suspicious behavior.",
