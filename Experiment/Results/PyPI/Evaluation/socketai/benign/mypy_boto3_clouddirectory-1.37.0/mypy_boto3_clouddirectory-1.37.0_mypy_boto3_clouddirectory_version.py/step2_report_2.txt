  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__` with accompanying comments and copyright notices.\n   - There are no signs of dynamic code execution, input/output operations, external data handling, or obfuscation.\n   - The code is static, simple, and typical for Python package versioning.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that the code is benign and standard.\n   - No logical errors or misconceptions are evident.\n   - The only minor point is the mention of the copyright year 2025, which is in the future relative to current dates, but this is not an error—just an unusual detail, not malicious.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports justify a risk score above 0.5, and given the code's benign nature, a risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity, nor does it contain vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign `malware`: 0.\n   - The code does not contain any malicious payload, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - The mention of the future year (2025) is noted but not considered suspicious or malicious.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent and appropriate for the described code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Overall, the code is a minimal, static version declaration typical in Python packages. There are no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements.**\n\n**Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (correctly identified as benign)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, harmless version string declaration with no security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Recommendation:** No changes needed. The code is safe, and the assessment is correct.",
