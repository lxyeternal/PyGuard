{
  "purpose": "Provides an interface for interacting with the AWS CloudDirectory service, including imports and paginator setup.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator), and usage examples demonstrating paginator creation via AWS SDK session.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or output, as code primarily involves module imports and variable assignments.",
  "flows": "Code imports modules, defines a class alias, and sets up module exports; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. Usage appears consistent with SDK documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary classes and functions for AWS CloudDirectory operations, defines a Client alias, and exposes these components via __all__. The usage example is documentation-style, illustrating how to instantiate paginators with a boto3 session. No dynamic execution, data processing, or external input handling is present. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward module setup for AWS CloudDirectory SDK usage, with no malicious intent or security risks evident. It serves as a clean interface for AWS SDK paginator operations.",
