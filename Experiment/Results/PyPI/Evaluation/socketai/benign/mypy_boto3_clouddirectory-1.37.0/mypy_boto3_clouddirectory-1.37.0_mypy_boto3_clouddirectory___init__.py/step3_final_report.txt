{
  "purpose": "This code provides module setup and documentation for AWS CloudDirectory SDK interaction, primarily importing classes and defining exports.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules and the example usage code demonstrating session and paginator creation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, external inputs, or network interactions are present.",
  "flows": "The code does not process external data; it only sets up class references and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The future copyright year (2025) is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, consisting of import statements, class aliasing, and documentation. It lacks dynamic execution, external data handling, or network activity. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The minimal risk score (around 0.0 to 0.1) assigned in previous reports is appropriate; given the benign nature, a risk score of 0.0 is most accurate. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0. All reports correctly identify the code as safe, with confidence scores reflecting certainty.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured SDK setup module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing scores are appropriate; the risk score can be refined to 0.0 for maximum accuracy.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
