  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a straightforward interface for AWS CloudDirectory SDK, with example usage.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data processing or external input handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; code is standard SDK setup.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, just module setup.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Risk 0.1 seems high for such benign code; malware score 0 is appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** The report is accurate. The code is safe; the low risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, standard module setup.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flow from untrusted sources.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Benign, standard code.\n- **Scores:** Risk 0, malware 0, consistent with the code.\n- **Verdict:** Correct assessment; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, typical SDK setup.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No handling of untrusted data.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; the only minor oddity is the copyright date (2025), which is in the future but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity; safe.\n- **Scores:** Risk 0.1 might be slightly high; perhaps 0.0 would be more precise, but it's not a major concern.\n- **Verdict:** The assessment is sound; no malicious intent detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clear SDK interface, documentation included.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or external commands.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior; the future copyright date is odd but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Safe, standard setup.\n- **Scores:** Risk 0.0 or 0.05 might be more appropriate, but 0.0 is acceptable.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate and cautious assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar benign SDK setup.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flow issues.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; the code is straightforward.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, safe.\n- **Scores:** Risk 0, malware 0, consistent.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Code presence:** The code is a typical Python SDK module setup for AWS CloudDirectory, with no dynamic execution, no data processing, and no external input handling.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of malware or obfuscation.\n- **Security risk:** Very low; primarily a module with documentation and class imports.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 to 0.1 (very low, given the benign nature)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate. The code is a standard, safe SDK interface with no security issues. The slightly elevated risk scores (0.1) are marginal; a more precise score would be 0, but the current scores are acceptable given the context.\n\n**My personal estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is purely structural, documentation, and import setup for AWS SDK usage.",
