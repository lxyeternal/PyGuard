{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator classes for boto3's clouddirectory client, providing type-safe iteration over paginated responses.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type definitions; no user input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows that handle untrusted input; the code defines classes and methods for iteration over known responses.",
  "flows": "Paginator classes and their paginate methods provide source-to-sink paths for paginated responses, but only within the library scope.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code strictly defines class structures and method signatures without side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of paginators with proper type annotations, extending the Paginator base class from botocore, with conditional typing based on Python version. No external data handling or dynamic code execution is present. The code adheres to expected patterns for boto3 stubs, with no signs of malicious intent or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation of boto3 paginator stubs for AWS CloudDirectory. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The structure and content are typical for auto-generated type annotations and paginator classes.",
