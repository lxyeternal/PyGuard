  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The report correctly identifies that the code defines paginator classes for AWS CloudDirectory with detailed type annotations, referencing the relevant SDK documentation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** The **kwargs** passed to `paginate()` are untrusted but are standard in SDK patterns; no data is processed or stored insecurely.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code structures, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected. The code is boilerplate for SDK wrappers.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment that this is benign, with high confidence (0.95), is accurate.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both scores are zero, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, the code is a type-safe wrapper for boto3 paginators, with conditional imports and detailed documentation links.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** The `paginate()` methods forward untrusted parameters directly; typical for SDK code, no malicious data handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious logic. The code appears to be auto-generated boilerplate.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The high confidence (1.0) is justified; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both scores are zero, matching the benign assessment.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern—standard paginator classes with type annotations, no external data processing.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No dangerous data sinks; parameters flow into SDK methods.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment is consistent; no risks identified.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both zero.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard SDK wrapper classes with type annotations, conditional typing.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data handling beyond typical SDK patterns.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or secrets.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is a benign, auto-generated type annotation layer.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both zero.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous reports—type-safe paginator classes for boto3.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No dangerous data flows or external command execution.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or secrets.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment of safety is accurate; no risks detected.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both zero.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** The code is purely structural, defining classes and methods for pagination with type annotations. It does not process or execute untrusted code or data.\n- **Malicious or Suspicious Behavior:** None detected. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n- **Potential Vulnerabilities:** The only potential concern is passing untrusted **kwargs** to SDK methods, but this is standard for SDK pagination and not inherently malicious.\n- **Scores Consistency:** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as zero, which is appropriate.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (standard, benign SDK wrapper code)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is a standard, auto-generated set of paginator classes for AWS SDK with comprehensive type annotations. It does not contain any malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements. The high confidence scores in the reports are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nNo changes needed. The code is safe and well-structured for its purpose.",
