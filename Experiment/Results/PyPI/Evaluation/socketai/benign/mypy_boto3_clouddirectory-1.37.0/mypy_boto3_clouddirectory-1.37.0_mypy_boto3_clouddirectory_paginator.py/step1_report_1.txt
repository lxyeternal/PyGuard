  "purpose": "Define paginator classes for AWS CloudDirectory client with type annotations and documentation links.",
  "sources": "Imports from botocore.paginate, type_defs module, and code that defines classes with methods that invoke 'paginate' with **kwargs.",
  "sinks": "The 'paginate' methods accept **kwargs, which could potentially include untrusted input; however, these are standard AWS SDK patterns. No other untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The 'paginate' method receives **kwargs from external callers, which are passed directly to the underlying Paginator's 'paginate' method, potentially allowing untrusted parameters but no malicious code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code structures detected. The code appears to be standard boilerplate for AWS SDK paginator classes with type annotations and documentation. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a series of paginator classes for AWS CloudDirectory with detailed type annotations and documentation links. The classes inherit from Paginator and override the 'paginate' method to accept various parameter types. The use of 'Unpack' and type hints is consistent with safe type-annotated code for SDK wrapper classes. No suspicious logic, hidden behaviors, or malicious constructs are identified. The code is purely structural, focused on type-safe API wrappers. No external data is processed, transformed, or exfiltrated beyond standard SDK pattern.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign set of paginator class definitions with comprehensive type annotations and documentation links. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
