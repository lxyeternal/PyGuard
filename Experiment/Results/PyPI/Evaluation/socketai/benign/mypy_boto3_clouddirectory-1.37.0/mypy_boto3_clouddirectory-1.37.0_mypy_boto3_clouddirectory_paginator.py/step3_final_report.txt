{
  "purpose": "Defines type-annotated paginator classes for AWS CloudDirectory SDK, providing structured, documented access to paginated responses.",
  "sources": "The 'kwargs' passed to the 'paginate' methods, originating from user input or external calls to the SDK's paginator methods.",
  "sinks": "The 'kwargs' are forwarded directly to the underlying boto3 Paginator's 'paginate' method; no data is processed or stored insecurely.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow from the 'paginate' method into the SDK's paginator, resulting in paginated response streams; no external or untrusted data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code structures, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected. The code is boilerplate for SDK type safety.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple paginator class definitions for AWS CloudDirectory, each inheriting from a generic Paginator with type annotations. The 'paginate' methods accept untrusted kwargs and pass them directly to the SDK's paginator, which is standard practice. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious logic is present. The code is auto-generated boilerplate aimed at providing type safety and documentation links. No external data leaks, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of SDK wrapper classes for AWS CloudDirectory paginators. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements. The high confidence scores in the reports are justified, and no changes are necessary.",
