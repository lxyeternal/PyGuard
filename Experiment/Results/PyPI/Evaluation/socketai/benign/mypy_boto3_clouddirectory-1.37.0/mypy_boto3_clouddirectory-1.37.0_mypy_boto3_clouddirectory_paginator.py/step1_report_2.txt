{
  "purpose": "Provides type annotations and paginator classes for boto3's clouddirectory service, facilitating type-safe pagination of API responses.",
  "sources": "Imports from botocore.paginate, type_defs module for request/response types, and system version info for conditional imports.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; code mainly defines classes and methods with type annotations, no data leaks or untrusted data processing detected.",
  "flows": "User calls 'paginate' methods with kwargs; these are passed unaltered to the underlying Paginator.paginate method, returning PageIterator objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hidden behavior, or obfuscated logic. Use of type annotations and dynamic class definitions appears standard. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a series of paginator classes inheriting from a generic Paginator base, each with a 'paginate' method that forwards keyword arguments to the base 'paginate' method, returning a PageIterator. The classes are conditionally typed based on TYPE_CHECKING. All classes and methods are documented with links to boto3 documentation and their stub equivalents. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data manipulation, or suspicious dynamic execution. The code appears to be a straightforward, type-safe API wrapper implementation for boto3 paginators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured type annotation layer for boto3 paginator classes, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It mainly enhances type safety and developer convenience.",
