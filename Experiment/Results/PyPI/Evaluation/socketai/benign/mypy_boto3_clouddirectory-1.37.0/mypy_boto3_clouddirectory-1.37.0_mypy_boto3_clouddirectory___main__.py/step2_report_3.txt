  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**1. Presence of issues in the code:**\n- The code is straightforward, consisting of simple CLI output functions and argument handling.\n- No signs of code anomalies, dynamic execution, external network activity, or data leaks.\n- The code only reads command-line arguments and outputs static strings.\n- **Conclusion:** The reported issues are *not* present in the code.\n\n**2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning:**\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with high confidence (1), and no malicious activity detected.\n- They correctly identify the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior.\n- No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident in the reports.\n\n**3. Scores assigned to each issue:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n- These are appropriate given the static, straightforward nature of the code.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, which seems reasonable.\n- **Suggestion:** The scores seem consistent and justified.\n\n**4. Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n- The highest scores are 0 for malware and security risk.\n- No issues justify a higher risk score.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores are appropriate.\n\n**5. Malware score considerations:**\n- No malicious behavior, code injection, or external communications are present.\n- The code does not perform any suspicious operations.\n- Malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n**6. Claims based on assumptions:**\n- All reports are cautious and base their conclusions on static analysis.\n- No unwarranted assumptions are evident.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores with the report:**\n- All scores align with the code's behavior.\n- No discrepancies.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is a simple CLI utility that outputs static information.\n- No external or malicious activity detected.\n- The code is transparent, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is benign. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** No further action needed; the code is safe.",
