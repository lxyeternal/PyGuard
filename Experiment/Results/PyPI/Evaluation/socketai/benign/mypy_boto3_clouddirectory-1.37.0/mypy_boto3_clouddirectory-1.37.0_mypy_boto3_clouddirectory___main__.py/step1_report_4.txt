{
  "purpose": "Provides CLI commands to display package information and version details for a specific Python package.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv) to determine user requests.",
  "sinks": "Writes output to stdout using sys.stdout.write(). No untrusted data is processed or written back to the system.",
  "flows": "User input (CLI args) triggers print_version or print_info functions, which output static information.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. The code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code simply checks for a '--version' argument and outputs predefined package info or version. It uses standard libraries (sys) and no external dependencies or dynamic code execution. No data leakage, malicious behavior, or suspicious activities are present. The functions are purely informational with static outputs. No obfuscated code, no unusual control flow, and no suspicious network activity.",
  "conclusion": "This script functions as a benign CLI utility providing package info and version. There are no signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks.",
