  "purpose": "A minimal CLI script that outputs static package information or version details based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line argument input",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for outputting static strings",
  "flows": "sys.argv check (source) to sys.stdout.write (sink) when '--version' is present",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and contains no suspicious patterns or dynamic behavior",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI utility that prints package info or version based on command-line input. It imports only sys, uses direct string outputs, and performs no external network activity, dynamic code execution, or data handling beyond static strings. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present. All five reviews correctly identify the code as benign, straightforward, and free of malicious behavior, with high confidence (1). The scores assigned—malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0—are appropriate given the code's simplicity and static nature. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected, and the logic is clear and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static CLI utility with no malicious intent or security risks. All reviews are accurate, and the assigned scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
