  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - The code is a straightforward CLI script that prints static package info or version based on command-line arguments.\n   - It imports only `sys`, uses simple functions to output fixed strings, and has no dynamic code execution, external network calls, or data handling beyond command-line argument checking.\n   - The logic is simple, with no obfuscation, no secrets, and no suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Issues Present in the Code:**\n   - The code is benign and matches the descriptions in all reports.\n   - No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n   - No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.\n   - The code is consistent across all reports.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are accurate and consistent with the code.\n   - They correctly identify the code as a simple, static CLI utility with no malicious intent.\n   - No errors or logical flaws in the reports themselves.\n\n4. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n   - No need to adjust these scores.\n\n5. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - All reports assign a `securityRisk` of 0, which is justified.\n   - The code does not perform any risky operations.\n   - No external dependencies, no network activity, no dynamic code execution.\n   - Therefore, risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n6. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware score is 0 in all reports.\n   - This is correct; the code does not contain malicious behavior.\n\n7. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n8. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - All reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable score assignments.\n\n**Final Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct, no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct, code is straightforward)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct, no security risks)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\nGiven the entire analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is a simple, static CLI utility with no malicious intent or security issues.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Score |\n|------------------|--------------|\n| Malware          | 0            |\n| Obfuscated       | 0            |\n| Security Risk    | 0            |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, benign, and poses no security threat. The reports are accurate and consistent. No changes are necessary.",
