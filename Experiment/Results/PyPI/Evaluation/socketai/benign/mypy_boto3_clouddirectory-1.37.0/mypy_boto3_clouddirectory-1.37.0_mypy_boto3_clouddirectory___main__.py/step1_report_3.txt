  "purpose": "CLI entry point for printing package information and version details.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments; sys.stdout for output.",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write outputs data; no other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input from sys.argv potentially triggers print_version, then output flows to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. No obfuscated code, unsafe data handling, or malicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it processes command-line arguments and prints package info or version. There are no external data inputs beyond command-line arguments, and output is only printed to stdout. No data leakage, network activity, or malicious logic observed. The code functions as a simple CLI utility with no apparent security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic CLI script that prints static information. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, and poses no security risks.",
