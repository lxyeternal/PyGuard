  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static package info or version.\n- It reads command-line arguments via `sys.argv`.\n- If `--version` is present, it outputs the version; otherwise, it outputs package info.\n- It performs no external network activity, dynamic code execution, or data processing beyond static strings.\n- The code is straightforward, well-structured, and contains no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities:** None detected.\n- **Malware:** Score 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscation:** Score 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Security Risk:** Score 0, as the code does not handle sensitive data or perform risky operations.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- No flaws or mistakes are evident in the reasoning of the reports. All reports correctly identify the code as benign and straightforward.\n\n### Score Justification:\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are reasonable given the code's simplicity.\n- The confidence level of 1 is justified, as the analysis is consistent and thorough.\n\n### Potential for False Positives:\n- The code does not perform any suspicious activity, so any claim of vulnerabilities or malware would be unfounded.\n- The reports correctly dismiss any malicious or obfuscated behavior.\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks)\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\nBased on the detailed review, I would **maintain the current scores**:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a benign CLI utility with no signs of malicious activity or security issues.",
