  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static package information or version details.\n   - It uses `sys.argv` to detect if `--version` is passed.\n   - It writes output to `stdout` via `sys.stdout.write()`.\n   - No external network connections, dynamic code execution, or data processing beyond static strings.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n\n2. **Report Summaries:**\n   - All five reports agree that the code is straightforward, benign, and performs only static I/O operations.\n   - No anomalies, malicious behaviors, or security risks are identified.\n   - Confidence is high (1) in all reports.\n   - Malware scores are consistently 0, indicating no malicious activity detected.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, confirming the code is clear and understandable.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Discrepancies:**\n   - No issues found in the code or reports.\n   - The logic and reasoning in the reports are sound and consistent with the code.\n   - The scores are reasonable and reflect the benign nature of the script.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - Since the code is static and only outputs predefined information, there's no need to adjust scores.\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as safe and non-malicious.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n| Metric            | Score | Justification                                              |\n|-------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0      | No malicious activity or behavior detected.                |\n| Obfuscated        | 0      | Code is clear, straightforward, no obfuscation.            |\n| Risk              | 0      | No security risks or vulnerabilities identified.           |\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a simple, static CLI utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate and consistent. No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n**Note:** If I were to assign my own scores based on the analysis, they would match the existing ones:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis confirms the code is safe and benign.",
