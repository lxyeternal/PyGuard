{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a command-line interface entry point that outputs package information or version details based on user input.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv and writes output to sys.stdout.",
  "sinks": "Outputs information to stdout; no sinks indicating data leaks or external connections.",
  "flows": "User input (command-line args) -> main() -> print_version() or print_info() -> stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed. The code performs straightforward I/O operations without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys to handle command-line arguments and output. It defines two functions, print_info() and print_version(), which output static package info and version respectively. The main() function checks if '--version' is in sys.argv; if so, it calls print_version(), otherwise calls print_info(). The script executes main() if run as __main__. The code is simple, with no external network access, no dynamic code execution, and no handling of untrusted data beyond command-line argument check. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward CLI utility for displaying package info and version. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior and poses no security risk.",
