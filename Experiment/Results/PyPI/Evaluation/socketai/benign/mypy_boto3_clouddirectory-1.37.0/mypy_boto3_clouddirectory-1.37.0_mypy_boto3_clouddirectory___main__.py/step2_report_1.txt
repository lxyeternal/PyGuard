  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n**1. Code Review:**\n\n- The code is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static package info or version based on command-line arguments.\n- It imports only `sys`, uses straightforward functions, and has no external dependencies.\n- No dynamic code execution, no network activity, no handling of untrusted input beyond argument checking.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n- The logic is simple, clear, and well-structured.\n\n**2. Report Consistency:**\n\n- All five reports uniformly describe the code as benign, straightforward, and free of malicious behavior.\n- They correctly identify that the script only outputs static information based on command-line input.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or external data flows are reported or observed.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, indicating high certainty.\n\n**3. Scores and Justifications:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified as there's no evidence of vulnerabilities, data leaks, or malicious activity.\n\n**4. Critical Evaluation:**\n\n- The reports are accurate; the code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code is static and simple.\n- The command-line argument handling is standard and safe.\n- The outputs are static and do not involve untrusted data or external calls.\n\n**5. Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**6. Additional Comments:**\n\n- The code is a benign utility with no security concerns.\n- The reports correctly identify the absence of malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my evaluation:**\n\n| Metric            | Score | Justification                                              |\n|-------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0      | No malicious activity or code patterns detected.            |\n| Obfuscated        | 0      | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation present.            |\n| Security Risk     | 0      | No vulnerabilities, data leaks, or malicious intent.       |\n\n**Final recommendation:** The report scores are appropriate; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If I were to assign scores independently, I would concur with the reports' assessments. The code is safe, simple, and free of malware or obfuscation.",
