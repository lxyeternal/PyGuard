  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for a package that provides information about boto3 CloudDirectory and its version.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (reads command-line arguments), sys.stdout.write (outputs information to stdout)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write outputs data; no other sinks present",
  "flows": "Command-line input (sys.argv) triggers output functions (print_version or print_info) which write static information to stdout",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code; straightforward command-line logic",
  "analysis": "The script serves as a CLI tool that outputs package information or version based on user input. It reads command-line arguments and writes static text to stdout. There are no external data sources, no network activity, and no sensitive data handling or injection points. No suspicious logic, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only outputs static package information and version details, with no external dependencies or malicious intent.",
