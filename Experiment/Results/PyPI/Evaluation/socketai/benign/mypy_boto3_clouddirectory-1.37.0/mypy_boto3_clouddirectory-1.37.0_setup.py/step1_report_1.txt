  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for packaging a Python library related to boto3 CloudDirectory with type annotations.",
  "sources": "The script reads the README.md file for the long description and reads package metadata from the script itself.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no external data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Input from filesystem (README.md) flows into package metadata; no external or untrusted data flows into code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code structures are detected. The script solely performs standard package setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python setup script using setuptools. It reads a markdown file for long description, defines package metadata, dependencies, and project URLs. There are no indications of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. It does not execute external commands, process untrusted input, or contain obfuscated code. All operations are static and standard for packaging Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate setup configuration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
