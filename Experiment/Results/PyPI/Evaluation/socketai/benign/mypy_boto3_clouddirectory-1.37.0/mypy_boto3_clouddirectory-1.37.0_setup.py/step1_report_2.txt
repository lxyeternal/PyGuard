  "purpose": "Setup script for publishing the mypy-boto3-clouddirectory package with metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Read the README.md file for long description; static package metadata and dependencies defined in setup()",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data sources or external input processing",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual constructs; standard setuptools setup script with no dynamic or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The script imports pathlib and setuptools, reads a local README.md file for long description, and calls setup() with static package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no dynamic code execution, and no network activity. The only file operation is reading a local markdown file. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. The script follows a standard pattern for Python package setup, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It performs typical package configuration tasks without any suspicious or malicious code.",
