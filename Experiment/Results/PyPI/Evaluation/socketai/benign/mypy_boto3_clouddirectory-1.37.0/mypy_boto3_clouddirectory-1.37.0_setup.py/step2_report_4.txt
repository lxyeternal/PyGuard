  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing their conclusions with the code and considering the scoring rationale.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools.\n- It reads a local README.md for long description.\n- It defines package metadata, dependencies, and URLs.\n- No untrusted input, external commands, or dynamic code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- All reports confidently conclude the script is benign with no security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Potential Issues:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code is straightforward and aligns with typical setup scripts.\n- **Malicious activity:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- **External data handling:** Only reads a local file (`README.md`), which is safe.\n- **Dependencies:** Declared explicitly; no dynamic dependencies or code.\n\n### Scoring Analysis:\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk Score | Justification |\n|---------|---------|--------------|--------------|----------------|\n| 1       | 0.0     | 0.0          | 0.0          | No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected. |\n| 2       | 0.0     | 0.0          | 0.0          | Standard setup; no external or untrusted data. |\n| 3       | 0.0     | 0.0          | 0.0          | Typical package configuration, no suspicious code. |\n| 4       | 0.0     | 0.0          | 0.0          | No anomalies; purely static setup script. |\n| 5       | 0.0     | 0.0          | 0.0          | No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. |\n\nAll reports assign a malware score of 0 and a risk score of 0, which is consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?** Yes. The code is a static, well-formed setup script with no malicious indicators.\n- **Is there any overlooked vulnerability?** No. The code does not execute untrusted input, does not contain obfuscated code, nor interacts with external systems.\n- **Potential assumptions:** Some reports mention reading files or static metadata, which are standard practices. No assumptions about malicious behavior are justified here.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 (no security risks)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** All reports are consistent and accurate. No adjustments needed.",
