  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging a library, reading local README.md for description, and defining package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; static data in setup() parameters.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs processed.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static code with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script utilizing setuptools to package a Python library. It reads a local README.md file for the long description and calls setup() with static metadata, dependencies, and URLs. There are no dynamic code executions, external data sources, user inputs, or network activities. The code structure is simple, clear, and adheres to standard practices. No secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present. All signals indicate benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identified its safe nature, and the scores are consistent with the code's static and straightforward structure.",
