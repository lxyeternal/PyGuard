{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package, primarily used to define package metadata and dependencies for distribution via package managers like PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; importing setuptools; no external input or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "Calling setup() function with package metadata; no data sinks involved that could lead to data leakage or code execution outside standard package setup.",
  "flows": "Reading description -> passing metadata to setup() -> package installation; no suspicious data flow or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded credentials or secrets, no obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python package setup script using setuptools. It reads a local README file for long description and specifies package metadata such as name, version, author, description, classifiers, and dependencies. There are no external data inputs other than static file reads, and no code executes beyond the standard setup process. All dependencies are declared explicitly. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard, benign Python package setup file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely to facilitate package distribution with no apparent vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
