{
  "purpose": "Setup script for publishing the mypy-boto3-clouddirectory package, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description, imports from pathlib and setuptools, and contains hardcoded package information.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "Reads static file content into LONG_DESCRIPTION, then passes package configuration to setup(). No untrusted data flows or external execution paths are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors detected. The script performs standard package setup operations.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, reads a local file for description, and calls setup() with package metadata. All operations are typical for Python package setup scripts. No malicious or maliciously obfuscated code, backdoors, or data leaks are apparent. The code does not perform network operations, execute untrusted code, or handle sensitive information.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It simply prepares package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
