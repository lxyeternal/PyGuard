  "purpose": "Defines static Python type literals for AWS SDK enumerations, resource names, paginator names, and service identifiers to facilitate type checking and improve developer tooling.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'Literal' and the declaration of string literal type aliases for various AWS SDK constants.",
  "sinks": "No data input/output, external interactions, or runtime data handling; purely static constants.",
  "flows": "None; static definitions without data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of static string literal type definitions, with conditional import for 'Literal' based on Python version. It contains no runtime logic, external data handling, or dynamic code. The extensive list of literals serves as type annotations for AWS SDK components, improving type safety and developer experience. No anomalies or security concerns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static module providing type annotations for AWS SDK literals. It serves an auxiliary purpose without any malicious intent or security risks.",
