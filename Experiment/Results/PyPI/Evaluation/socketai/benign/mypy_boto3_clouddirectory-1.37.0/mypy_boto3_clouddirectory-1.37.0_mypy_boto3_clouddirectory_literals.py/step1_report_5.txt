{
  "purpose": "Define type literals for AWS CloudDirectory service and related constants, facilitating type safety and autocompletion in Python code.",
  "sources": "The source code reads no external input or data; it solely defines constants and type annotations.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks, code execution, or other vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists involving untrusted sources; this module only provides static type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code is straightforward and only defines literals.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a conditional import of 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version, then defines multiple Literal type aliases for AWS CloudDirectory and related constants. There are no functions, dynamic code execution, input handling, or other suspicious behaviors. The structure is simple and purely declarative, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of type annotations for AWS SDK literals, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign static configuration module intended for type safety.",
