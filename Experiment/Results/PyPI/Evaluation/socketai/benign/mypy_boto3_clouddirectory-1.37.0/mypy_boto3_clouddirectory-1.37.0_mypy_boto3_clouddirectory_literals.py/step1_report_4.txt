  "purpose": "Define Python type literals for AWS CloudDirectory service and related resources to facilitate type checking and validation.",
  "sources": "Read-only definitions of string literals for various AWS resource types, service names, and pagination identifiers.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows are present; the code only declares constants.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink flows; this is purely a set of type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code adapts import based on Python version, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is mainly a collection of string literal type definitions for use with type hints. It includes conditional import for 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version. The __all__ list enumerates all exported symbols. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or data handling is present. There are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation; the code is straightforward and standard for type definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a benign set of Python type annotations for AWS CloudDirectory and related services. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It serves purely as a type definition module.",
