  "purpose": "Define type annotations for AWS CloudDirectory service literals using Python's type hinting system.",
  "sources": "Type annotations are declared directly as string literals assigned to variables; no external data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output to external systems; code strictly defines type constants.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines constants and types.",
  "anomalies": "The code is purely type definitions with no dynamic or executable logic; no anomalies or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'sys' module to conditionally import 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version. It then defines a large set of string literal types representing AWS service, resource, paginator, and region names. All definitions are static, constant assignments without any data processing, user input handling, or external interactions. The initial comments provide documentation and usage examples. No code attempts to read input, write output, or perform any network or file operations. The purpose appears solely to facilitate static type checking in Python projects involving AWS SDKs.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a straightforward collection of type alias definitions for AWS service literals, with no suspicious, malicious, or security-related code present. It serves as a static typing aid and contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
