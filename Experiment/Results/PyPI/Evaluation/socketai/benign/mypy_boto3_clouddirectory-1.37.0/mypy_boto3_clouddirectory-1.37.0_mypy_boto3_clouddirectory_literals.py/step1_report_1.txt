  "purpose": "Define Python type literals for AWS SDK service enumerations and paginator names to enable type checking and improve code clarity.",
  "sources": "Import statements, sys.version_info check, and literal definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process untrusted input or perform data manipulation.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code solely declares constants for type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code is a straightforward type definition module.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with a docstring explaining the purpose, including usage examples and licensing info. It conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version, which is standard practice. The main body defines multiple literal types representing AWS resource names, paginator names, service names, and other enumerations. These are static, predefined strings used for type annotations, with no runtime logic, data handling, or external interactions. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are detected. The module appears to serve as a type annotation utility for AWS SDK stub generation or validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, purely declarative module providing type literals for AWS SDK enumerations. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It functions solely to improve type safety and developer experience when working with AWS SDK in Python.",
