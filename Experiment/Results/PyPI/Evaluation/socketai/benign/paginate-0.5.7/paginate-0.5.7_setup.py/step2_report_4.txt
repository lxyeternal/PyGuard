  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the logic, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package, with no dynamic or untrusted data, no obfuscation, and no malicious behaviors.\n- The code reads static files, defines package metadata, and calls `setup()` — standard practice.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, external code execution, or data flows from untrusted sources are detected.\n- The malware scores are all zero, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The security risk scores are low (mostly 0 or 0.1), which is reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and evaluations:\n\n**1. Are the reported issues present?**  \nYes. The reports correctly identify that the code is a standard setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n**2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \nNo. The reasoning is sound, and the conclusions are justified based on the code content.\n\n**3. Are the scores reasonable?**  \n- Malware scores are all 0, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, matching the clear, straightforward code.\n- Security risk scores are mostly 0, with one report at 0.1, reflecting minimal concern due to static file reads.\n\n**4. Justification for higher risk scores?**  \nNo report assigns a high risk score. The minimal 0.1 score could be justified as a conservative placeholder, but given the code's simplicity, even 0.1 might be slightly high; however, it's acceptable.\n\n**5. Consistency of scores with the code?**  \nYes. All scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Additional critical points:\n\n- The code does not perform any dynamic operations, external inputs, or code execution.\n- The file reads are static and not influenced by external untrusted sources.\n- The setup configuration is standard and benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the detailed review, I concur with the reports' conclusions.**  \nThe code is a typical, safe setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n**My own estimates for scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| **0**   | **0**        | **0** |\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- Malware: 0, no malicious code or behavior.  \n- Obfuscated: 0, code is straightforward.  \n- Risk: 0, standard setup script with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately.",
