  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly states that the code is a straightforward setup script with no suspicious behavior, no dynamic code execution, and no external untrusted data sources.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent with the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues identified.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the static nature of the setup script, reading files, and no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — the risk score is very low, indicating minimal concern, possibly due to the inherent nature of setup scripts but not due to any suspicious content.\n- **Note:** The risk score of 0.1 is slightly above zero, perhaps reflecting the minimal inherent risk in package setup scripts, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are detected.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports; standard setup script with no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion; standard, benign setup code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Also aligns with prior analyses; no suspicious or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, and the code contains no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, and the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Nearly all are 0, with one at 0.1, reflecting the minimal inherent risk of package setup scripts.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no dynamic code execution, no external untrusted input, no obfuscated or malicious code.\n- The minimal risk score (0.1) in one report is acceptable, given the nature of setup scripts, but since no actual vulnerabilities or suspicious behaviors are present, it could be adjusted to 0.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, standard boilerplate for Python package setup, with no security risks or malicious intent.",
