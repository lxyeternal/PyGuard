  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the assigned scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is a standard Python package setup script, reading static documentation files and configuring package metadata via setuptools.\n- All reports agree that there are no suspicious behaviors, no dynamic code execution, no external inputs, no obfuscated code, and no malware indicators.\n- The code does not contain any hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n- The scores assigned to malware are all zero, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The security risk scores are low (mostly 0 or 0.1), which seems appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Validations:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues or malicious behaviors are present in the code.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None are evident. The code is straightforward and standard.\n- **Scores assigned:**\n  - Malware: 0 in all reports, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n  - Obfuscated: 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n  - Security risk: mostly 0, with one report assigning 0.1, which is acceptable given the minimal risk.\n\n### Critical assessment:\n\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is benign.\n- The reasoning is sound: static file reads, static setup parameters, no dynamic or external data, no suspicious constructs.\n- The scores are reasonable; no need to increase them.\n\n### Justification for higher scores:\n\n- Since no malicious activity or obfuscation is detected, the malware score should remain at 0.\n- The obfuscated score is also correctly 0.\n- The security risk score could be slightly above 0 if considering the potential for supply chain issues, but given the code's benign nature, 0 or 0.1 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — standard setup script, minimal security risk.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a typical, benign setup script with no security concerns. The assigned scores are appropriate, and there is no need to escalate the risk levels.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are thorough and correct. The code poses no security threat, and the scores reflect that accurately.",
