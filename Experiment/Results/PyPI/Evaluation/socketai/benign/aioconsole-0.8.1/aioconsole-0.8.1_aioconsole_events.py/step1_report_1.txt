  "purpose": "Define an interactive event loop class for running a Python console with optional network server support, integrated with asyncio.",
  "sources": "Imports asyncio, functools, local modules 'server' and 'console'; class attributes; constructor parameters; functions creating coroutines and tasks; asyncio event loop settings.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of user-defined coroutines, creation of server and console instances, asyncio task scheduling, and setting event loop policies.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> factory functions -> coroutine creation -> ensure_future or run_until_complete -> asyncio event loop execution -> set_event_loop -> run_forever.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically creates and manages console and server instances; no suspicious hardcoded secrets or malicious code evident; no obfuscated code present; standard asyncio patterns used.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a customizable interactive console environment using asyncio event loops and optional server support. It uses standard asyncio constructs like ensure_future, run_until_complete, and set_event_loop. No embedded or hidden network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious commands are present. The dynamic creation of consoles and servers appears legitimate for interactive development or debugging purposes. The code manages tasks and cleanup properly and does not execute any external or untrusted code directly. Overall, the structure and behavior are consistent with a benign utility for interactive sessions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of an asyncio-based interactive console with optional server hosting. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It appears safe and standard for development tools.",
