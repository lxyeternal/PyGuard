{
  "purpose": "Defines an interactive event loop and policy for asynchronous console interaction within an asyncio environment.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (asyncio, functools), accesses self attributes, calls external functions (server.start_interactive_server, server.print_server, console.AsynchronousConsole.interact).",
  "sinks": "Potentially executes console interaction coroutines, which could involve user input; calls external server start function that may listen on network ports.",
  "flows": "Initialization of console or server, creation of coroutines (console.interact, start_interactive_server), scheduling via asyncio.ensure_future, setting event loop policy, and running the loop.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code; uses standard asyncio patterns. No obfuscated code, unnecessary dynamic execution, or misleading variables.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a custom asyncio event loop that either runs an interactive console or starts a network server for console interaction. It relies on external server and console modules, which are assumed to be standard or benign. No suspicious data handling, insecure network operations, or hidden behaviors are evident. The use of asyncio ensures asynchronous, non-blocking behavior, and the code manages resources appropriately. No malicious or maliciously crafted code is observed. The code's purpose is to facilitate interactive sessions, which inherently involve user input and network communication, but these are standard practices and not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to implement a standard, interactive asyncio event loop with optional network server support. No signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected. It is a typical implementation of an async console interface.",
