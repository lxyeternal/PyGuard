{
  "purpose": "Provides an asyncio-based interactive console with optional network server support for debugging or user interaction.",
  "sources": "Imports standard asyncio modules, local server and console modules, reads configuration parameters for server host/port, and user-provided locals and prompts.",
  "sinks": "Creates console and server coroutines, schedules tasks, and manages event loop; no external data transmission or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Initialization of console and server, scheduling of coroutines via ensure_future and run_until_complete, user input handling, and server start-up functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected. Use of lambda is standard, no obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up an asyncio event loop with optional network server support for interactive consoles. It manages tasks properly, uses standard asyncio patterns, and does not perform any suspicious or malicious actions. The network server component could potentially be misused if exposed publicly, but within this code, it functions as intended for debugging or remote interaction. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The overall structure is clear and aligns with typical development tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of an asyncio-based interactive console with optional server support. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are evident. The modest security risk score reflects the network capabilities but does not indicate any actual threat.",
