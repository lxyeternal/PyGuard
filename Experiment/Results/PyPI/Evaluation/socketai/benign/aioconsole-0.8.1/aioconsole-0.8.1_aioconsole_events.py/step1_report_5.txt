{
  "purpose": "Provides an interactive event loop class that integrates with asyncio for running a console interface, either locally or via a server.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (server, console), user-provided parameters for serve, locals, banner, prompt_control.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that lead to untrusted data leak or external system effects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user input or network (serve parameter) into console interactions; no external untrusted data sinks are evident.",
  "anomalies": "Uses dynamic function creation via functools.partial and asyncio.ensure_future; no suspicious hardcoded secrets or unusual code constructs. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up an interactive console, either locally or over a network, with proper use of asyncio constructs. It initializes event loops and policies, manages console interactions, and handles cleanup. All operations rely on standard asyncio patterns and local module functions, with no evidence of malicious actions such as data exfiltration, system manipulation, or hidden backdoors. The code appears designed for safe interactive use, leveraging asyncio for concurrency, with no suspicious code pathways or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of an asyncio-based interactive console, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It uses common patterns for event loop management and console interaction without any suspicious behaviors.",
