  "conclusion": "The script does not contain malicious code but has inherent security risks due to executing external startup scripts and passing unvalidated arguments to subprocesses. The risk is moderate, primarily from potential code injection if environment variables or inputs are compromised. The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.4."
