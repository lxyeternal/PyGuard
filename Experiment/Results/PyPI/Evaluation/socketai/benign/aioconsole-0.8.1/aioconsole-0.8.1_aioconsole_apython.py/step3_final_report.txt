  "purpose": "This script provides a command-line interface for running Python files or modules with a customized asyncio policy, supporting an interactive console, server options, and environment configurations.",
  "sources": "Environment variable PYTHONSTARTUP, command-line arguments, external startup files, user inputs for subprocess arguments",
  "sinks": "exec() on PYTHONSTARTUP and startup files, subprocess invocation with user-controlled arguments",
  "flows": "Reading PYTHONSTARTUP -> exec() execution; User inputs/arguments -> subprocess command construction",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on external files without validation, subprocess commands built from unvalidated user input",
  "analysis": "The code executes external startup scripts via exec() based on environment variables, which can be malicious if the environment is compromised. It also constructs subprocess commands with user inputs, posing command injection risks. No malicious payloads are present, but the potential for malicious code execution exists. The code is straightforward and readable, with no obfuscation. The primary security concern is executing untrusted external code, which could be exploited if environment variables or inputs are maliciously controlled.",
  "conclusion": "The script does not contain malicious code but has inherent security risks due to executing external startup scripts and passing unvalidated arguments to subprocesses. The risk is moderate, primarily from potential code injection if environment variables or inputs are compromised. The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.4.",
