{
  "purpose": "The code provides compatibility helpers for different Python versions.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'sys' module and 'sys.platform' attribute.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code does not process untrusted data or interact with external systems.",
  "flows": "Reads from the 'sys' module; no data flow to external systems or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal, standard, and lacks suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'sys' module to determine the current platform and assigns 'sys.platform' to a variable. It is a typical compatibility pattern. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward and follows standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving a compatibility purpose with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
