  "purpose": "Provide compatibility helpers for different Python versions by checking the platform.",
  "sources": "Reads data from sys.platform via import sys and assignment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "Import sys -> assign sys.platform to variable 'platform'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is minimal, straightforward, and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the sys module and assigns sys.platform to a variable, serving as a simple compatibility utility. It does not process untrusted data, execute external commands, or communicate over networks. The code is clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs. All signals indicate benign, standard behavior. No vulnerabilities, malicious actions, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for checking the platform. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The scores are appropriate and consistent with its benign nature.",
