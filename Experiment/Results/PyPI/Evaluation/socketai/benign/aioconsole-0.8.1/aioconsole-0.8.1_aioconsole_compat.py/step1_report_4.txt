  "purpose": "Provide compatibility helpers for different Python versions",
  "sources": "sys.platform, sys module import",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no data leaks or untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "Input from sys module (platform info), no flow to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; simply importing sys and assigning sys.platform without further processing or side effects",
  "analysis": "The code imports the sys module and assigns sys.platform to a variable named platform. This is a standard practice for compatibility checks across Python versions. There are no suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated behaviors. No user input, no external data sources, and no sensitive operations are performed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and benign, intended for compatibility purposes. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
