  "purpose": "Provide compatibility helpers for different Python versions.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'sys' module and 'sys.platform' attribute.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not handle untrusted input or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only imports a module and assigns a variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behaviors detected; minimal code with standard library usage.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'sys' module and assigns 'sys.platform' to a variable named 'platform'. There are no dynamic code executions, no hardcoded credentials, no data leaks, and no malicious behaviors. The code appears to be a simple utility to check the operating system platform for compatibility purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and intended for compatibility handling. No malicious intent or security risks are present.",
