  "purpose": "Provides compatibility helpers for different Python versions.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the sys module, specifically sys.platform.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process untrusted data or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "Reads platform information from sys.platform; no data flows to sinks or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is minimal and standard for compatibility checks.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the sys module, retrieves the platform identifier, and stores it in a variable. It appears to be a standard compatibility utility without any suspicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs are present. The code does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign utility for handling compatibility across Python versions. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
