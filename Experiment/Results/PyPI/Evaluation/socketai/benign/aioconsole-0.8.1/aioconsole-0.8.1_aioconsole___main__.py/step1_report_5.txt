{
  "purpose": "The code imports and executes a function named run_apython from a local module named .apython.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .apython module, invocation of run_apython()",
  "sinks": "Execution of run_apython() which may execute arbitrary code defined within that function",
  "flows": "Import from .apython -> run_apython() execution",
  "anomalies": "The code relies on an external function run_apython without context. The function could perform any operation, including malicious activities if malicious code is inside the module.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing a single function from a local module and executing it. Without inspecting the contents of run_apython(), it's impossible to determine its behavior. The code itself does not contain malicious logic but could trigger malicious behavior depending on the implementation of run_apython(). The structure is straightforward, but the security risk depends entirely on the imported function.",
  "conclusion": "The code by itself is simple and appears to execute a function from a local module. Its safety depends on the implementation of run_apython(), which cannot be assessed here. There is no immediate evidence of malicious intent within this snippet, but reliance on external code always carries risk.",
