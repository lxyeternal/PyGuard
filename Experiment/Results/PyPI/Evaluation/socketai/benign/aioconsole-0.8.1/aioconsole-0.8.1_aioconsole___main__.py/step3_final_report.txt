  "purpose": "The code imports and executes the function run_apython from a local module, with no additional logic.",
  "sources": "Import from a local module (.apython), then calling run_apython()",
  "sinks": "Execution of run_apython() which may perform any internal actions depending on its implementation",
  "flows": "Import from .apython -> call run_apython()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and call, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal: it imports a function from a local module and executes it immediately. The security implications depend entirely on the implementation of run_apython, which is unknown. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The code itself appears benign, but external code could be malicious. Malware score is set to 0 due to lack of evidence, and security risk is low (around 0.2-0.3) reflecting reliance on external implementation. Confidence is moderate (0.6), acknowledging uncertainty about run_apython's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign in structure; the main concern is the behavior of run_apython, which cannot be assessed here. The low malware and risk scores are appropriate given the snippet. No malicious activity is evident, but external dependency warrants caution.",
