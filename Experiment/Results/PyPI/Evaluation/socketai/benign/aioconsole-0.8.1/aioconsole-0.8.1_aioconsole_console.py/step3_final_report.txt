{
  "purpose": "Provides an asynchronous Python console supporting 'await' syntax, with custom compile and execute functions, signal handling, and stream management.",
  "sources": "Reads input from streams via stream.ainput(), which feeds into the push() method, ultimately compiled and executed through execute.compile_for_aexec and execute.aexec.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows from user input through push() into runsource(), which compiles and executes code; output and traceback are written back via self.write().",
  "flows": "Input (stream.ainput) -> push() -> runsource() -> execute.aexec -> output (write), with exception handling and traceback formatting.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious external communication. Uses external modules 'stream' and 'execute' but their content appears standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a legitimate asyncio-based interactive console, with proper exception and signal handling. Custom compile and execute functions are used but are consistent with the console's purpose. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. External modules are assumed safe; the overall structure is clear and purpose-driven.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, legitimate asynchronous Python console with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The low security risk score reflects inherent risks in executing arbitrary code but no specific vulnerabilities are evident.",
