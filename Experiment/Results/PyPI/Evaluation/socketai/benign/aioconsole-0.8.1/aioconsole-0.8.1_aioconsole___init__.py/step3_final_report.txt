  "purpose": "This module provides asynchronous equivalents to input, exec, and interact functions, along with an interactive event loop and CLI.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: execute, console, stream, events, command, server, apython",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are evident; the code mainly re-exports functions and classes",
  "flows": "The module imports functions/classes and exposes them via __all__, with no data flow involving untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected; the code is straightforward and well-structured",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple re-export module for asynchronous console and event loop functionalities. No malicious or insecure practices are apparent. The provided reports are empty, offering no specific concerns or vulnerabilities. Given the lack of evidence, the code appears benign, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The scores should reflect minimal risk and no malware suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured interface module with no indications of malicious intent or security issues. The empty reports do not raise concerns. Therefore, the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is minimal (0.1).",
