  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report, confirm the presence or absence of issues, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides async equivalents to input/output, handles streams, uses threading for blocking calls, and manages stream compatibility. No malicious or obfuscated code is detected.\n\n- **Analysis & Scores:**\n  - **Malware:** 0 — aligns with the analysis; no malicious activity.\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent.\n  - **Risk:** 0.2 — low, given no security concerns, but some complexity due to threading and stream handling.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The report's scores seem reasonable. The low risk score is justified given the use of threading and stream management, but no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes async I/O, uses threading for blocking calls, and custom classes. No malicious behavior is evident.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - **Malware:** 0 — consistent.\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 — code clarity.\n  - **Risk:** 0 — no security issues.\n\n- **Justification:** The use of `run_in_executor` and threading is standard for async wrappers around blocking I/O. No suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on async input/output, uses threading to emulate async stdin, no malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - **Malware:** 0 — appropriate.\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0.\n  - **Risk:** 0.1 — very low, justified by the threading approach.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The low risk score is justified; no malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Describes platform compatibility, stream management, and safe async handling. No malicious or obfuscated code.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - **Malware:** 0.\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0.\n  - **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, given the code's purpose and structure.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights the replacement of blocking input with async functions, safe stream handling, no malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - **Malware:** 0.\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0.\n  - **Risk:** 0.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Fully aligned with the code's intent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0; the code is standard, safe, and does not exhibit malicious patterns.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0; the code is transparent.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation, mostly low (0.1–0.2), justified by the threading and stream handling complexity but no real security threat.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — very low, primarily due to complexity but no actual security concern.\n\n**Summary:** The code appears to be a well-implemented async I/O utility for console interactions, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the analysis.",
