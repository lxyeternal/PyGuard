{
  "purpose": "Provides asynchronous equivalents to standard input and output functions, enabling non-blocking console interactions in asyncio-based Python applications.",
  "sources": "Reads input from sys.stdin or custom stream objects via run_as_daemon; writes output to stream objects, including custom stream classes and pipes.",
  "sinks": "Streams where data is written, such as sys.stdout, sys.stderr, or custom pipes; potential for data leakage if streams are malicious, but no network or data exfiltration code present.",
  "flows": "Input functions invoke run_as_daemon to execute blocking stream.readline or stream.read; output functions write to stream objects, then call drain; data flows from user input through run_as_daemon to asyncio Futures, then to streams.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns; threading is used to adapt blocking I/O for asyncio, which is standard but adds complexity; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements asyncio-compatible console I/O by wrapping blocking stream operations in threads via run_as_daemon, ensuring non-blocking behavior. Compatibility checks and resource management are handled carefully. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The threading approach, while adding complexity, is a known pattern for integrating blocking I/O with asyncio. The code is transparent, well-structured, and purpose-driven for async console interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for asynchronous console I/O in Python, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The low malware (0), obfuscation (0), and risk (0.1) scores are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
