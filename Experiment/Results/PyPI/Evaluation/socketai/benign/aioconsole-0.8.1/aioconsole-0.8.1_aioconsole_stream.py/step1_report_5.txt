{
  "purpose": "Provides asynchronous input and output functions for standard streams, replacing the blocking input() with non-blocking, coroutine-based implementations.",
  "sources": "Reads from sys.stdin, sys.stdout, sys.stderr, and stream objects passed to functions like ainput and create_standard_streams.",
  "sinks": "Writes to stream objects (stdout, stderr) via write() and drain(), and reads input data via readline() from stdin.",
  "flows": "Streams are obtained (either standard or custom), prompts are written to the output streams, then input is read from stdin asynchronously, returning user input.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. Use of threading and asyncio is standard for asynchronous I/O. No suspicious network activity or obfuscation detected. All code appears consistent with asynchronous stream handling.",
  "analysis": "The code replaces synchronous input with asynchronous functions, managing streams via asyncio and custom classes. It carefully handles standard and non-standard streams, using thread-based wrappers for non-file streams, and ensures proper cleanup. The design does not include any network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior. No hidden or suspicious functions are detected, and the code’s structure aligns with legitimate asynchronous input/output implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured asynchronous replacement for input() and print() functions, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It facilitates async input/output handling in Python environments, especially useful in asyncio-based applications.",
