{
  "purpose": "The code provides asynchronous equivalents to standard input/output functions, mainly to enable non-blocking console interactions within asyncio applications.",
  "sources": "Reads data from sys.stdin, stream objects, and pipes for input prompts; writes prompts and output data to stream objects.",
  "sinks": "Writes to stream objects, potentially including user-supplied streams or pipes. Also reads from stdin or other stream sources.",
  "flows": "Input prompt is written to the writer stream, then data is read asynchronously from the reader stream. Output is sent to the writer stream.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; the code appears to handle streams in a standard way. Use of `weakref.finalize` is standard. The code attempts to handle non-file streams and pipe compatibility, but nothing unusual is evident.",
  "analysis": "The module provides async implementations for input and print, utilizing asyncio streams and threads to avoid blocking. It includes compatibility checks for pipes, and custom stream classes to handle non-file streams. The core functions manage stream creation, prompt display, and reading input data in an asynchronous manner. The code leverages threading to run blocking stream read functions without blocking the event loop, wrapping results in futures. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns, backdoors, or suspicious network activities are present. Usage of weak references and custom classes is standard and justified for async stream management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of asynchronous input/output functions with stream compatibility handling. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected. It appears to be safe and intended for improving asyncio console interactions.",
