  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Purpose:** Standard async CLI extension with benign commands.  \n- **Sources/Sinks:** User input via 'readsource', output via 'write'. No external network or file operations.  \n- **Flow:** User input parsed with shlex, matched to commands, executed as coroutines.  \n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation. Use of 'SystemExit' is typical.  \n- **Analysis:** The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior. It functions as a typical CLI interface.  \n- **Conclusion:** Safe, no malware, no security risk.  \n- **Confidence:** 0.9  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Purpose:** Similar CLI with commands help, list, exit.  \n- **Sources/Sinks:** Reads from 'source', outputs via 'write'. No network or external data.  \n- **Flow:** Same as above, parsing input, matching commands, executing coroutines.  \n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, standard use of 'SystemExit'.  \n- **Analysis:** Standard, safe implementation. No malicious behavior detected.  \n- **Conclusion:** Safe, low security risk (~0.1).  \n- **Confidence:** 1  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Purpose:** Asynchronous CLI with commands, argument parsing.  \n- **Sources/Sinks:** Input via 'source', output via 'write'.  \n- **Flow:** Similar command parsing and execution flow.  \n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, obfuscation, or network activity.  \n- **Analysis:** Well-structured, standard CLI code. No malicious patterns.  \n- **Conclusion:** Very low security risk (~0.2).  \n- **Confidence:** 0.9  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Purpose:** Standard async CLI with commands help, list, exit.  \n- **Sources/Sinks:** Input via 'source', output via 'write'.  \n- **Flow:** Same command parsing and execution flow.  \n- **Anomalies:** Use of 'SystemExit' is common but should be monitored. No secrets or obfuscation.  \n- **Analysis:** Typical CLI pattern, no suspicious activity.  \n- **Conclusion:** Safe, benign, low risk (~0.1).  \n- **Confidence:** 0.9  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Purpose:** Similar CLI pattern.  \n- **Sources/Sinks:** User input, output via 'write'.  \n- **Flow:** Command parsing and execution as expected.  \n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, obfuscation, or network activity.  \n- **Analysis:** Standard implementation, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Conclusion:** Safe, low risk (~0.2).  \n- **Confidence:** 0.9  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, code injection, or suspicious behavior.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected.  \n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation, but all are very low (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting minimal security concerns.\n\n### Final conclusion:\n\nThe code is a standard, well-structured asynchronous CLI extension with benign commands. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The use of 'SystemExit' for control flow is typical for CLI programs and does not constitute a risk in this context.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (a very low, acceptable level of security concern)\n\n**Summary:** The code appears safe, with no malicious or suspicious elements. It functions as a typical CLI extension without any security issues.",
