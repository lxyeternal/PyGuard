{
  "purpose": "Provides an asynchronous implementation of exec and eval by transforming code snippets into coroutines and executing them within a controlled environment.",
  "sources": "Source string input, token stream for string literals, compile() function, AST parsing, local namespace dictionary.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic code compilation via compile(), execution via exec(), printing results, updating local namespace with execution results.",
  "flows": "Source code is tokenized and parsed into AST, validated for 'return' and 'yield' statements, wrapped into coroutine functions, compiled, and executed; results are captured and stored in local namespace.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or covert channels detected. The code relies on standard modules and techniques for dynamic code execution without sanitization, which is expected given its purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code transforms input source code into AST, performs safety checks to prevent 'return' and 'yield' outside functions, wraps code into an async coroutine, and executes it asynchronously. It manages local variables and captures output. No malicious or obfuscated code is present; the main security concern is executing untrusted code, which is inherent to such utilities. The use of compile() and exec() on untrusted input is standard but risky. The code is well-structured, with explicit validation steps, and does not contain malicious payloads or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a transparent, well-structured utility for asynchronously executing code snippets. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The primary security risk stems from executing untrusted code, which is inherent to its design. The security risk score should be high but justified, around 0.75, reflecting the potential danger without indicating malicious intent.",
