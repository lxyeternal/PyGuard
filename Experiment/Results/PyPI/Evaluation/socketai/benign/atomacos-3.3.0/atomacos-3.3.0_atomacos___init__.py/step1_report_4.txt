  "purpose": "Automated testing on macOS for accessibility and application control using atomacos library.",
  "sources": "Imports from atomacos library and accessors for native UI elements and errors.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code only imports modules, defines error aliases, and assigns class methods to variables.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; no execution of untrusted input or external commands.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed. Code appears to be a straightforward wrapper for macOS accessibility functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules from 'atomacos', defines error aliases, and assigns several class methods to variables for app control and UI interaction. No user input, external data, or system modifications are present. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs are detected. The code appears intended for automated testing or scripting purposes, with no signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for macOS automation using the atomacos library. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on its content.",
