  "purpose": "Utility class for converting macOS-specific CoreFoundation and accessibility data types into Python native structures.",
  "sources": "External system API calls such as CFGetTypeID, AXUIElementGetTypeID, NSSizeFromString, NSPointFromString, NSRangeFromString, NSRectFromString.",
  "sinks": "None; internal data processing without external communication or system modification.",
  "flows": "Type identification via CFGetTypeID and AXValueGetType, followed by conversion functions and regex parsing to produce Python data structures.",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex pattern '{.*}' for extracting data from string representations; potential fragility if input is malformed or malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs type checks and conversions based on system API functions, converting complex macOS data types into Python namedtuples. Regex is used to extract string representations, which could be fragile but is standard for such conversions. No network activity, code injection, or malicious behavior is present. The code is straightforward and relies on external system APIs for legitimate purposes. The main concern is robustness against malformed input, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for data conversion with no malicious or sabotage elements. The use of regex parsing introduces minor fragility but does not constitute malicious behavior. The assigned malware score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minor concerns about input handling. Overall, the code is safe for use in supply chain contexts.",
