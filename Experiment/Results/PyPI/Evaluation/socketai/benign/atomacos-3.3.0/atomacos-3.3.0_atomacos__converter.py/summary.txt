  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for data conversion with no malicious or sabotage elements. The use of regex parsing introduces minor fragility but does not constitute malicious behavior. The assigned malware score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minor concerns about input handling. Overall, the code is safe for use in supply chain contexts."
