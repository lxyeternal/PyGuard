  "purpose": "A utility function factory for filtering objects based on attribute patterns or exact values.",
  "sources": "The function `match_filter` takes keyword arguments used as criteria; the returned `_match` function accesses object attributes via `getattr`.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code only reads object attributes and performs pattern matching locally.",
  "flows": "Input criteria (kwargs) flow into `_match`, which compares object attributes to these criteria, returning True or False.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation, no obfuscation, no suspicious patterns, no external data access.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a factory function that creates a matcher function. The matcher compares object attributes to specified patterns or values, using `fnmatch` for string matching. It handles missing attributes gracefully by returning False. The implementation is simple, standard, and does not perform any external operations or contain hidden behaviors. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The logic is correct and safe for its intended purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for filtering objects based on attribute criteria. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; however, the one report with a security risk score of 0.1 should be adjusted to 0 for consistency. Overall, the code is safe and non-malicious.",
