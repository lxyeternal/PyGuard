  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for filtering objects based on attribute criteria. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; however, the one report with a security risk score of 0.1 should be adjusted to 0 for consistency. Overall, the code is safe and non-malicious."
