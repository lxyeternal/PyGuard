{
  "purpose": "This code wraps Objective-C accessibility calls for Python, primarily to interact with macOS accessibility APIs and raise Python exceptions on error.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function arguments such as application IDs, elements, notifications, attributes, actions, and positional coordinates.",
  "sinks": "The code calls API functions that return error codes and values; these are checked and returned or raise exceptions. No data is written to external systems or network.",
  "flows": "Input arguments are passed to API functions; error codes are checked, and on success, values are returned. On failure, exceptions are raised via errors.check_ax_error.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. The code is straightforward API wrapper with error handling. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, no hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a clean, direct wrapper around macOS accessibility API calls. It captures API calls, checks error codes against known error mappings, and raises exceptions if errors occur. There are no signs of malicious data handling, network activity, or backdoors. The functions do not perform any unintended actions beyond API calls and error handling. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic are present. The overall structure and flow are consistent with safe API wrapping.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard wrapper for macOS accessibility APIs with proper error checking. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code appears to serve its intended purpose without issues.",
