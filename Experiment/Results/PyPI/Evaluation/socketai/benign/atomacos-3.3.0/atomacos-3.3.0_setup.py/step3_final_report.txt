  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration script for 'atomacos'.",
  "sources": "Static data defining package info, dependencies, and metadata.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, user input, or external data sources.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static code, no obfuscation, no secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup.py script generated by 'flit' but using 'distutils.core.setup'. It contains no dynamic code, user input, network activity, or obfuscation. All dependencies and metadata are hardcoded statically. No suspicious patterns, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The script's purpose is to package the project; it does not perform any runtime actions or data processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package configuration script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, which are appropriate given the static, non-malicious nature of the code.",
