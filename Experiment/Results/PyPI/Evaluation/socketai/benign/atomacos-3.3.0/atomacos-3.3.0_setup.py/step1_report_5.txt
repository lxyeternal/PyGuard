{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package named 'atomacos', intended for distribution and installation.",
  "sources": "Reads static package metadata, dependencies, and package data from hardcoded variables; no external data inputs are read at runtime.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the script only defines package metadata and dependencies without executing or handling untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the setup process uses predefined static data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation observed. The script uses standard setup patterns with no suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python setup script using distutils for package configuration. It specifies dependencies, package data, and metadata without executing external code or user input. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data exfiltration are present. The dependencies listed are standard for a Python package that interacts with macOS GUI and system frameworks. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py script is benign, standard, and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It serves to package and distribute the 'atomacos' Python module with specified dependencies.",
