{
  "purpose": "This setup.py script is used to configure the package metadata and dependencies for the 'atomacos' project, enabling its distribution and installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads package specifications, dependencies (install_requires and extras_require), and metadata fields such as name, version, description, author, and URL.",
  "sinks": "The primary sink is the setup() function which uses the provided data to configure package installation; no untrusted data is directly written or executed.",
  "flows": "Input data such as dependencies and metadata flow into the setup() function, which processes these inputs to prepare package distribution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code uses standard setup pattern with no suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script imports distutils.core.setup, defines package info, dependencies, and metadata, and calls setup() with these parameters. The dependencies are version-restricted but are standard package dependencies, with no indication of malicious intent. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is typical for a Python package setup file.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
