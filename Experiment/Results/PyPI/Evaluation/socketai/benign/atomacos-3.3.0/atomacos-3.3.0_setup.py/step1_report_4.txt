  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the Python project 'atomacos' with specified dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "User input is not directly read; dependencies are specified in static lists/dicts, and metadata is hardcoded.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the script primarily defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks; the code is static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'distutils.core' for setup, which is outdated but not suspicious; no hardcoded secrets or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward setup configuration for packaging a Python project. It imports no external input, defines dependencies, and calls setup() with static metadata. No code execution based on untrusted input, no obfuscated or malicious code, no network activity or system modifications detected.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py appears legitimate and solely used for packaging purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
