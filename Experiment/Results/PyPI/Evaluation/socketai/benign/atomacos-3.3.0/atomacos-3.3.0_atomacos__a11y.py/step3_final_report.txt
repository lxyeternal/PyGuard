  "purpose": "A macOS accessibility API wrapper enabling GUI automation, application control, and system interactions.",
  "sources": "System API calls such as PAXUIElementCopyAttributeValue, PAXUIElementPerformAction, get_running_apps, and process identifiers.",
  "sinks": "Calls to system APIs that perform actions or retrieve data based on input parameters like process IDs, app names, or screen positions.",
  "flows": "Input data (app IDs, positions, app names) flows into system API functions which perform actions or retrieve attributes, returning results or modifying system state.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is straightforward and serves legitimate automation functions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard wrapper around macOS accessibility APIs, used for GUI automation, app launching, termination, and info retrieval. It interacts with system APIs in a controlled manner, with no signs of malicious intent. No obfuscation or suspicious anomalies are present. The functions are typical for automation utilities, and the scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's purpose and potential misuse if exploited. The confidence in this assessment is high (0.9).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate macOS automation utility with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score reflects potential misuse if misapplied, but the code itself is benign. All reports are consistent and accurate; no modifications are necessary.",
