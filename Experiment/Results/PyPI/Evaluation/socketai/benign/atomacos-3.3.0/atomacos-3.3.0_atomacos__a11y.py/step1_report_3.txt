{
  "purpose": "Provide an interface to interact with macOS accessibility features, control applications, and retrieve application information.",
  "sources": "Reading application process IDs, bundle IDs, window positions, attributes, and actions through system APIs; accessing running applications and frontmost application info.",
  "sinks": "Calling system APIs that perform actions on applications (e.g., activate, launch, terminate); retrieving application attributes and performing actions which could potentially control other applications.",
  "flows": "Input from system APIs (e.g., process IDs, application attributes) flows to internal methods that perform actions or retrieve data; potential malicious behavior could involve triggering application control or data retrieval.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes extensive access to macOS accessibility APIs, which could be exploited to control or monitor other applications. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. No obfuscated or malicious-looking code patterns are detected. The use of system APIs is standard for this kind of tool.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured API wrapper for macOS accessibility and application control, with methods to get running apps, interact with GUI elements, and launch/terminate apps. It uses standard system APIs and does not contain obfuscated code or hidden behaviors. No indications of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or unauthorized system control. Its capabilities could be used maliciously if misused, but inherently, the code itself appears to serve legitimate automation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides legitimate functions for macOS application and accessibility control. There are no clear signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or harmful code. Its potential for misuse depends on user intent, but the implementation itself appears benign.",
