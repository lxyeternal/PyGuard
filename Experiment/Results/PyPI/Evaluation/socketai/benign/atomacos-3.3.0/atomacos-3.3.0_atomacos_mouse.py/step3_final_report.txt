  "purpose": "Import various mouse control functions from the pyautogui library for GUI automation.",
  "sources": "Import statements from pyautogui module, specifically importing mouse control functions.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only imports functions and does not process untrusted data or perform actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution occurs within this snippet; only import statements are present.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of '# flake8: noqa: F401' comment to suppress unused import warnings; no malicious or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for mouse control functions from pyautogui, with no function calls, data processing, or execution logic. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and low security risk scores (mostly 0, with a slight 0.1 in one case). The code is straightforward and intended for GUI automation. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious intent are evident. The potential for misuse exists if functions are invoked maliciously later, but as-is, the code is safe. The scores are consistent with this assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement for GUI automation functions with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware and risk, with high confidence in this evaluation.",
