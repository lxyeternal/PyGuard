{
  "purpose": "This code provides an import interface for various mouse control functions from the pyautogui library, likely for automating mouse actions.",
  "sources": "No explicit data sources; the code imports functions, but no input or data reading occurs here.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling; the code simply imports functions for later use.",
  "flows": "There are no active data flows or execution paths in this snippet, as it only contains import statements.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a noqa comment to suppress linting warnings for unused imports, which could be normal or suspicious if used for obfuscation. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a set of mouse automation functions from pyautogui without executing any actions. It appears to be a preparatory step for automating mouse operations. No data input, output, or suspicious behavior is evident. The use of noqa suggests the imports might be unused in this fragment but could be utilized elsewhere. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leakage in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign import statement block for mouse automation functions. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks within this code fragment.",
