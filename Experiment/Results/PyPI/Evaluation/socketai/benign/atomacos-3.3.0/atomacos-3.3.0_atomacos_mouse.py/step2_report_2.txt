  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward import of mouse control functions from pyautogui.\n- No functions are invoked; the code is purely import statements.\n- No evidence of data flow, execution, or network activity.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior noted.\n- The code appears benign and intended for GUI automation.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The scores for malware are all 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- The security risk scores are also mostly 0, with a few at 0.1, justified by the fact that imported functions could perform system actions if called.\n- Confidence scores are high (mostly 1), indicating the reviewers are certain about the benign nature.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward import statements.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The reports mention the use of `# flake8: noqa: F401`, which suppresses warnings about unused imports. This is standard in some codebases but could be used to hide unused code or for obfuscation, although not necessarily malicious.\n- No report suggests any suspicious intent or malicious activity beyond the benign import.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- The scores assigned seem appropriate given the code snippet and context.\n- Since the code is only imports, the malware score should remain 0.\n- The security risk score is justified as low, but slightly above zero in some reports due to the potential of the imported functions to perform system actions if used maliciously later.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks evident.\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments needed unless future code calls or behaviors are introduced.\n\n---\n\n### Final conclusion:\n**Estimated malware score:** 0  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Estimated risk score:** 0.1 (to account for potential misuse if functions are invoked maliciously later, but current code is harmless)\n\nThis conservative approach aligns with the current evidence and the nature of the code snippet.",
