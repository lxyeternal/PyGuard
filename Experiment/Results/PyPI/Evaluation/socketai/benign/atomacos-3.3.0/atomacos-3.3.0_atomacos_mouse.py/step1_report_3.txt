  "purpose": "This code imports mouse control functions from the pyautogui library, likely to automate or simulate mouse actions.",
  "sources": "No direct data input or external data sources are read within this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "The imported functions can perform actions on the system's mouse, potentially affecting user input or automation processes.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports functions and does not execute any data flows or function calls.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed. The import is straightforward and legitimate.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a set of mouse control functions from the pyautogui library, which are used to perform various mouse actions such as clicking, dragging, scrolling, and moving the cursor. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling within this snippet. The import statement itself is standard and does not indicate malicious behavior. Since no functions are invoked, no malicious activity is occurring at this stage. The code is potentially part of an automation script or utility that manipulates the mouse.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement used for mouse automation with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It is a standard import from a known library without any suspicious elements.",
