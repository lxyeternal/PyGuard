  "purpose": "This code provides an import statement for mouse control functions from the pyautogui library, likely to automate or simulate mouse actions.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the pyautogui module, which provide access to various mouse control functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this code only imports functions without executing any data flow or logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward import statement with a 'flake8' directive, no hidden or unusual code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple mouse control functions from pyautogui, a common library for GUI automation. The import is explicit and does not include any dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. There are no sources of untrusted input, no data flows, and no sinks that could lead to security issues. The comment disables a linter warning for unused imports, indicating that the code might be part of a larger script that uses these functions. Overall, the code appears benign and standard for GUI automation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement for mouse control functions from pyautogui. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The script seems to be set up for automating mouse actions, with no signs of malicious intent.",
