  "purpose": "This code imports various mouse control functions from the pyautogui library to automate mouse actions.",
  "sources": "Import statements of functions from the pyautogui library; no user input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Usage of imported functions could potentially perform mouse movements or clicks, but no direct malicious sink is evident in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow is present; this is only an import statement setup.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of import statements; no suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a set of functions related to mouse automation from the pyautogui library. There are no data inputs, no execution logic, or data flows; it's a straightforward import block. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The functions could be used maliciously if called with malicious intent, but the code itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement for mouse control functions and shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger script that automates mouse actions.",
