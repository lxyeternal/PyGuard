{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for various AX (Accessibility) error codes, provides a factory to instantiate exceptions based on error codes, and includes a function to check error codes and raise appropriate exceptions.",
  "sources": "The function check_ax_error reads the error_code and error_messages parameters; error_code is an input, error_messages is a mapping provided externally.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the error_messages dictionary could be manipulated if untrusted, leading to misleading error messages or information leakage.",
  "flows": "error_code is checked against success; if not success, error_messages[error_code] is retrieved and used to raise an exception via AXErrorFactory.",
  "anomalies": "The only notable aspect is that error_messages is externally supplied, which could be manipulated, but this is standard in error handling routines.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a structured error handling mechanism for AX errors, with custom exceptions, a factory for exception creation, and a checker function. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The reliance on external error_messages is typical but could be exploited if untrusted, though this does not constitute malicious intent. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and safe. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is very low (~0.1-0.2) due to external input considerations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard error handling utility for AX error codes with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only minor concern is the external error_messages input, which is typical and not malicious. Overall, it poses no security threat.",
