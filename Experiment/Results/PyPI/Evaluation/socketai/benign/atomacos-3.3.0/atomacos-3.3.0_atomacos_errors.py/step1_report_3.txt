{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes for handling Accessibility (AX) error codes and provides functions to create error instances and check error codes, raising exceptions with messages accordingly.",
  "sources": "The code reads the error_code parameter in check_ax_error and error_messages dictionary for error messages.",
  "sinks": "Raising exceptions with error messages derived from error_messages or default messages.",
  "flows": "The function check_ax_error takes error_code and error_messages as input, then may raise an exception based on error_code and associated message.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code uses standard exception raising and straightforward error handling. No obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, or unusual constructs. No external data input is shown here.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a structured way to handle specific AX (Accessibility) error codes by defining custom exception classes for each error type, and a factory function to instantiate exceptions based on error codes. The check_ax_error function checks if an error code indicates success or failure; if failure, it retrieves or defaults an error message and raises the appropriate exception. The error handling is explicit and standard, with no signs of malicious behavior or hidden code. There are no suspicious external calls, data leaks, or unintended behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured error handling module for AX error codes. There is no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks within this code segment. It serves as a utility to handle and report accessibility-related errors securely and transparently.",
