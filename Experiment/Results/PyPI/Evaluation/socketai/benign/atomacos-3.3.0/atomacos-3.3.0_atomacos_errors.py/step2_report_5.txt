  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's logic, potential security implications, and scoring appropriateness.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes, a factory function, and an error checking function for AX error codes.\n- No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The only potential security concern is that the `error_messages` parameter is externally supplied, which could lead to information leakage if misused. However, this is typical in error handling and not inherently malicious.\n- There are no signs of backdoors, network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** Confirms the code is standard error handling with no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (due to external error_messages, but minimal)\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The score seems reasonable given the context.\n\n**Recommendation:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, notes that error_messages could lead to information disclosure but is not malicious.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior. The risk score is appropriate.\n\n**Recommendation:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the straightforward nature of the code, no malicious intent.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is benign.\n\n**Recommendation:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, emphasizing the lack of malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (very low)\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n**Recommendation:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Confirms the code is a standard utility with minimal security concerns.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Recommendation:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis & Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign a 0, as there is no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, consistent across reports.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (~0.1-0.2), justified by external input in error messages, but this is typical and not malicious.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (minor risk due to external error message input, but not malicious)\n\n---\n\n**Final conclusion:** The reports are accurate and well-justified. The code is a standard, benign error handling utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The scoring aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- No modifications needed.  \n- The code is safe and does not pose a supply chain security threat.",
