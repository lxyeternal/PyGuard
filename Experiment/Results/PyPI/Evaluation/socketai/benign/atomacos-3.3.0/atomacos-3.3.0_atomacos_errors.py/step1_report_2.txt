{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes for handling accessibility (AX) errors and provides a factory and checker function for these error codes.",
  "sources": "The code reads from imported constants representing error codes and from the input parameters 'error_code' and 'error_messages' in the function 'check_ax_error'.",
  "sinks": "The code raises exceptions with error messages based on the error code, potentially exposing internal error details if error_messages are externally controlled.",
  "flows": "The 'check_ax_error' function maps error codes to error messages and raises exceptions accordingly, with the message potentially derived from external input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or obfuscated logic. The code does not perform any network operations, file manipulations, or system commands. The only notable behavior is raising exceptions with messages that could originate from outside sources.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining a hierarchy of custom exception classes related to accessibility errors, an error factory, and a function to check error codes and raise exceptions with appropriate messages. The error messages are supplied via a parameter 'error_messages', which could be externally controlled, potentially leading to information disclosure if used improperly. The code does not contain any malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system modification, or network activity. It appears to be a utility for error handling within a larger application, with no evidence of sabotage or malware. Its primary concern is managing error states based on accessibility API error codes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard error handling utility for accessibility errors. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The potential concern is that error messages may be externally supplied, which could lead to information leakage if misused, but this is typical for such error handling code. Overall, the code is benign and functional.",
