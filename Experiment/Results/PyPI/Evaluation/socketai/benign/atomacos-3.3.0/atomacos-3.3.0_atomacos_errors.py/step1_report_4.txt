{
  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions and error handling functions for AX (Accessibility) errors in macOS, providing a structured way to handle different error codes.",
  "sources": "Error codes received as input to the function check_ax_error, error_messages mapping, imported constants representing error codes.",
  "sinks": "Error messages used in exceptions, potential logging or display of error messages, raising exceptions based on error codes.",
  "flows": "Error code received → check_ax_error function → error_message determined → exception raised if not success.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious dynamic code, no obfuscated code. No unusual or malicious logic; code is straightforward error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of AXError exception classes and a factory function to instantiate specific exception types based on error codes. The check_ax_error function validates error codes, raises exceptions with messages based on provided mappings, and handles unknown codes gracefully. The implementation appears standard for structured error handling, with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. It does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration. It simply manages error codes and exceptions related to accessibility APIs.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a clean, straightforward error handling module for AX errors, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It does not perform any harmful actions, and its purpose is to facilitate error management within a larger application.",
