  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's behavior, potential security implications, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Defines custom exception classes for various AX (Accessibility) error codes.\n- Implements a factory function `AXErrorFactory` to instantiate exception classes based on error codes.\n- Implements `check_ax_error` to evaluate an error code, retrieve an error message, and raise the corresponding exception if not successful.\n- The `error_messages` parameter is external and may contain untrusted input.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of each report:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Accurate description of exception classes, factory, and error checking.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, straightforward exception handling.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 (low, primarily because `error_messages` could be untrusted, but this is typical).\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard error handling code.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's assessment aligns with the code's behavior. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, correctly describes the code.\n- **Analysis:** Notes that `error_messages` could be externally controlled, which might lead to information disclosure, but no malicious intent.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard utility.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No malicious or suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Correctly describes the code.\n- **Analysis:** Emphasizes that the code is straightforward, with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, utility for error handling.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Similar description.\n- **Analysis:** Reiterates the straightforward nature, no malicious activity.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (minimal, mainly because external `error_messages` could be manipulated).\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Consistent with the previous reports.\n- **Analysis:** Recognizes the potential concern that `error_messages` could be externally supplied, but this is typical and not malicious.\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Code presence:** The code is present and functions as described.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, primarily related to external `error_messages`, which is typical in error handling routines.\n- **Scores:** All reports appropriately assign malware scores of 0, and security risks are low.\n\n---\n\n### **Final expert evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** Given the minimal security concern related to external input, a score of around 0.1–0.2 is appropriate, but not higher.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a standard, well-structured error handling utility for AX error codes. No malicious or suspicious activity is present. The only minor concern is the use of external `error_messages`, which could be manipulated but is typical in such error handling contexts.\n\n**Recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (reflecting minimal potential for information disclosure if `error_messages` is untrusted)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments and the code's actual behavior.",
