{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for AXError codes, map error codes to exceptions, and handle error checking for accessibility errors.",
  "sources": "The code reads input via the function parameter 'error_code' and 'error_messages', which are likely external inputs in real use cases.",
  "sinks": "The code raises exceptions based on error codes, which can lead to program flow interruption but do not directly cause harm.",
  "flows": "Input error_code is mapped through AXErrorFactory or error_messages to determine whether to raise an exception; exceptions are thrown based on error code.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a straightforward error handling utility with no suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a series of custom exception classes for various AXError codes, a factory function to map error codes to these exceptions, and a function 'check_ax_error' that raises exceptions based on error codes and messages. It operates purely within error handling logic. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious behavior is present. The code’s purpose is to facilitate error handling and exception raising based on accessibility API error codes. The structure is standard, with no obfuscation, suspicious network activity, or data leaks.\n\nPotential concerns are minimal, primarily related to how 'error_messages' is supplied externally, which could be manipulated. However, this is typical for error handling functions and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard error handling utility for accessibility API errors. It does not contain malicious behavior, sabotage, or suspicious activity. It is well-structured and serves its purpose without security risks.",
