  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes, a factory function, and an error-checking function.\n   - No reports mention or identify any obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n   - The code does not contain hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or any suspicious logic.\n\n2. **Error Handling and External Inputs:**\n   - The only potential concern is that `error_messages` is supplied externally to `check_ax_error`. If this input is untrusted, it could lead to information leakage or misleading error messages.\n   - However, this is a common pattern in error handling and does not imply malicious intent.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** Slight variation, but generally low (0.1 to 0.2). This is reasonable since the only minor concern relates to externally supplied error messages, which is a typical pattern and not inherently dangerous.\n\n4. **Potential Flaws or Misjudgments:**\n   - The reports seem consistent and reasonable in their assessments.\n   - No report overstates the risk or assigns high scores where unwarranted.\n   - The reasoning aligns with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious features.\n\n5. **Overall Security Assessment:**\n   - The code is a benign utility for error handling.\n   - No evidence of malicious activity, supply chain sabotage, or backdoors.\n   - The only minor concern relates to the external `error_messages` input, which is a standard pattern and not inherently risky.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate.\n- The malware score should remain at 0.\n- The obfuscated score should stay at 0.\n- The overall security risk should remain low, around 0.1 to 0.2, considering the external input caveat.\n\n**My Overall Estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** ~0.1 (since the only concern is external message input, which is typical and not malicious)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, well-structured error handling module for AX errors with no malicious intent or behavior. The assessments in the reports are accurate and justified.",
