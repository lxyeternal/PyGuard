  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, logic, and scores.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a simple import statement from the pyautogui library, providing access to keyboard automation functions.\n- No functions are invoked, no data is processed, and no malicious payloads are present within this snippet.\n- The presence of comments and the import statement alone does not indicate malicious intent.\n- The potential security concern arises if these functions are invoked with untrusted input elsewhere, but this cannot be assessed from the snippet alone.\n\n---\n\n### Report-by-Report Review:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; imports keyboard functions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No execution or data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** The flake8 ignore suggests minimal code context.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Scores seem reasonable; minimal risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, with a higher confidence (1).\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; no issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Slightly different wording but similar in conclusion.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Slightly more cautious, noting potential misuse if functions are invoked with untrusted input.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable; the code itself is benign, but the functions could be misused in larger context.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Recognizes that functions could be called with untrusted input, thus a slightly higher security risk.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.7.\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable; the code is a simple import, but potential misuse in larger codebases warrants cautious scoring.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious code or behavior is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** Given the code's simplicity, scores are generally low, but some reports assign slightly higher scores considering potential misuse if functions are invoked with untrusted input elsewhere.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code snippet's content.\n- The slight variations in securityRisk reflect differing levels of caution, which are justified based on the context provided.\n- Since the code only imports functions and constants, **the malware score should remain 0** across all reports.\n- The obfuscated score should stay at 0 unless evidence of obfuscation appears.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity or payloads are present.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n\n**Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 — considering potential misuse if these functions are invoked with untrusted input elsewhere, but the snippet itself is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final conclusion:\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a benign import statement with no inherent security risks. The risk scores could be slightly lowered to 0.1 across the board, but the current scores are acceptable given potential misuse in larger contexts.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (depending on context)\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a more conservative or aggressive scoring approach.",
