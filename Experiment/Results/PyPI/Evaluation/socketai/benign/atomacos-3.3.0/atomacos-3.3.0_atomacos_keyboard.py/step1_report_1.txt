{
  "purpose": "The code provides an interface to simulate keyboard inputs using the pyautogui library, likely for automation or scripting purposes.",
  "sources": "The code imports functions and constants from the pyautogui library, which can generate keyboard events.",
  "sinks": "The imported functions (hotkey, keyDown, keyUp, press, typewrite) are sinks where generated keyboard events occur, but they do not process untrusted input directly in this snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no explicit data flows in the provided code snippet; it only imports functions and constants without invoking them or processing external input.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains an import statement with a flake8 directive to ignore unused import warning, which may suggest the code is part of a larger script or intentionally suppresses warnings. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The snippet solely imports functions and constants from pyautogui related to keyboard simulation. No input data, user input, or untrusted data sources are processed. There are no evident malicious behaviors, backdoors, or security risks. The use of pyautogui for automation is common and not inherently malicious. The suppression of flake8 warning indicates possible minimal code context or an attempt to suppress false positives.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement for keyboard automation functions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger script intended for automation tasks. No suspicious activity or malicious behavior is evident.",
