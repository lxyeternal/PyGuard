  "purpose": "Import keyboard automation functions from pyautogui for potential use in scripts.",
  "sources": "Import statement from pyautogui module, no data input or external sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows; no untrusted data processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; only import statements present.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a flake8 directive comment; no suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for pyautogui keyboard functions, with no execution, data processing, or external input handling. No malicious payloads, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The potential security concern is limited to the functions being invoked with untrusted input elsewhere, which cannot be assessed here. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, indicating no malicious intent. The obfuscated score is 0, reflecting straightforward code. The risk score is low (around 0.1), acknowledging possible misuse if functions are called with untrusted data in a larger context. Overall, the code is benign and does not pose security threats in its current form.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign import statement from pyautogui with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. No further action or adjustment is necessary.",
