  "purpose": "Provides an interface to simulate keyboard inputs using the pyautogui library",
  "sources": "Imports from the pyautogui library, specifically KEY_NAMES, hotkey, keyDown, keyUp, press, typewrite",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present in this code snippet; the imported functions could be used to send keystrokes",
  "flows": "N/A - no function calls or data flows are shown in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; only import statements and a comment",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement for keyboard automation functions from pyautogui, with a comment referencing the keyboard API. No executable code, data handling, or logic is present. The import itself does not pose a security risk. The comment does not contain sensitive info or anomalies. Since there are no functions, data flows, or runtime behavior demonstrated, the security concerns are minimal. No hardcoded secrets or malicious constructs are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet solely imports functions related to keyboard input simulation from pyautogui without executing any actions. There are no malicious behaviors or security risks evident. It is a standard import statement with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
