{
  "purpose": "The code provides access to keyboard automation functions from the pyautogui library.",
  "sources": "Imports from pyautogui: KEY_NAMES, hotkey, keyDown, keyUp, press, typewrite",
  "sinks": "Potentially any of the imported functions when used with untrusted input could be misused for unintended automation or input simulation.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data (e.g., external input) could be passed to hotkey, keyDown, keyUp, press, or typewrite, which could automate keystrokes without user consent.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated segments. The code simply imports functions without further logic.",
  "analysis": "This module is a straightforward import statement from pyautogui, providing access to keyboard automation functions. There is no logic, no data processing, and no malicious payloads present. The code could be used maliciously if these functions are invoked with untrusted input elsewhere, but as-is, it only exposes keyboard control functions. The presence of the noqa comment suggests awareness of unused imports, indicating this is part of a larger script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign on its own; it merely imports keyboard automation functions from pyautogui. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
