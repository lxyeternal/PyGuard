{
  "purpose": "The code provides an import interface to control keyboard actions using the pyautogui library, such as pressing keys or typing.",
  "sources": "Imports from pyautogui, which can receive external input through function calls at runtime.",
  "sinks": "Functions like hotkey, keyDown, keyUp, press, typewrite could execute arbitrary keyboard actions that may influence user input or automation.",
  "flows": "External code calls functions like hotkey, keyDown, keyUp, press, or typewrite, which perform keyboard actions that can be triggered based on untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "The code only contains an import statement with a comment disabling linting; no actual function calls or data processing are present. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are visible.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is a minimal snippet that imports keyboard control functions from pyautogui. There are no data sources or user inputs within this code. The functions imported are capable of executing keyboard actions, which could be misused if called with untrusted data in a larger context. There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior in this fragment. The code's simplicity and lack of execution logic mean there is no immediate risk or malicious behavior evident here.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a harmless import statement setup for keyboard automation using pyautogui. On its own, it does not contain malware or security risks. However, in a larger context where these functions are used with untrusted input, there could be potential for malicious activity. Based solely on this snippet, the security risk is low.",
