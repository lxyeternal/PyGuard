{
  "purpose": "This code provides an API for keyboard automation functions from the pyautogui library, allowing simulated key presses and hotkeys.",
  "sources": "Imports from the pyautogui library, specifically KEY_NAMES, hotkey, keyDown, keyUp, press, typewrite",
  "sinks": "None directly present; the imported functions can simulate keyboard input which could potentially be misused if exploited elsewhere",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this code is a simple import statement and a comment, with no execution flow or data processing",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior; the code only imports modules and comments",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions and variables related to keyboard automation from pyautogui. It is a minimal, benign snippet that appears to serve as a utility or API wrapper. There are no data inputs, no execution of functions, and no suspicious constructs. The comment references a keyboard API, but does not perform any actions. The import statement itself is safe and common in automation scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import of pyautogui keyboard functions with no malicious intent or security risks. It is a straightforward setup for keyboard automation without any malicious behavior.",
