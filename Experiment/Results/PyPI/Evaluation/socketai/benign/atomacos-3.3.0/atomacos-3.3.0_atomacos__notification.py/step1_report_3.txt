{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up an observer for macOS UI elements to detect notifications, wait for specific events, and handle them asynchronously within a run loop.",
  "sources": "Reads include 'uielement' in __init__, 'notification', 'filter_' in wait_for, and system signals like SIGINT.",
  "sinks": "Uses system signal handling and run loop manipulation; potential for misuse if signals are hijacked, but no direct dangerous sink such as data exfiltration or command execution.",
  "flows": "Initializes observer -> adds notification -> adds run loop source -> waits in thread -> handles signals -> stops event loop -> removes notification.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behavior. Uses standard macOS system APIs and threading; no obfuscated code or malicious system calls observed.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a notification observer with a callback, integrates with macOS run loop, handles signals, and performs asynchronous waiting. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are evident. It leverages standard APIs for UI event handling and threading, with no hidden or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate macOS UI notification observer implementation. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware. It is a typical pattern for UI event listening with proper thread and signal handling. No security risks or malicious intent are identified.",
