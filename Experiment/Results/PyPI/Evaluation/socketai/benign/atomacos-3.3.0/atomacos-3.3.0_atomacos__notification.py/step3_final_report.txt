{
  "purpose": "This code implements a macOS notification observer using system APIs, setting up callbacks, run loop integration, signal handling, and threading for timeout management.",
  "sources": "Reads notification events via PAXObserverCreate, callback functions, and system signals.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communications; primarily manages internal event callbacks and system signals.",
  "flows": "Source: Notification callback triggers; Sink: Stores notification data in callback_result; Flow: Callback → callback_result → main thread timeout check → cleanup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; standard API usage and threading.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a notification observer, registers a callback, adds the observer's run loop source to the current run loop, and manages timeout via threading. It handles SIGINT signals to allow interruption and cleans up by removing notifications. No malicious activity such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors is present. The code uses standard macOS APIs appropriately, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The signal handling and threading are correctly implemented for a typical notification monitoring tool. The low security risk score (0.2) is justified given the code's purpose and behavior, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate macOS notification observer with proper event loop and signal management. It does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score of 0.2 are consistent and appropriate. Overall, the code is benign and poses no security threat.",
