      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured API wrapper for macOS accessibility functions. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present. The minimal security risk stems from the callback mechanism, which is standard but could be exploited if malicious callbacks are supplied externally. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for its intended purpose."
