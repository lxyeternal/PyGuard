{
  "purpose": "This module retrieves a list of files matching a specific format from given directory paths, supporting both single and multiple paths.",
  "sources": "Input: 'path' parameter (string or list of strings), and 'file_format' parameter. Data is read from the filesystem via fsspec's url_to_fs and glob functions.",
  "sinks": "File system operations such as globbing for files; no direct untrusted data sinks are evident beyond standard filesystem access.",
  "flows": "Input 'path' (source) is converted to absolute or filesystem-specific path, then glob pattern matching retrieves file paths (sink). No external data is fed into the code beyond initial parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors are detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated logic. The use of fsspec is standard for filesystem abstraction.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to list files matching a pattern, supporting multiple paths with consistency checks. It uses fsspec for filesystem operations and ensures sorting of file lists. The path handling includes converting to absolute paths and filesystem-specific URLs. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or security issues. The code operates purely to list files and does not process untrusted data in a harmful manner.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility for file listing with no malicious intent. It employs proper filesystem handling and does not contain suspicious or malicious code segments. It poses no security threat.",
