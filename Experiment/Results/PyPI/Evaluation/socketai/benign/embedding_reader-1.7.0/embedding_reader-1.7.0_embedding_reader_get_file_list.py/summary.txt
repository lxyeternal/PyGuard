  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for listing files matching a pattern across local and remote filesystems. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The assigned malware score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), consistent with its functionality. The reports' assessments are accurate and justified."
