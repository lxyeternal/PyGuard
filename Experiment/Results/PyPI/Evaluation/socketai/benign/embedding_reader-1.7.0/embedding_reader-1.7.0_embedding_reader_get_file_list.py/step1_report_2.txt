{
  "purpose": "The module retrieves a list of files matching a specified format from given directory paths, handling both single and multiple paths.",
  "sources": "The code reads input paths from function parameters `path`, and reads file system information using `fsspec.core.url_to_fs` and `fs.glob`.",
  "sinks": "The code generates file lists using `fs.glob` and returns absolute or relative paths. It does not write or transmit data, nor does it execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Input paths are converted to absolute paths, then used to obtain a filesystem object and list matching files via glob patterns. The results are combined and sorted before returning.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures are present. Use of `fsspec` is standard for filesystem abstraction. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code safely handles path inputs, converting URLs to filesystem objects and generating file lists using glob patterns. The use of `fsspec` and `os.path` is appropriate for filesystem interactions. No malicious behaviors, such as network exfiltration or data theft, are evident. The code does not execute external commands or evaluate untrusted code dynamically. The logic is straightforward and consistent with common file retrieval functions. No anomalies like hardcoded secrets or hidden backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, secure implementation for retrieving file lists from local or remote filesystems. No signs of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage are detected.",
