{
  "purpose": "The code retrieves a list of files matching a specific format from given directory paths, supporting both single and multiple paths.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters `path` and `file_format`. It also interacts with the filesystem through `fsspec.core.url_to_fs` and `fs.glob`.",
  "sinks": "The code generates file paths and interacts with the filesystem; potential sinks could include subsequent use of these paths in untrusted contexts or further processing.",
  "flows": "Input `path` is converted to absolute paths, then filesystem objects are obtained via `fsspec`. The `glob` method retrieves matching files, which are then combined with prefixes and sorted.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. Usage of `fsspec` is standard for file system abstraction. No obfuscated code or hidden malicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a straightforward utility for listing files matching a pattern, with proper handling for multiple paths and filesystem types. The use of `fsspec` and `os` modules is appropriate and standard. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors. The logic is transparent and safe for typical file handling scenarios.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard file listing utility with no malicious intent. It does not perform any suspicious or malicious actions, and its functionality is limited to safe filesystem interactions.",
