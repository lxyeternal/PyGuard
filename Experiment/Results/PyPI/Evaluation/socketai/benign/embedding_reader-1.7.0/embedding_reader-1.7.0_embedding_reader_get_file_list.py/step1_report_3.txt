{
  "purpose": "Retrieve file lists from specified paths, supporting both single and multiple paths, and handle path resolution.",
  "sources": "User inputs the `path` parameter (string or list of strings); filesystem operations via fsspec (url_to_fs, glob).",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or transmits data directly; uses filesystem globbing and path resolution functions.",
  "flows": "Input `path` (source) passes through path checks and is used to generate glob patterns (sink). Filesystem functions process paths, returning file lists.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Use of fsspec and path globbing appears standard. No obfuscated code or malicious intent evident. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leakage observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily focuses on filesystem interaction: resolving paths, comparing filesystem types, globbing for files matching a format, and sorting results. The functions use well-known libraries (fsspec, os) and standard path handling techniques. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, command injection, or hidden backdoors. The path handling and filesystem interactions appear straightforward. No suspicious or malicious signals detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for file listing based on path inputs and file format filtering. It appears safe and free from malicious intent or security risks. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors identified.",
