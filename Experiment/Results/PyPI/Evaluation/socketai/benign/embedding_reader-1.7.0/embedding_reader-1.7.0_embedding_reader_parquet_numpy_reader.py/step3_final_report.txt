  "sources": [
    "File system reads for numpy and parquet files",
    "Header extraction via get_numpy_headers",
    "File slices and table reads from pyarrow.parquet"

  "sinks": [
    "Numpy arrays containing embeddings",
    "Pandas DataFrames with metadata"
  ],
  "flows": [
    "Headers read from files -> batch construction -> file slicing -> numpy buffer reading -> pandas DataFrame creation"
  ],
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard data loading techniques with parallel processing, retries on parquet read failures, and broad exception handling for robustness. No malicious code, sabotage, or obfuscation is evident. Use of threading and semaphores aligns with high-performance data ingestion. Exception handling is broad but typical for I/O operations. No external network communication or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured data loader for numpy and parquet files, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
