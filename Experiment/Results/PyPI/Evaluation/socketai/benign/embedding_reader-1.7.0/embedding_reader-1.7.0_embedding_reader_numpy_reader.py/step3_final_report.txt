{
  "purpose": "Reads numpy embedding files, parses headers, and loads data in parallel for streaming processing.",
  "sources": "File headers, file content during read_piece function",
  "sinks": "Data returned as numpy arrays; no untrusted data sinks or network activity",
  "flows": "Header parsing -> file reading in parallel -> data concatenation into batches",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard numpy file header parsing, parallel reading with threading and semaphores, and batch assembly. It does not include network activity, code injection, or obfuscation. No signs of malicious intent or sabotage are present. External risks depend on input file trustworthiness, not the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured numpy embedding reader with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attack vectors. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 are appropriate.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
