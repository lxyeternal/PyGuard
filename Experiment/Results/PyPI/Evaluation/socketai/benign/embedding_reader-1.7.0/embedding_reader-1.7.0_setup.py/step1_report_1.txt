  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python project named 'embedding_reader' with dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' and 'requirements.txt' files; no untrusted input sources; static data only.",
  "sinks": "None that process untrusted data directly; setup() function handles package installation parameters.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external untrusted sources to critical sinks; only file reads and package setup functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors observed. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup operations: reading files for description and requirements, configuring package metadata, and invoking setuptools.setup(). No malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behavior detected. No network activity, no code injection, and no handling of untrusted input beyond reading known files.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a typical package configuration file with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It securely reads static files and supplies necessary package information without processing untrusted input or executing suspicious actions.",
