{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing a Python project named 'embedding_reader'.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description, reading dependencies from 'requirements.txt'.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data is written to external systems or network communications.",
  "flows": "Input files ('README.md' and 'requirements.txt') are read and processed into variables for setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors. No code injection or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script reads 'README.md' content to set as the long description. It defines a helper function '_read_reqs' to load dependencies from 'requirements.txt', filtering out comments and blank lines. These inputs are used in the 'setup' function to configure package metadata, dependencies, and other package info. All file operations are straightforward and standard for Python packaging, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. The code does not perform any network activity, data leakage, or system modifications. No anomalies, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It safely reads input files and configures package metadata without any suspicious behavior.",
