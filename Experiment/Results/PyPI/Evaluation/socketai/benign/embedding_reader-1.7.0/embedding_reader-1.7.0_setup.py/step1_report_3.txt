{
  "purpose": "This code is for setting up a Python package named 'embedding_reader' including reading dependencies and metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads 'requirements.txt' for dependencies, reads 'README.md' for long description, and accesses package files for inclusion.",
  "targets": "No direct untrusted data sinks; setup process uses static files and package metadata, no data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions or outputs; the code mainly loads static files and configures package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected; the code follows standard setup.py structure.",
  "analysis": "The script reads static files for description and dependencies, then calls 'setup()' with metadata and requirements. No dynamic code execution, no network activity, no input validation or injection points are present. The code uses common practices for packaging Python projects, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script for packaging a Python project with no malicious intent or security risks. It handles package metadata and dependencies safely without suspicious or malicious activity.",
