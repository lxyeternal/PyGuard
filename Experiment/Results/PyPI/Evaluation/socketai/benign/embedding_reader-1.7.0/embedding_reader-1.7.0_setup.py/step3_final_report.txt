  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging a project, reading static files for metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' and 'requirements.txt' files from local filesystem.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or external data processing.",
  "flows": "Reading static files into variables, then passing data to setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and follows common packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The code reads static files ('README.md' and 'requirements.txt') and invokes setuptools.setup() with project metadata. It does not perform any dynamic code execution, network activity, or handle untrusted input. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors. The code structure is standard for a setup.py script, and all operations are safe and predictable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard packaging script with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
