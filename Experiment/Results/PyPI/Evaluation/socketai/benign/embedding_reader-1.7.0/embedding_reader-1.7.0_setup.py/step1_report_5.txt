{
  "purpose": "The script is used for setting up a Python package called 'embedding_reader' by reading package metadata and dependencies, and configuring the package installation process.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md file for long description, reads requirements.txt for dependencies, and gathers package information for setup()",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data output or external system calls that could be exploited",
  "flows": "Reads local files (README.md, requirements.txt), processes data, and passes it to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard setup.py structure, no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup procedures for a Python package, including reading local documentation and dependencies, and invoking setuptools.setup(). All file reads are local, with no external inputs or network calls. No suspicious behavior or malicious logic detected, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The code is straightforward and adheres typical packaging conventions.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a normal setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
