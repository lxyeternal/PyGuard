  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Report 1**:\n   - **Issue presence**: The code is just an import statement; no issues are present.\n   - **Errors or flaws**: None identified.\n   - **Scores**: Malware and security risk are both 0, which is appropriate.\n   - **Justification**: The code is benign, with no suspicious activity.\n   - **Conclusion**: Scores seem reasonable.\n\n2. **Report 2**:\n   - **Issue presence**: Again, just an import statement; no issues.\n   - **Errors or flaws**: None.\n   - **Scores**: Malware is 0, security risk is 0.1. The small security risk score (0.1) suggests minimal concern, perhaps due to the module's origin or context, but since the code is only an import, this seems slightly overstated.\n   - **Justification**: No malicious behavior detected; the minor risk could be a conservative estimate.\n   - **Recommendation**: Consider lowering the securityRisk score to 0, as no actual risk is demonstrated in the snippet.\n\n3. **Report 3**:\n   - **Issue presence**: No issues; straightforward import.\n   - **Scores**: Malware and security risk are both 0, which is appropriate.\n   - **Conclusion**: Scores are reasonable.\n\n4. **Report 4**:\n   - **Issue presence**: No issues; just an import.\n   - **Scores**: Malware and security risk both 0, appropriate.\n   - **Conclusion**: Correct scoring.\n\n5. **Report 5**:\n   - **Issue presence**: No issues; simple import.\n   - **Scores**: Malware 0, security risk 0, which aligns with the code.\n   - **Conclusion**: Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of observations:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is just an import statement with no malicious activity.\n- The only minor concern is Report 2's securityRisk score of 0.1, which may be slightly overstated given the simplicity of the code snippet.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score**: 0 for all, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 for all, as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score**: 0 for all, since the code is benign.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence: simple import statements with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
