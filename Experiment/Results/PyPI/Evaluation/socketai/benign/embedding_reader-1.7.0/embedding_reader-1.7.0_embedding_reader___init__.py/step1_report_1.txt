There are no suspicious operations, no embedded code, no hardcoded secrets, and no signs of malicious behavior. Since it is only an import statement, it does not perform any actions or contain malicious logic by itself.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a straightforward import statement with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is standard practice in Python projects.",
