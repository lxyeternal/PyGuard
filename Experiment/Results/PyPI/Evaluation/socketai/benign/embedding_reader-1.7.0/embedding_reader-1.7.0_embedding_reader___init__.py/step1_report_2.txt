  "purpose": "Importing the EmbeddingReader class from the embedding_reader.embedding_reader module.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing from a third-party or internal package/module.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no data processing or output functions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow observed; only a class import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only an import statement with no additional logic. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class named EmbeddingReader from a module with the same name. It is a straightforward import statement with no embedded or executable code, no user input, or external data sources. Since no further code is present, there are no apparent security issues, malicious behaviors, or obfuscated code. The simplicity suggests it's part of a larger codebase where EmbeddingReader may be used.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks detected in this snippet. It appears benign.",
