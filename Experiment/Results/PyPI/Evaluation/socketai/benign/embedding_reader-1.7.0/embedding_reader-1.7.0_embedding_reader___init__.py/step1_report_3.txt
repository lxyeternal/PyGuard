  "purpose": "Import the EmbeddingReader class from the embedding_reader.embedding_reader module, likely for reading or processing embeddings.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing EmbeddingReader class from a local or package module.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling observed in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this code only contains an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement, which imports a class from a module named embedding_reader. There are no input sources, data flows, or data sinks present. No obfuscated or malicious code is present. The purpose appears to be setting up for using the EmbeddingReader class in further code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears benign and standard for Python projects.",
