{
  "purpose": "Importing the EmbeddingReader class from the embedding_reader.embedding_reader module, likely for use in embedding data processing or reading.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself reads the module 'embedding_reader.embedding_reader' to load the EmbeddingReader class.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows involving untrusted input or output operations in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; this is a single import statement without execution of untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard, with no unusual language features, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "This code solely performs a standard import of a class from a module named 'embedding_reader'. There are no data manipulations, network operations, or code execution beyond import. The module name and class do not indicate any malicious activity. The import appears to be straightforward and typical for a Python project.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no signs of malicious intent, no anomalous behavior, and no security risks detected.",
