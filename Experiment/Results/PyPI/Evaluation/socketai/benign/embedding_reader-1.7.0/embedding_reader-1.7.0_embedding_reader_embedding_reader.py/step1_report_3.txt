{
  "purpose": "Provides an interface to read embedding data from various file formats (npy, parquet, parquet_npy) and produce embedding batches.",
  "sources": "embeddings_folder parameter and file format selection in __init__, possibly external input when instantiated",
  "sinks": "The code calls other classes (NumpyReader, ParquetReader, ParquetNumpyReader) which may process or load data, but no direct sinks such as network, file write, or system commands are present",
  "flows": "Input parameters (embeddings_folder, file_format, meta_columns, etc.) flow into class instantiation, then into the reader object, which is invoked in __call__ to produce data batches",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, secrets, or backdoors are evident. No use of unsafe code or obfuscated logic. The code mainly delegates reading to other classes; these classes are assumed to be standard data readers.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a wrapper class for reading embedding data in different formats. It validates the file_format parameter and instantiates appropriate reader classes. These reader classes are external and could potentially contain malicious behavior, but this cannot be determined from this snippet. The __call__ method forwards parameters to the reader instance, facilitating batch retrieval. No suspicious or malicious code, network activity, or data leakage mechanisms are present within this snippet. The code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured interface with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a data loader interface without any embedded malicious behavior or supply chain attack vectors within this snippet. It relies on external reader classes whose security depends on their implementation. No malware signals or security risks are evident in this code fragment.",
