{
  "purpose": "Provides a unified interface for reading embedding data from different file formats (Numpy, Parquet, Parquet-Numpy).",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'embeddings_folder', 'file_format', 'metadata_folder', 'start', 'end', 'batch_size', 'max_piece_size', 'parallel_pieces', 'show_progress', 'max_ram_usage_in_bytes'.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no untrusted data is written or transmitted outside the local environment.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (sources) are passed to the reader instance, which reads data from specified files based on format. The call method passes control to the reader's reading functions, which access the filesystem.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. No network activity, code injection, or environment variable misuse observed.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a reader object based on the provided file format, passing folder paths and column parameters. It exposes a callable interface that delegates data reading to the reader. No user input is directly executed, and file access appears limited to local filesystem reading. No obfuscation or hidden code is present. External library calls are straightforward and do not involve dynamic code execution or malicious behavior. The code relies on the security of underlying reader classes (NumpyReader, ParquetReader, ParquetNumpyReader), which are not provided here but appear to be standard data loaders.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a safe interface for reading embedding data from files. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this snippet. The security posture depends on the correctness and safety of the underlying reader implementations, but based on this code alone, there are no malicious indicators.",
