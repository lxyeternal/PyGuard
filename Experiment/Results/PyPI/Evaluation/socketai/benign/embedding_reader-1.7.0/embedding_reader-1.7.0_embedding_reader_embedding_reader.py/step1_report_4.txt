{
  "purpose": "This module provides an interface for reading embeddings data from various file formats (Numpy, Parquet, Parquet Numpy) to produce embedding batches.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as embeddings_folder, file_format, embedding_column, meta_columns, metadata_folder, and method parameters in __call__.",
  "sinks": "Data is passed to underlying reader classes; no direct sink for untrusted data is visible here.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to instantiate specific reader classes; the __call__ method forwards parameters to the reader's __call__, processing data batches.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior observed. No network calls, data leaks, or system modifications are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes different reader classes based on the file_format parameter, handling input directories and column names. The __call__ method delegates batch processing to these readers, passing parameters without modification. There are no suspicious or malicious code patterns, such as network access, system modifications, or data exfiltration. The code appears to be a straightforward data reader interface, relying on external classes for actual reading logic. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware-like activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a simple interface to various embedding data readers without any suspicious behavior or malicious intent. It securely delegates data reading tasks to underlying classes with no signs of malware or security risks.",
