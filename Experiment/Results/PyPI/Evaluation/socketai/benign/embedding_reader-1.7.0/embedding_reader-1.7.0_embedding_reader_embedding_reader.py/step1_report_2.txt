{
  "purpose": "Provides a unified interface to read embedding data from various file formats (npy, parquet, parquet_npy).",
  "sources": "embeddings_folder input parameter used to specify data location; meta_columns, metadata_folder, and other parameters used for configuration.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data is written, transmitted, or leaked.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (embeddings_folder, meta_columns) flow into reader constructors; no external data flow observed beyond initialization and method calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments. No use of dynamic code execution, obfuscated constructs, or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a reader object based on the specified format, passing configuration parameters. It exposes a callable interface to fetch data batches from the reader. No external network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious logic present. It primarily serves as a wrapper around existing reader classes, with standard exception handling for invalid formats.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign wrapper for reading embedding data from various file formats. No signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware are detected. The design is straightforward and aligns with typical data loading patterns.",
