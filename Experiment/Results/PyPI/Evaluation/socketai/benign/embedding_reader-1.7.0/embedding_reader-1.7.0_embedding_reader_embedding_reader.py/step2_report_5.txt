  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their assessments with the code, and then synthesize an overall security stance.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is a wrapper that initializes specific reader classes based on the file format and delegates data reading via the `__call__` method.\n- No user input is directly executed as code; parameters are passed to external classes.\n- The code does not perform network activity, data exfiltration, or environment variable misuse.\n- The underlying reader classes (`NumpyReader`, `ParquetReader`, `ParquetNumpyReader`) are external and not provided, so their security depends on their implementation.\n- No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code appears to be a straightforward, standard data loader interface.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n\n- **Presence of issues in code:**  \n  No issues are detected in this code snippet itself. It appears well-structured, with proper parameter validation for `file_format`.  \n  **Note:** Security concerns could arise if the underlying reader classes are malicious, but from this snippet alone, no such issues are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n\n- **Logical or security flaws:**  \n  None apparent within this code.  \n- **Potential improvements:**  \n  It might be beneficial to validate `embeddings_folder` and other parameters for path traversal or invalid inputs, but this is outside the scope of the current review.\n\n---\n\n### Scores review:\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|-----------|--------------|--------|\n| 1       | 0         | 0            | 0.1    |\n| 2       | 0         | 0            | 0.1    |\n| 3       | 0         | 0            | 0.2    |\n| 4       | 0         | 0            | 0.1    |\n| 5       | 0         | 0            | 0      |\n\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly higher for some reports (up to 0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risk in relying on external classes and filesystem access. These seem reasonable.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nThe risk scores are reasonable; they reflect the minimal inherent risk in this wrapper code. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n\n- None of the current scores exceed 0.5, so no justification needed for higher scores.\n- If a future report claimed malicious behavior in the underlying reader classes, then the risk score should be increased accordingly.\n\n---\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:\n\n- The reports assume the underlying reader classes are safe. If these classes are malicious, then the overall system could be compromised.\n- The code relies on the correctness and security of external libraries, which is a common dependency risk.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency and critical review:\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a benign wrapper.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected.\n- The security posture depends on the external classes, but from this code alone, no issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, inherent in filesystem access and external dependencies)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is a straightforward, well-structured interface for reading embedding data from various formats. It does not contain malicious code, obfuscation, or security flaws within itself. The security of the overall system depends on the integrity of the external reader classes, but from this snippet alone, there are no indicators of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always review the implementation and security of external dependencies before deployment.",
