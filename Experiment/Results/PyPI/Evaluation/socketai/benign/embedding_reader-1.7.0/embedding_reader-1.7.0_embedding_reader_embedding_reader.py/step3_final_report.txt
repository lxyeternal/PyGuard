{
  "purpose": "Provides a unified interface to initialize and delegate reading of embedding data from various file formats (npy, parquet, parquet_npy).",
  "sources": "embeddings_folder, file_format, embedding_column, meta_columns, metadata_folder, start, end, max_piece_size, parallel_pieces, show_progress, max_ram_usage_in_bytes",
  "sinks": "Delegates to external reader classes; no direct data leaks or network activity observed",
  "flows": "Initialization parameters -> select and instantiate appropriate reader class -> call to self.reader with batch parameters",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual control flow detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward wrapper that initializes specific reader classes based on input parameters and delegates data reading tasks. It performs parameter validation for 'file_format' and assigns the reader object accordingly. No network, code injection, or environment variable manipulation is present. The external reader classes are not provided, so their security depends on their implementation, but the wrapper itself does not introduce malicious behavior. The code does not process untrusted data beyond local filesystem access, and no obfuscation or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured interface for reading embedding data. It does not contain malicious or obfuscated code, and the security risk is minimal, primarily dependent on the external reader classes. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and a low security risk score (~0.1) is justified.",
