  "purpose": "Provides an interface to read embedding data from various file formats for further processing or analysis.",
  "sources": "Embeddings folder input, file_format parameter, metadata_folder input, optional meta_columns list.",
  "sinks": "Data returned by self.reader, potentially large embedding data (not directly malicious), no direct sinks for untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (file paths, format options) are used to instantiate specific reader classes, which then produce embedding data when called.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated segments. No unusual or malicious code patterns detected. Usage of dynamic file format handling is standard. No network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a reader object based on the provided file format, which could be numpy or parquet files. It manages reading embedding data and metadata. The class encapsulates reader initialization and delegation of read calls. No code injection, unsafe SQL, or environment variable misuse is present. No signs of malicious behavior or backdoors. The code mainly handles file I/O and data processing, with no network or external command execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of an embedding data reader interface with no malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. It simply delegates to specialized reader classes based on user input. No security risks identified within this module.",
