{
  "purpose": "Read and stream embeddings from Parquet files stored in a specified folder, with support for batching, parallel reading, and progress monitoring.",
  "sources": "File system reads via fs.open() for each parquet file; reading metadata and batch data from parquet files.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no network connections, no data exfiltration, and no command execution are present.",
  "flows": "Input paths from get_file_list -> file_to_header reads metadata -> build_pieces defines data slices -> read_piece reads parquet data -> yields batches of embeddings and metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad exception handling (try/except Exception) which could mask errors but not malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious obfuscation. Use of multithreading is typical for performance but does not appear malicious. No code appears to execute untrusted code or perform unauthorized actions.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically reads parquet files, extracts embeddings and optional metadata, and streams data in batches. It employs thread pools and semaphores for parallelism and resource control. No suspicious network activity, credential handling, or backdoors are present. Exception handling is broad but does not indicate malicious intent. The code's purpose aligns with its implementation, and no malicious behavior or sabotage signals are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured data loader for embeddings stored in parquet files. No signs of malware or malicious behavior are present. The code focuses on performance and robustness without malicious intent.",
