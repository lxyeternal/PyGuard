{
  "purpose": "The code reads embeddings stored in Parquet files from a specified folder, providing batch processing with support for parallel reading and progress indication.",
  "sources": "File reads through 'fs.open' calls; reading Parquet files via 'pq.ParquetFile'; user-provided file paths for 'get_file_list'; input parameters such as batch size, start/end indices.",
  "sinks": "Data returned in batches (numpy arrays, pandas DataFrames); reading from potentially untrusted Parquet files; no explicit untrusted data sinks such as network connections or system modifications found.",
  "flows": "File open -> read table -> extract embeddings and metadata -> yield batches; no data flows into insecure sinks or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. Use of threading and file handling appears standard. No obfuscated code, misleading variables, or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file reading, metadata extraction, and batch processing for Parquet files containing embeddings. It employs threading for efficiency and manages open file resources responsibly. No signs of malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or sabotage mechanisms are evident. The code relies on open-source libraries for reading data, with no indications of hidden behavior. The process is focused solely on data extraction and batching for further processing, without involving network activity, system modification, or credential handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward and secure implementation of reading embedding data from Parquet files. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data flows. The code is well-structured for its purpose and does not contain obfuscated or malicious segments.",
