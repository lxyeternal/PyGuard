{
  "purpose": "The code provides a function to split large data files into smaller pieces for parallel processing, handling batching and file boundaries.",
  "sources": "Reads input from the 'headers' list, extracting filename, count, count_before, and optional metadata columns.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data leaks; no network transmission, file writing, or dynamic code execution occurs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input headers through iteration and boundary checks to output a structured DataFrame of pieces with metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of data batching, using standard Python and pandas. It correctly manages file offsets, batch ranges, and piece sizes, with proper boundary handling. No malicious or maliciously obfuscated behavior is present. The logic is transparent, and the function performs as intended without side effects or external interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard data batching utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and justified.",
