{
  "purpose": "The code constructs and returns data frame containing batch and piece information for processing multiple files in chunks.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the 'headers' argument, which is a dictionary of lists with file-related metadata.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; the code primarily processes and outputs data without executing untrusted code or system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'headers' into namedtuple instances, processed in loops, and finally into a pandas DataFrame.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. The logic is straightforward, handling batch splitting.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically creates batch pieces based on input headers and parameters, with no signs of malicious behavior. No dangerous system calls, network activity, or data leaks are evident. It performs data processing, primarily reading and splitting input data, without executing untrusted commands or external interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility for batching file processing, with no malicious intent or malicious behavior detected. It follows typical data processing patterns without suspicious anomalies.",
