  "purpose": "Collection of Flask utility functions for response handling, URL generation, environment variable configuration, session and request management, and file serving.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., FLASK_DEBUG, FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV), request context globals, session data, imported modules, and user input via URL parameters.",
  "sinks": "Response objects, URL endpoints, flashed message storage, file serving functions, and redirect responses.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence configuration; request data flows into URL generation and response functions; session data is manipulated during flash messaging; user input (e.g., URL parameters) may influence URL and file serving functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. Usage of standard Flask and Werkzeug APIs with typical data flows.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard Flask utility functions that interact with environment variables for configuration, manage request and session globals, generate responses, handle URL building, and serve files. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, or backdoors. The environment variables used are typical for configuration purposes. The code structure is clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs. The data flows are consistent with normal Flask application patterns, and no anomalies or secrets are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Flask utility module with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is correctly set to 0, obfuscation is absent, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1). The code does not pose any supply chain security threat.",
