  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes standard Flask utilities, environment variables, request/session globals, and function arguments.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Response objects, environment variables, session data, request globals. No suspicious data flows.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, or malicious code. Uses standard Flask and Werkzeug APIs.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, low security risk, no malware.\n\n**Score Justification:** The report correctly identifies the code as standard Flask utilities with no malicious behavior. The malware score of 0 and security risk of 0.1 are appropriate, given reliance on environment variables for configuration, which is typical.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing environment variables and request globals.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Response creation, URL generation, flashing, file serving.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious or malicious code detected; standard Flask practices.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, low malware risk.\n\n**Score Justification:** The malware score of 0 and security risk of 0.1 are consistent. No evidence of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, standard Flask utilities, environment variables, request/session data.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Response objects, URL building, flashing, file serving.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation; typical Flask code.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, low malware risk.\n\n**Score Justification:** Malware score 0 and security risk 0.2 are reasonable, considering the environment variable usage for configuration.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous reports, standard Flask utilities, environment variables.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Response creation, URL, file serving, flashing.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, no obfuscation, no secrets.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, low risk.\n\n**Score Justification:** Malware 0, security risk 0.1 are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard Flask utilities, environment variables, request/session data.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Response, URL, file serving, flashing.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious or malicious patterns; standard Flask practices.\n- **Conclusion:** Very low risk, no malware.\n\n**Score Justification:** Malware 0, security risk 0.1 are correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, which is accurate.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2), reflecting the standard configuration via environment variables but not indicating any real security threat.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (standard configuration, no evident vulnerabilities)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a typical Flask utility module, with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks beyond normal configuration considerations. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
