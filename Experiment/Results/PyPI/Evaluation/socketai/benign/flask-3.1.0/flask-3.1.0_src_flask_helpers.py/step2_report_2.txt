  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes standard Flask utility functions; sources are environment variables, request/session globals, and imported modules.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Response objects, environment variables, session data, URL generation, and request data are typical and expected.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious or malicious patterns detected; standard Flask practices.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a typical Flask utility module with no signs of malicious activity. The confidence is high (0.9), and the malware score is 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1; uses environment variables, request, session, and templates.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Standard Flask and Werkzeug APIs; no suspicious data flows.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or malicious code detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard Flask utility functions, no malicious behavior. Malware score remains 0.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, similar utility functions; environment variables, request context, session.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Typical Flask response and file serving; no anomalies.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns or malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Consistent with previous assessments; low risk, malware score 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard Flask utilities; environment variables, request, session.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Typical Flask response creation, URL building, file serving.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious code or suspicious data flows.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity; low security risk, malware score 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as others; environment variables, request, session.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Response, URL, file serving, flashing messages—all standard.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious or malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Very standard Flask utility code; no malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent detected.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** None; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Malware score:** Appropriately 0 for all reports, given the benign nature.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, consistent with standard Flask utilities.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (consistent with minimal configuration-based risks)\n- **Overall malware potential:** None\n- **Obfuscation:** None\n- **Security threat level:** Very low\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, well-implemented Flask utility module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code’s nature.",
