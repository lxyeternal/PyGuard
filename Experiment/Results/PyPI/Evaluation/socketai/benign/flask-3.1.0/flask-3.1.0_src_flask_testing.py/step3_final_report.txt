  "purpose": "Testing utilities for Flask applications, including environment builder, test client, and CLI runner.",
  "sources": "Configuration data, environment variables, request data, package version info, session management.",
  "sinks": "Request environment, session storage, response headers, JSON serialization.",
  "flows": "Data flows from configuration/environment into request objects, session handling, and response processing within testing contexts.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; code uses standard libraries and patterns without suspicious or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured set of testing utilities for Flask, involving environment setup, request simulation, session management, and CLI testing. It interacts only with configuration, environment, and request data, with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The version fetching is straightforward and safe. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present. The malware scores are correctly set to 0, and the low security risk scores (~0.1-0.2) are justified given the code's testing purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign testing utility suite for Flask applications. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
