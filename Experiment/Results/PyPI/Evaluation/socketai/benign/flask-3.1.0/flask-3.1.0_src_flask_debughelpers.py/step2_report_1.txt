  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's logic, potential security implications, and consistency of the scores.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code provides utility functions, custom exceptions, and request patching mainly for debugging and error reporting in a Flask-like web framework.\n- No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated patterns are evident.\n- The main \"suspicious\" aspect is the patching of `request.files.__class__`, which, while unconventional, is used here solely for debugging purposes.\n- The reports assign a malware score of 0 and a low security risk (~0.2), which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in code:\n- The code functions as intended for debugging/error handling.\n- No issues or vulnerabilities are confirmed based on the code snippets.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- The patching of `request.files.__class__` could potentially be misused if an attacker can influence the request object, but in a controlled debugging environment, this is acceptable.\n- No actual bugs or security flaws are identified.\n\n### Score review:\n- **Malware score:** consistently 0 across all reports, which is justified.\n- **Security risk:** low (~0.2), mainly due to the unconventional class patching, which could be risky if misused, but is intended for debugging.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, correctly indicating clear code.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.5, which is appropriate.\n- The only \"risky\" aspect (patching `__class__`) is for debugging and does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n### Potential assumptions and claims:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is for debugging/error reporting.\n- No false positives or assumptions about malicious behavior are present.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the code's purpose and analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is clear)  \n**Risk score:** 0.2 (low, due to unconventional class patching but intended for debugging)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the detailed analysis. The code is a standard debugging utility with no malicious intent.",
