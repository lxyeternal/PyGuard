  "purpose": "Utility functions, custom exceptions, and request patching mechanisms for debugging, error reporting, and template diagnostics within a Flask-like web framework.",
  "sources": "request.form, request.files, request.url, request.mimetype, loader objects, request context",
  "sinks": "Raising exceptions with detailed messages, modifying request.files.__class__, logging debug info",
  "flows": "Data from request inputs flows into exception messages, class modifications, and logs; class patching for debugging purposes",
  "anomalies": "Unconventional patching of request.files.__class__, but explicitly for debugging and error reporting",
  "analysis": "The code contains no malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated patterns. The class patching is a debugging utility, not malicious. No network activity or data exfiltration is present. The purpose is diagnostic and error handling, with no security vulnerabilities identified. The patching of request.files.__class__ is unconventional but documented as a debugging aid, posing minimal risk. The code is straightforward, with no suspicious behavior or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for debugging and error diagnostics in a web framework. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
