{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Flask framework module, responsible for importing various components and setting up attribute access.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules and standard library (importlib.metadata, warnings). The only data input is through attribute access (__getattr__).",
  "sinks": "The __getattr__ function can access importlib.metadata.version, which could potentially be exploited to trigger warnings or access version info, but not harmful behavior.",
  "flows": "Attribute access to '__version__' triggers import of version info; normal imports and attribute access otherwise do not involve untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __getattr__ for dynamic attribute handling is standard; no suspicious code, hidden backdoors, or malicious data leaks observed. No hardcoded credentials or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports various components of Flask from internal modules, setting up an attribute fallback for '__version__' that issues a deprecation warning and retrieves version info via importlib.metadata. The __getattr__ method is only used for version info and does not execute untrusted code or perform any network activity. No anomalies, malicious code, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Flask module setup with a deprecation warning for version attribute access. No malicious intent or security risks are detected. The use of __getattr__ is safe and standard.",
