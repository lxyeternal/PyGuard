{
  "purpose": "Module for a Flask-like framework, handling imports and providing a controlled deprecated '__version__' attribute via __getattr__.",
  "sources": "Access to the '__version__' attribute triggers importlib.metadata.version('flask') to retrieve package version.",
  "sinks": "The version retrieval acts as a sink, executing only upon attribute access, with no external data or untrusted input involved.",
  "flows": "Accessing '__version__' flows to importlib.metadata.version('flask'), returning version info after issuing a warning.",
  "anomalies": "None; standard pattern for deprecated attribute handling, no secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports internal modules and defines __getattr__ to handle '__version__'. When accessed, it issues a deprecation warning and retrieves the package version via importlib.metadata. No untrusted data, external network calls, or malicious logic are involved. The pattern is common and safe, with controlled dynamic attribute access. No anomalies or suspicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard module initializer for a Flask-like framework, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The deprecation warning and version retrieval are standard practices. All reports correctly assess this as benign, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1) reflecting the minimal inherent risk of controlled dynamic attribute handling.",
