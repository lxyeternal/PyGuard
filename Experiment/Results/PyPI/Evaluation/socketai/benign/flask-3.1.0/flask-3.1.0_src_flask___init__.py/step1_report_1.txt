{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module for a web framework, likely Flask, that imports various components and defines a dynamic attribute getter.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.app, .blueprints, .config, .ctx, .globals, .helpers, .json, .signals, .templating, .wrappers) and the dynamic attribute __getattr__ which retrieves package version info.",
  "sinks": "The __getattr__ function calls importlib.metadata.version(\"flask\") and issues a warning; potential for misuse if version info is exploited, but typical for package metadata.",
  "flows": "Access to '__version__' triggers __getattr__, which then performs a version fetch via importlib.metadata, possibly with a warning, but no data flow to external systems or side-effects beyond standard library behavior.",
  "anomalies": "The only dynamic behavior is retrieving package version info with a deprecation warning. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious logic are present. All imports are from internal modules or standard library.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up imports for a Flask-like framework, defining an __getattr__ method for deprecated version attribute access. No external data is processed, no untrusted input handling, and no suspicious code flows. The warning about deprecation is standard. No malicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical module initializer for a Flask-like package, with a deprecated version attribute that fetches package metadata. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The code is straightforward and safe.",
