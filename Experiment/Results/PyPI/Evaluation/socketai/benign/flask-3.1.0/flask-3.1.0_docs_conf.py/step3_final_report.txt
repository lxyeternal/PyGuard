  "purpose": "Configuration of Sphinx documentation for Flask, including custom URL link role for GitHub files based on version info.",
  "sources": "get_version function output, environment variables, user input text, app configuration (release).",
  "sinks": "URL construction for GitHub links, referencing versioned paths.",
  "flows": "Input text and version info are used to dynamically generate URLs in github_link role.",
  "anomalies": "None; URL generation based on controlled inputs, no obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs URLs for documentation links based on release version and user input, using standard libraries and safe practices. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The dynamic URL logic is typical for documentation systems and does not pose security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, safe Sphinx configuration with a custom role for linking to GitHub files. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The low risk scores are justified given the controlled URL generation based on version info and user input. No modifications to the assessments are necessary.",
