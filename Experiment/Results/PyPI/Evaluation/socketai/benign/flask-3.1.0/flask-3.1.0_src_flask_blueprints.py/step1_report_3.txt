{
  "purpose": "This code defines a subclass of SansioBlueprint for managing Flask-like blueprints, including static file serving and resource opening functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration values from current_app.config, input parameters such as filename and resource paths, and environment variables (implicitly through current_app).",
  "sinks": "File opening operations (open), data serving functions (send_from_directory), and configuration value usage (current_app.config) which could influence cache headers or file access.",
  "flows": "Configuration values from current_app.config influence cache age decisions; filename and resource parameters determine file access; send_from_directory uses static folder paths; open_resource reads files relative to root_path.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. No obfuscated code or unusual logic beyond standard Flask blueprint operations.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a typical implementation of Flask blueprint extension, handling static files, resource opening, and configuration-based caching. All functions use input parameters and configuration data to serve files or determine cache headers. There is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration routines. The code adheres to common patterns and makes safe use of file operations and configuration management.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Flask blueprint extension with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It properly manages file serving and resource access without insecure practices.",
