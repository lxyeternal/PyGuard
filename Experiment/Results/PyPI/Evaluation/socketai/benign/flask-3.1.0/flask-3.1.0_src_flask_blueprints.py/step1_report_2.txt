{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom Blueprint class for a Flask-like web application, extending functionality for static file serving and resource handling.",
  "sources": "Configuration values (current_app.config['SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT']), class attributes (name, static_folder, root_path), and input parameters (filename, resource, mode).",
  "sinks": "send_from_directory function (serving static files), open function (reading resource files).",
  "flows": "Configuration value retrieval flows into get_send_file_max_age; filename parameter flows into send_from_directory; resource and mode parameters flow into open_resource and open functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. Usage of open() for resource files is standard and limited to read modes; no suspicious command execution or network activity present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and custom components, defines a subclass of SansioBlueprint with additional methods for static file management and resource opening. No data from untrusted sources is processed directly; file paths are derived from class attributes and parameters. The get_send_file_max_age method retrieves cache settings from configuration; send_static_file and open_resource methods perform standard file serving and reading operations. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious network calls, or suspicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard extension of Flask's Blueprint for static file and resource management with no evident malicious intent or security risks. It performs typical functions with proper parameter handling and no suspicious behavior.",
