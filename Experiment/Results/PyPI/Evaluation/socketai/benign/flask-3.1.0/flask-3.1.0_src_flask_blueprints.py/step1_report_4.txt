{
  "purpose": "Define a custom Blueprint class for a Flask-like application, extending functionality and handling static files, resource opening, and configuration.",
  "sources": "Configuration access via current_app.config; input parameters such as filename and resource paths; environment variables (implicitly via os module); imported modules and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "send_from_directory function (serving static files); open function (reading resource files); access to current_app.config (potential data leakage if misused).",
  "flows": "Configuration values flow from current_app.config into get_send_file_max_age; filename parameter flows into send_static_file, which calls send_from_directory; resource parameter flows into open_resource and subsequently open.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns observed. The code primarily handles static files and resource access, with no suspicious external network calls, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a subclass of SansioBlueprint, adding methods for serving static files and opening resources. It accesses configuration values, primarily for cache control, and uses standard library functions for file I/O. The send_from_directory function and open calls are typical for static content handling. No input validation or external data processing that could lead to injection or malicious behavior is present. No hidden backdoors, secret exfiltration, or malicious network activity is evident. Usage of environment variables or environment-based configuration is minimal and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a Flask blueprint extension, focusing on static file handling and resource management. There are no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks within this module. The security risks are minimal, centered around proper use of file handling functions. Overall, the code seems safe and legitimate.",
