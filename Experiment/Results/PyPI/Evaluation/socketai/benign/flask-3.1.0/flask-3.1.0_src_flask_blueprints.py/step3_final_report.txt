{
  "purpose": "Provides a Flask-like Blueprint subclass for static file serving and resource management, handling configuration and input parameters.",
  "sources": "Configuration values (current_app.config), input parameters (filename, resource), class attributes (static_folder, root_path).",
  "sinks": "Filesystem access via send_from_directory and open functions, configuration influencing cache headers.",
  "flows": "Input parameters influence filesystem operations; configuration values determine cache duration; parameters flow into filesystem functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; standard validation present.",
  "analysis": "The code extends a Blueprint class, manages static files and resources with proper validation, and uses standard filesystem functions. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. Configuration values are used appropriately, and input validation for modes is implemented. No signs of malicious activity, network activity, or backdoors are evident. The code aligns with common Flask extension patterns and maintains security best practices within the scope.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, safe implementation for static file serving and resource management within a Flask-like framework. No malicious intent, obfuscation, or significant vulnerabilities are detected. The low malware score (0), obfuscated score (0), and minimal security risk (around 0.2) are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
