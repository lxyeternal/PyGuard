{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Blueprint class for a Flask-like web application, extending functionality for static file serving, resource opening, and CLI command grouping.",
  "sources": "Configuration data (current_app.config), input parameters (filename, resource, mode, encoding), class attributes (static_folder, root_path).",
  "sinks": "send_from_directory (serves static files), open() calls for resources.",
  "flows": "Configuration data influences cache age, static file serving, and resource opening; input parameters directly used in file system operations and HTTP responses.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No use of insecure functions beyond standard file operations. No obfuscated code present. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious actions observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides utility functions for static file handling and resource management within a web framework. It relies on configuration parameters and input arguments for safe file operations. The get_send_file_max_age method reads cache settings from the app config, and send_static_file serves static files using safe parameters. The open_resource method restricts file opening to read modes and constructs file paths safely using os.path.join. No untrusted data flows to unsafe sinks, no hardcoded secrets, nor suspicious dynamic code execution detected. All functions perform standard operations expected in a web framework context, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears safe, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. It implements standard file serving and resource management functions typical of a web framework, relying on configuration and input parameters without any suspicious or malicious patterns.",
