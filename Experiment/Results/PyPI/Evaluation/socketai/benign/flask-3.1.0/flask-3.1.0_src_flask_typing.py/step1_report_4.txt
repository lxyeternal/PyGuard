{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations and type aliases for HTTP response handling and application callbacks in a web framework, likely Flask or Werkzeug-based.",
  "sources": "Type hints and imports at the beginning; no external data sources or input reading; code primarily defines types.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or security-sensitive operations; no data leaks or malicious actions are apparent.",
  "flows": "Type annotations are used for static type checking; no runtime data flow or untrusted data processing is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only type alias definitions and import statements; no dynamic code, no input handling, no suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely focused on type hinting and defining data structures for HTTP response types and application lifecycle callbacks. It uses standard Python typing constructs and imports. No external data is read, and no data is written or transmitted. There are no apparent security risks, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. The code appears to be part of a larger framework's type annotations for better code clarity and static analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard type alias and class variable definition module for a web framework, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It is purely declarative and does not execute or handle runtime data.",
