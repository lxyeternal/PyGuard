  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code consists solely of type annotations, import statements, and type variable definitions. It notes no executable code, data processing, or external communication, and finds no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score of 0 is appropriate. Security risk is 0, as there are no vulnerabilities or malicious patterns.\n- **Potential issues:** None. The reasoning is sound and aligns with the code content.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, accurate, and consistent.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it correctly states that the code is purely type annotations with no runtime logic or data handling. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score of 0 is justified. No security risks are present.\n- **Potential issues:** None. The reasoning is consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** The analysis confirms the code is solely type annotations and import statements, with no runtime logic or external interactions. No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score of 0 is appropriate. Security risk is 0.\n- **Potential issues:** None.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the report accurately describes the code as purely type annotations and definitions, with no data processing or security concerns.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score of 0 and security risk of 0 are justified.\n- **Potential issues:** None.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly states that the code is a set of type annotations and aliases for static analysis, with no runtime or external communication.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score of 0 and security risk of 0 are appropriate.\n- **Potential issues:** None.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Risk scores:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate as there are no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\nGiven the analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is a standard, benign set of type annotations for a web framework, with no malicious or security issues.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and reasoning presented.",
