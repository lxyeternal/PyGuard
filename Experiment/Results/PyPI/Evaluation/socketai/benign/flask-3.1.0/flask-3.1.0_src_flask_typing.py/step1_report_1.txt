{
  "purpose": "Type definitions and type annotations for a web framework, likely Flask or Werkzeug-based, specifying various response types, headers, and callback functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library (typing, __future__), conditional import of types for type checking.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or external communication; primarily type annotations and type variables.",
  "flows": "Type annotations define data flow paths but do not execute runtime logic that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. The code is purely type annotations and import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type aliasing, import statements, and type variable definitions used for static type checking. No executable code, data processing, or external communication is present. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or backdoors. It is a typical type declaration file for a web framework, with no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of type definitions for a web framework's request and response handling. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be legitimate and purely for type checking purposes.",
