  "purpose": "Type annotations and interface definitions for a Flask/Werkzeug-based web application framework, specifying expected data types for responses, headers, callbacks, and routing functions.",
  "sources": "Type alias definitions and type variable declarations; import statements; conditional type checking blocks.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code primarily defines types and does not process untrusted input or perform data operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted inputs to sensitive sinks; the code only establishes type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code structures, or suspicious patterns observed. The use of type hints and conditional imports is standard for type checking.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type annotations, import statements, and conditional type checking for static analysis. It does not include runtime logic, input processing, or data handling. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. The structure adheres to typical Flask/Werkzeug typing practices. No malware-like activities, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code execution, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard type annotation module for a Flask/Werkzeug web application, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is purely for static type checking and does not perform any runtime operations that could pose security concerns.",
