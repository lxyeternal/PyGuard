  "purpose": "Type annotations and type variable definitions for a web framework, primarily for static type checking.",
  "sources": "Import statements and type alias declarations; no runtime data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, external communication, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; static type definitions without runtime execution.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, data handling, or suspicious patterns; straightforward type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type aliasing, import statements, and type variable definitions for a web framework, likely Flask or Werkzeug. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code is static and intended for type checking purposes only. All signals point to benign, standard practice code with no external data interactions or runtime logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of type annotations for a web framework, with no malicious intent or security issues. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis.",
