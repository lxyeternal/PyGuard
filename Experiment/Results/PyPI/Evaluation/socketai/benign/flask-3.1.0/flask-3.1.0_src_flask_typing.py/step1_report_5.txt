{
  "purpose": "The code defines type annotations and type aliases for a web application framework, likely Flask or Werkzeug, to facilitate static type checking and clarity of function signatures.",
  "sources": "Type annotations, import statements, and type alias definitions are sourced from the module itself and external packages such as werkzeug.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; the code mainly sets up type annotations and data structures.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow paths from untrusted sources to sinks; the code does not process or handle data directly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual behaviors are present; the code uses standard type annotations, conditional imports for type checking, and well-defined type aliases. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily contains type alias definitions for various response and request-related data structures used in a web framework context. It employs conditional imports guarded by type checking flags, and defines union types for different data formats. There are no operations involving input processing, data handling, or external communication that could pose security risks. The structure appears standard and well-formed for a type definition module. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of type annotations and aliases intended to aid static type checking within a web framework. It contains no malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors. It is safe and primarily used for documentation and type safety purposes.",
