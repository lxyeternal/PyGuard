  "purpose": "This code provides command-line interface utilities for managing and running Flask applications, including loading apps, running servers, shell, and route display commands.",
  "sources": "Data is read from user-provided command-line arguments, environment variables, imported modules, filesystem paths, and configuration files such as '.env' and '.flaskenv'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include loading environment variables into os.environ, importing modules dynamically, executing code via eval in shell command, and starting a server with run_simple which could expose network interfaces.",
  "flows": "Sources such as command-line options and environment variables flow into configuration and environment setup; environment setup influences app loading; app loading flows into server start or shell execution; dynamic module import and eval occur when handling user-supplied paths or code snippets.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval to execute code from PYTHONSTARTUP environment variable in shell command. Dynamic import_string and prepare_import for modules and SSL contexts may allow loading arbitrary code. No evidence of hardcoded credentials or backdoors. No obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles CLI interactions for Flask app management, including dynamic import of modules, environment variable management, and server execution. The use of eval for executing startup scripts is potentially risky if PYTHONSTARTUP points to malicious code, but this is a standard feature of Python shells. Dynamic module import and literal_eval parsing are controlled and intended for flexibility, not malicious activity. No signs of data exfiltration, system damage, or covert backdoors are present. The code correctly handles environment loading, app discovery, and command execution, with no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a CLI utility for Flask application management, with standard patterns and no malicious behavior detected. The eval on PYTHONSTARTUP could be misused if an attacker controls the environment variable, but this is a common Python feature and not inherently malicious. Overall, no malware or supply chain security risks are evident.",
