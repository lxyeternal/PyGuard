  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issue presence:** No malicious code, secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious external connections detected.  \n- **Logic/Reasoning:** Correctly identifies the code as a standard Flask app with request, response, error, and server management.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — seems reasonable given the code is standard.  \n- **Justification:** The low risk score aligns with the absence of malicious signals.  \n- **Overall:** Valid assessment; no changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; no malicious activity or obfuscation.  \n- **Logic/Reasoning:** Appropriately notes standard Flask patterns, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 — consistent with the code's nature.  \n- **Justification:** The very low risk score matches the lack of suspicious activity.  \n- **Overall:** Valid; no adjustments necessary.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issue presence:** No signs of malicious code, secrets, or obfuscation.  \n- **Logic/Reasoning:** Correctly states the code is typical Flask code, with no malicious signals.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — appropriate.  \n- **Overall:** Sound conclusion; no change needed.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issue presence:** No malicious activity, secrets, or obfuscation.  \n- **Logic/Reasoning:** Accurately describes the code as a standard Flask implementation, with no sabotage or malware.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 — consistent.  \n- **Overall:** Valid assessment; no adjustments.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; no malicious or obfuscated code.  \n- **Logic/Reasoning:** Correctly identifies the code as a typical Flask app with no malicious signals.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 — appropriate.  \n- **Overall:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as a standard Flask application with no malicious, obfuscated, or sabotage signals.\n- The scores assigned (malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk scores very low) are consistent with the code content.\n- No anomalies, secrets, or suspicious external connections are present.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** Given the code is a typical Flask app with no malicious signals, a risk score of around 0.1–0.2 is reasonable, reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code appears to be a legitimate, standard Flask application with no indicators of sabotage, malicious intent, or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code content.",
