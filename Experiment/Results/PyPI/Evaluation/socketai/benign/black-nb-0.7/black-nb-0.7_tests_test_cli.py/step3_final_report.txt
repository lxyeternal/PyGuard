{
  "purpose": "This code is a test suite for a CLI tool that formats Jupyter notebooks, clears outputs, handles invalid input, and manages encoding.",
  "sources": "Local filesystem directories and files, including test data directories and notebook files.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; all operations are confined to local file reads and CLI command invocations.",
  "flows": "Copies test data directories to temporary locations, invokes CLI commands on these directories, reads notebook files for verification.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected; standard testing practices are used.",
  "analysis": "The code performs directory copying, file reading, and CLI command invocation within a controlled test environment. It does not execute untrusted code, access external systems, or handle sensitive data. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities are present. The operations are straightforward and confined to local filesystem interactions, with no network activity or dynamic code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test suite with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0 are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
