  "purpose": "Configure and run code quality and testing tools for a Python project using nox.",
  "sources": "File reads: noxfile.py, black_nb, tests; Dependency installations: mypy, flake8, black, pytest.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no untrusted data is outputted or sent over network.",
  "flows": "Sources are used to install dependencies and specify code paths; no untrusted input is processed or outputted.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or suspicious behavior observed. The code straightforwardly manages development tools.",
  "analysis": "The script imports nox and defines multiple sessions for static analysis, code formatting, and testing. It installs dependencies like mypy, flake8, black, and pytest, then runs these tools on specified sources. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling is present. The code appears standard for a Python project setup, with no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical configuration script for a Python project’s development workflow. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data flows, and performs standard development tasks. It is safe and does not pose security risks.",
