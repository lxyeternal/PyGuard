  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and uses standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code defines nox sessions for mypy, flake8, black, and pytest, installing dependencies and running commands on predefined sources. It does not process untrusted input, perform network activity, or contain obfuscated or malicious code. The code structure is clear, and the commands are standard for Python project maintenance. No suspicious patterns, secrets, or backdoors are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign configuration script for project automation, posing no security risks or malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify it as safe, and the scores are appropriate.",
