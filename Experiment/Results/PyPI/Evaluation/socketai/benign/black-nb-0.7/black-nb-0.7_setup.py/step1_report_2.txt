  "purpose": "Setuptools configuration for packaging and distributing the 'black-nb' Python project, which applies the black formatter to Jupyter notebook code cells.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; no input from external sources at runtime.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external output processing observed.",
  "flows": "None; the script performs standard setup operations without data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and standard for a Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily imports Path for file handling and setuptools for package setup. It reads a README.md file for the long description, then calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or obfuscated patterns are present. All dependencies are standard and well-known, with no hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic. The code functions as a typical setup script for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup configuration for a Python package named 'black-nb'. It contains no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It performs standard packaging tasks without any suspicious or malicious elements.",
