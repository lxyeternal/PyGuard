  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'black-nb' that applies the black code formatter to Jupyter notebooks.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; importing setuptools and find_packages; reading package dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs are processed or executed beyond standard setup operations.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows indicating malicious activity; the code only reads local files and defines package setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected. Usage is consistent with standard package setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical setup tasks: reading a README file, defining package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. No untrusted data processing or dynamic code execution occurs. It does not download, execute, or connect to external sources beyond standard setup configurations. All actions align with common Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It only reads local files and configures package installation parameters.",
