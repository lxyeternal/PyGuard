      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured notebook formatter that employs magic command masking solely for formatting purposes. There is no evidence of malicious activity, sabotage, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), all consistent with the benign nature of the script."

      "conclusion": "The supply chain security reports are generally accurate and consistent with their analyses. The high suspicion in Report 4 is justified by the presence of obfuscation and dynamic code execution, warranting further review. Other reports correctly identify benign or low-risk code. The current scoring system appropriately reflects the assessed threat levels based on the available information."
