  "conclusion": "The supply chain security reports are generally accurate and consistent with their analyses. The high suspicion in Report 4 is justified by the presence of obfuscation and dynamic code execution, warranting further review. Other reports correctly identify benign or low-risk code. The current scoring system appropriately reflects the assessed threat levels based on the available information."
