{
  "purpose": "This code is a specialized formatter for Jupyter notebooks, utilizing the Black code formatter to reformat code cells while handling notebook-specific features such as magic commands through masking functions.",
  "sources": "Reads notebook files via nbformat.read(), processes cell contents, and configuration options from pyproject.toml.",
  "sinks": "Writes formatted notebooks back to disk via nbformat.write(); no external network or system calls are involved.",
  "flows": "Reads notebook JSON, masks magic commands, formats code with Black, unmask magic commands, and writes back the updated notebook.",
  "anomalies": "Uses hide_magic() and reveal_magic() functions to mask and unmask notebook magic commands, which could be misinterpreted as obfuscation but are intended for formatting compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The script employs standard libraries and techniques for reading, formatting, and writing notebooks. The masking functions serve as a workaround for handling magic commands during formatting, not for malicious obfuscation. No network activity, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are present. Error handling is appropriate, and the code structure is consistent with a legitimate formatting utility. The masking functions are a known technique to preserve magic commands without breaking formatting, not malicious code. The overall behavior is benign, with no suspicious patterns or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured notebook formatter that employs magic command masking solely for formatting purposes. There is no evidence of malicious activity, sabotage, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), all consistent with the benign nature of the script.",
