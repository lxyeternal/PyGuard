  "purpose": "Elasticsearch log handler for Airflow, managing log ingestion, retrieval, and formatting with Elasticsearch.",
  "sources": "URL validation, log ID rendering, Elasticsearch queries, log formatting functions, external URL generation.",
  "sinks": "Elasticsearch API endpoints for counting, searching, and bulk inserting logs; external log URL endpoints.",
  "flows": "Source: configuration and log data → sink: Elasticsearch API calls (count, search, bulk) → potential output: logs stored or retrieved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard URL validation, constructs log IDs based on task and DAG info, uses Elasticsearch helpers for bulk insertion, and retrieves logs via search queries. Exception handling is appropriate, and no obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The logic aligns with typical log handler implementations, and the code is structured clearly. No signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured Elasticsearch log handler for Airflow, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low risk score (~0.1-0.2) are justified based on the analysis.",
