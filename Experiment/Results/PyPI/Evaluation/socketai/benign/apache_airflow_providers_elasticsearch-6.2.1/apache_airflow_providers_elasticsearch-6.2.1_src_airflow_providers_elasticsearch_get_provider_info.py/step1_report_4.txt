{
  "purpose": "Provides configuration and metadata for the apache-airflow-providers-elasticsearch package, including version info, dependencies, and connection options.",
  "sources": "Reads static configuration data, dependency specifications, and metadata from the code itself.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes or transmits untrusted data; primarily static data and configuration.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; code does not process or execute external input dynamically.",
  "anomalies": "The code is automatically generated, static, and contains no user input processing. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious patterns are detected. No obfuscated or dynamic code present. The data and logic are typical for a configuration file.",
  "analysis": "The script is a static, auto-generated configuration provider that returns metadata, version info, dependencies, and connection options for an Airflow Elasticsearch provider. It contains no user input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no network operations. It is a straightforward data container with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. The structure and content are typical of generated package metadata files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a configuration/data provider for the package. No malicious activity, malware, or security risks are evident. It is purely declarative, with no signs of malicious intent.",
