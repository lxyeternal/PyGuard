  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is static, auto-generated, and only returns package metadata and configuration options.\n- No external data sources, user inputs, or dynamic code execution are involved.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious URLs are present.\n- No obfuscation, malicious patterns, or signs of malware are detected.\n- The code's purpose appears purely informational and configuration-related.\n\n**Specific review of each report:**\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Metadata/configuration provider.\n- **Analysis:** No dynamic behavior, no suspicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, no security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Similar to above, static package metadata.\n- **Analysis:** No dynamic or malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard configuration code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Same as previous, static data return.\n- **Analysis:** No input/output handling or suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, no risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — justified.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Metadata/config for Elasticsearch provider.\n- **Analysis:** Static, auto-generated, no malicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** No security issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Similar static configuration data.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, normal package metadata code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Code presence:** The code is purely static, with no dynamic or malicious behavior.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None detected; the reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- **Scores justification:** All reports assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0, which are reasonable given the code's nature.\n- **Potential for higher scores:** Since there's no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks, raising scores would be unjustified.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is a static, auto-generated configuration module with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nI concur with the reports' evaluations. The code is safe, benign, and serves as a static package metadata provider.",
