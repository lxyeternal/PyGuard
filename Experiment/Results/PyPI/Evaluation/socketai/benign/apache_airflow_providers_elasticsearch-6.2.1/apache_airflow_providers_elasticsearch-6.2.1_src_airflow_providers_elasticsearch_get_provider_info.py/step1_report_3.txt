  "purpose": "This code defines a function that returns metadata and configuration information about the 'apache-airflow-providers-elasticsearch' package, including version info, integrations, hooks, connection types, logging, and configuration options.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data within the function return statement; no input or external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data output or external data sinks are present. The code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted input; the code only returns a static dictionary of configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "The code is purely static, generated, and contains no dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are detected. No input validation, environment variables, or network interactions are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a static, auto-generated Python function returning a detailed dictionary with package metadata, configuration options, and dependencies. It does not perform any input handling, external communication, or dynamic code execution. The function solely provides package information. No code injection, malicious behaviors, or security risks are identified within this static code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, static metadata function with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is part of a package configuration and contains no suspicious or malicious logic.",
