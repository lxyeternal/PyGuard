  "purpose": "Custom JSON formatter for airflow logging, converting log records to ISO 8601 format with timezone info.",
  "sources": "The code reads the log record's creation timestamp (`record.created`) and milliseconds (`record.msecs`).",
  "sinks": "The code formats and returns a timestamp string; it does not write to external systems or handle untrusted input beyond log record timestamps.",
  "flows": "The timestamp (`record.created`) is retrieved, converted to a timezone-aware datetime, formatted as a string with optional milliseconds and timezone info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard Python libraries and conventional formatting; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from JSONFormatter to format log timestamps in ISO 8601 format. It securely uses standard libraries (`datetime`, `pendulum`) to handle timestamps. No user input is directly processed, nor are external data sources accessed beyond the timestamp. The formatting logic is straightforward and uses standard methods. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging formatter extension that formats timestamps. It poses no security threats, contains no malware, and does not exhibit obfuscated or malicious behavior.",
