{
  "purpose": "To format log records into JSON with ISO 8601 date/time format for use in Airflow logging.",
  "sources": "The record.created attribute (timestamp) and record.msecs (milliseconds) from log records.",
  "sinks": "The formatted date/time string returned by formatTime, which may be used in log outputs.",
  "flows": "The timestamp from record.created flows through datetime.fromtimestamp, is formatted via strftime, and appended with timezone info.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious functions present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party modules (datetime, pendulum, airflow utils). It defines a subclass of JSONFormatter, overriding formatTime to produce ISO 8601 timestamp strings with timezone info. The timestamp is derived from the log record's creation time, converted to local timezone. The code is straightforward, with clear intent to format timestamps for logging. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious data flows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate logging formatter designed for Airflow, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply formats timestamps for logs.",
