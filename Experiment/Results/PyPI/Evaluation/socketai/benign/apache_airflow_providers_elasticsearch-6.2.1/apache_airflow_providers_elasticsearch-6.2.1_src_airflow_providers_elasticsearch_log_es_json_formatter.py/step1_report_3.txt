  "purpose": "Custom JSON log formatter for Airflow, converting log records to ISO 8601 format with timezone.",
  "sources": "Record creation timestamp (`record.created`), timezone via `pendulum.local_timezone()`",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data is written out or used insecurely",
  "flows": "Uses `record.created` as source, formats timestamp with `strftime`, no external sinks involved",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and standard for logging formatting",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of a JSON formatter that formats timestamp data for logs. It converts a timestamp to a timezone-aware datetime, formats it as ISO 8601, and adds milliseconds and timezone info. The code uses `pendulum` for timezone, which is a reputable library. No user input, environment variables, or external data is processed insecurely. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are present. The code does not perform any network operations, file manipulations, or data leaks. It is a standard log formatter implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard logging formatter for Airflow, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
