  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign timestamp formatter for Airflow logs with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly assess the code as safe, with malware scores of 0 and very low security risk scores (~0.1). The slight variation in risk scores (some at 0, some at 0.1) is acceptable given the minimal security implications. Overall, the code poses no supply chain or security threat."
