  "purpose": "A custom JSON formatter for Airflow logs that converts log record timestamps into ISO 8601 format with timezone information.",
  "sources": "Reads 'record.created' and 'record.msecs' from log records to generate formatted timestamps.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; only formats internal timestamp data for logging purposes.",
  "flows": "Source: 'record.created' and 'record.msecs' -> Formatter's 'formatTime' method -> formatted timestamp string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward use of standard libraries; no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code subclasses a JSON formatter to convert timestamps into ISO 8601 format with timezone info, using 'datetime' and 'pendulum'. It performs simple timestamp formatting without external data, network calls, or security-sensitive operations. The code is clear, well-structured, and relies on reputable libraries. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic are present. The TODO comment indicates potential future improvements but does not introduce security concerns. The code's purpose is benign, serving as a logging utility, and does not process untrusted input beyond internal timestamp data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign timestamp formatter for Airflow logs with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly assess the code as safe, with malware scores of 0 and very low security risk scores (~0.1). The slight variation in risk scores (some at 0, some at 0.1) is acceptable given the minimal security implications. Overall, the code poses no supply chain or security threat.",
