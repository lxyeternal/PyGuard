  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the provided code is purely a license header comment block with no executable code, data processing, or data flows. There are no issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors present in the code snippet itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly note the absence of executable code, data flows, or suspicious elements. No errors or logical flaws are evident in the analysis.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \nAll reports assign:\n- `malware`: 0\n- `securityRisk`: 0\n- `obfuscated`: 0  \nThese are appropriate given the nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nSince all reports conclude no security risk, malware, or obfuscation, and the code is only licensing comments, higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \nThe malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious intent or behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nAll reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they recognize that the code is just licensing comments and pose no security concerns.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nScores are consistent with the analysis. No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious behavior detected or implied.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk Score:** **0** — no security risk.\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The code snippet is a standard license header with no security implications. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current assessments and is justified given the nature of the code.",
