{
  "purpose": "Define a utility function to retrieve the current Apache Airflow version as a tuple of major, minor, and micro versions, and establish boolean flags for version comparisons.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module attribute '__version__' from the 'airflow' package and imports 'Version' from 'packaging.version'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not directly write or send data to untrusted sources or network destinations.",
  "flows": "The version string '__version__' is retrieved, parsed into a 'Version' object, then used in comparison operations to set flags.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code structures are observed. The code appears straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated parts, or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and functions to parse the version of the 'airflow' package. It then creates a function that returns the version as a tuple of integers. The flags 'AIRFLOW_V_2_10_PLUS' and 'AIRFLOW_V_3_0_PLUS' are set based on whether the current version meets certain thresholds. All operations are standard version comparisons without any unusual or suspicious behavior. No external or untrusted data handling or network activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign version check for the 'airflow' package, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It simply facilitates version-dependent behavior in a larger codebase.",
