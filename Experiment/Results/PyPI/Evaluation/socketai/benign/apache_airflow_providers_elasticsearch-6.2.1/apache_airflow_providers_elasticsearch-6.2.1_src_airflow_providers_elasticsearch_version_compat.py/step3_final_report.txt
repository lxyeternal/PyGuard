  "purpose": "Determine the installed version of the airflow package and set flags based on version thresholds for compatibility or feature toggling.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __version__ attribute from the airflow module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "The version string from airflow.__version__ is parsed into a Version object, then compared to fixed version tuples to set boolean flags.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version parsing and comparison. No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports __version__ from airflow and Version from packaging.version. It defines a function to parse the version string into a tuple of major, minor, micro. It then sets boolean flags based on whether the current version is >= 2.10.0 and >= 3.0.0. The logic is standard, safe, and does not handle untrusted input beyond the version string. No network, file, or malicious behavior is present. The code is clear, well-structured, and performs a benign version check.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version comparison utility with no malicious intent or security issues. The assigned scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0 are appropriate and justified.",
