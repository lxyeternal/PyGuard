  "review": "Let's review the reports carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward implementation that retrieves the `__version__` attribute from the `airflow` module, parses it into a `Version` object, and sets boolean flags based on version thresholds.\n- No untrusted data handling, no network activity, no file operations, no data exfiltration, and no hardcoded secrets are present.\n- The logic is standard, clear, and well-structured.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are observed.\n- The purpose is purely for compatibility checks or feature toggling based on version.\n\n**Malware and Obfuscation Scores:**\n\n- All reports assign malware = 0 and obfuscated = 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The code does not perform any malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n**Security Risk:**\n\n- The security risk is consistently 0 across reports, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Score justifications:**\n\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- The confidence level is 1, indicating high certainty.\n- No changes are necessary; the assessments are accurate.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n\n- The only minor consideration is that the code imports `Version` and `__version__` at runtime, which could theoretically be manipulated if the environment is compromised, but this is standard practice and not inherently risky.\n- No evidence of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n\n- Based on the provided code and reports, I agree with the assigned scores:\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior observed)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (benign version check with no security implications)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, safe implementation for version detection and comparison. No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
