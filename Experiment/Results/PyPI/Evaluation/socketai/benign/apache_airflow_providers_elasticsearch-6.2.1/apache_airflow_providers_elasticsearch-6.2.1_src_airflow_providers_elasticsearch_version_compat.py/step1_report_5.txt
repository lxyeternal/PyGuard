{
  "purpose": "To determine the base version of Apache Airflow installed, likely for compatibility or feature toggling.",
  "sources": "Import of __version__ from airflow package, which reads the installed Airflow version.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code does not write or send data outside the environment.",
  "flows": "The version string (__version__) is read and converted into a Version object, then compared to specified version tuples.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code follows standard practices for version comparison. No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network or system actions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports __version__ from airflow and uses packaging.version.Version to parse it. It then returns the major, minor, and micro components as a tuple. The two constants AIRFLOW_V_2_10_PLUS and AIRFLOW_V_3_0_PLUS are boolean flags indicating whether the installed version is greater than or equal to specific versions. All operations are read-only and for version checking purposes. The code is well-structured, uses standard libraries, and contains no suspicious behavior or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a benign version check for Apache Airflow without any malicious behavior. It is a standard implementation for conditional logic based on versioning.",
