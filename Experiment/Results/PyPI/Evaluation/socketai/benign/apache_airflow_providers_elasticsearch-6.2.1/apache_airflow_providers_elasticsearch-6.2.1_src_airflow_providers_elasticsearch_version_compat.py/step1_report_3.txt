{
  "purpose": "Define functions and constants to determine the installed version of Apache Airflow and compare it against specific version thresholds.",
  "sources": "__version__ from airflow module, imported within the function",
  "sinks": "No direct sink or untrusted data output; version info is retrieved from internal module data",
  "flows": "The version string from airflow.__version__ is read and processed by the Version class, then compared against fixed tuples",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior; the code is standard version checking logic",
  "analysis": "The code imports the __version__ attribute from airflow, then uses the packaging.version.Version class to parse it, extracting major, minor, and micro version components. It then defines boolean constants based on version comparisons. The approach is straightforward, with no indication of obfuscated or malicious intent. The code's purpose is to facilitate compatibility checks in provider modules, and it does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or execute untrusted input.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard version checking for the airflow package without any malicious behavior or security risks. It simply retrieves and compares the package version, serving a compatibility purpose.",
