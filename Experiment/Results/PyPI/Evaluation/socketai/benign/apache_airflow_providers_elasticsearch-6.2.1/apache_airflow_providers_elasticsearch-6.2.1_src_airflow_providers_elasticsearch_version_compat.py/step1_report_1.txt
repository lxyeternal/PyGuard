{
  "purpose": "This code determines the installed version of the Apache Airflow package and sets boolean flags based on version thresholds.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Airflow version from the __version__ attribute in the airflow module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is used; the code only reads a version string and performs version comparisons.",
  "flows": "The version string from airflow.__version__ flows into the packaging.version.Version constructor, then to the comparison tuples.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors; straightforward version parsing and comparison.",
  "analysis": "The code imports __future__.annotations for forward compatibility, then defines a function that imports the Version class from packaging.version and the __version__ attribute from airflow. It creates a Version object to parse the version string and returns a tuple of major, minor, and micro version numbers. Then, it sets two boolean flags based on whether the current Airflow version is greater than or equal to 2.10.0 and 3.0.0 respectively. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors observed. The code is standard version checking logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard version comparison to set feature flags; no malicious activity or security risks are present.",
