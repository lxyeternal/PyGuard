  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its purpose, and the scores assigned.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code's purpose is to determine the installed version of Apache Airflow and set flags based on version thresholds.\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, uses standard libraries, and performs benign version comparisons.\n- No untrusted data, network activity, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n- The code is not obfuscated, does not contain hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code imports `__version__` from the airflow package and `Version` from `packaging.version`.\n- It creates a function to parse the version string into a tuple of integers.\n- It sets boolean flags based on version comparisons.\n\n**Scores:**\n- All reports assign malware score = 0, obfuscated = 0, and security risk = 0.\n- Confidence is 1, indicating high certainty that the analysis is correct.\n- The purpose and analysis are consistent across reports.\n\n**Critical evaluation:**\n- The logic is straightforward and standard for version checking.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The version comparison is safe and typical.\n\n**Potential issues or overestimations:**\n- None identified. The code is simple and benign.\n- The scores are appropriate; no need to increase malware or security risk scores.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are accurate.\n- The assigned scores are reasonable.\n- The code poses no security threat.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity observed)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, readable code)  \n**Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Note:** If I were to assign scores independently, I would agree with the reports' assessments. The code is benign, straightforward, and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard version check utility with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
