{
  "purpose": "To determine the base version of the Airflow package installed, likely for compatibility or feature toggling purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __version__ attribute from the airflow package and imports the Version class from packaging.version.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that handle untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves the airflow version, converts it into a Version object, and compares it to predefined version tuples to set boolean flags.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code follows standard practices for version checking. No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the airflow version string, converts it into a Version object for semantic comparison, and sets flags based on the version. It appears to be a straightforward compatibility check. No suspicious data flows, backdoors, or malicious patterns observed. The code does not perform any network activity, file operations, or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard version compatibility check function, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The code is benign and well-structured for its purpose.",
