  "purpose": "The code provides classes for handling Elasticsearch responses, enabling attribute-like access to response data and metadata.",
  "sources": "Input dictionaries during object initialization, particularly the response data from Elasticsearch queries.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious effects; data is only read and wrapped for attribute access.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input dictionaries into class attributes and properties, with no dynamic execution or external calls involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious patterns detected. The code is straightforward data encapsulation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility classes that wrap Elasticsearch response data for easier attribute access. It reads data from input dictionaries, provides attribute and item access, and manages metadata and hits. No external network calls, code injection, or dynamic execution are present. The only potential concern is reliance on external methods like '_get_result', but within this snippet, no malicious activity is evident. The code does not perform any operations that could be exploited or lead to security vulnerabilities. It is a standard, benign utility for data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard data wrapper for Elasticsearch responses with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is appropriately low (~0.1), considering it processes untrusted data but does not act maliciously.",
