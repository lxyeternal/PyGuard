{
  "purpose": "The code defines helper classes for managing and accessing Elasticsearch response data with attribute-like syntax, including classes for hits and metadata.",
  "sources": "No explicit sources of input beyond the provided data structures within the classes; data is passed into constructors.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks, system effects, or malicious actions; mainly data encapsulation and access.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input dictionaries into class instances; attribute access and lazy evaluation in `hits` property process and wrap response data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic observed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external network calls.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of classes that wrap Elasticsearch response data, enabling attribute-like access. Data flows from response dicts into class instances, with lazy processing for hits. No evidence of data leakage, malicious behavior, or security issues. No suspicious patterns, external calls, or obfuscated code are present. The structure appears clean, standard for data encapsulation, and adheres to good practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data access layer for Elasticsearch responses, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It operates solely on provided data structures, with no external dependencies or network activity. Overall, it appears safe.",
