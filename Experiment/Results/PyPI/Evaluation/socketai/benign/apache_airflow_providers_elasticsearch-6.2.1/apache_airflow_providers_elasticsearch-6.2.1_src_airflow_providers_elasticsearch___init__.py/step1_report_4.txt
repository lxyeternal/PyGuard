{
  "purpose": "The code sets the version information for a Python package and enforces a minimum required version of Apache Airflow.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__ and packaging.version, access to airflow.__version__.",
  "sinks": "The RuntimeError raised if the airflow version is below 2.9.0.",
  "flows": "The airflow version is parsed and compared; if below 2.9.0, a RuntimeError is triggered.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward; no suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines package metadata, and enforces a version check for airflow. It raises an error if the airflow version does not meet the minimum requirement, which is a standard practice for dependency validation. No data is sent externally, no code injection or malicious logic is present, and no obfuscation is used.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard version check for a package, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It enforces dependency requirements and contains no malicious or security risk behaviors.",
