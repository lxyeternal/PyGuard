  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is auto-generated boilerplate for version validation.\n- It imports standard libraries, reads the Airflow version, and raises an exception if the version is below 2.9.0.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- No external data sinks, network activity, or hardcoded secrets.\n- The purpose is clearly to enforce environment compatibility.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Summary:** Correctly identifies the code as auto-generated, mainly for version validation.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate assessment. No issues.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the straightforward nature of the code.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious or suspicious behavior; standard version check.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (very low, as it’s just version validation).\n- **Verdict:** Slightly elevated securityRisk (0.1) seems reasonable, but no actual vulnerabilities.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Summary:** Confirms the code's purpose as version validation.\n- **Analysis:** No external data, no malicious behavior.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard dependency validation.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious activity.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Summary:** Same as others, ensuring compatibility.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; I agree with a malware score of 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** The code is straightforward and auto-generated, with no obfuscation. Score = 0 is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** The only slight concern is the potential for version enforcement to cause denial of service if misused, but this is a standard practice. The small risk score of 0.1 in report 2 seems reasonable; otherwise, 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores given in all reports are consistent with the code’s nature.\n- No modifications needed.\n- The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (to reflect the minimal impact of version enforcement, but generally negligible)\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms that the code is standard, boilerplate validation logic with no security concerns.",
