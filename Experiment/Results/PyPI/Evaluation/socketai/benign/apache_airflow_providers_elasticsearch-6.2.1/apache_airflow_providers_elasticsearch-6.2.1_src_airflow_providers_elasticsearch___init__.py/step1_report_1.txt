{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be an auto-generated Python module for an Apache Airflow provider package, mainly for version validation and module metadata definition.",
  "sources": "Reads the `airflow.__version__` variable to determine the installed Airflow version.",
  "sinks": "Uses the version check to potentially raise a RuntimeError if the version condition is not met.",
  "flows": "Reads `airflow.__version__` -> Parses version -> Compares versions -> May raise RuntimeError based on the comparison.",
  "anomalies": "The version check is standard; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. The code is auto-generated, which may obscure intentional or unintentional issues, but nothing suspicious is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports version parsing utilities, reads the Airflow version, and raises an exception if the version is below 2.9.0. It is mostly boilerplate, auto-generated, and designed for environment validation. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are present, such as network activity, data leaks, or backdoors. The code’s primary function is version validation with standard import and string handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard boilerplate for version validation in an auto-generated Python module. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks, only version checking logic. No anomalies or malicious intent are identified.",
