{
  "purpose": "This code sets up version checking for an Apache Airflow provider package, ensuring compatibility with a minimum required version of Airflow.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Airflow version via an imported variable `airflow_version`.",
  "sinks": "The code performs a version comparison and potentially raises a RuntimeError if the version condition is not met.",
  "flows": "The code flows from reading the imported `airflow_version` to parsing and comparing it, then to raising an exception if the condition fails.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. The only action is a version check and exception raising.",
  "analysis": "The code imports version handling libraries, retrieves the current Airflow version, and compares it to a minimum required version. If the current version is below 2.9.0, it raises an error to prevent incompatible usage. The code is straightforward, mainly performing version validation. No data leaks, external communications, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is primarily configuration and validation logic, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version check for ensuring compatibility of a package with a required version of Apache Airflow. It contains no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a typical validation snippet, and its structure is clear and appropriate for its purpose.",
