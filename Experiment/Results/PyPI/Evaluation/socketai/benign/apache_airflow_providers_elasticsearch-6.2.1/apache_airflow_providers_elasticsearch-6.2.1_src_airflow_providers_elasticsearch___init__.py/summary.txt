  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard dependency validation boilerplate with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its purpose and nature. The malware and obfuscated scores are appropriately zero. The security risk score should be set to 0 across all reports, as the code does not pose any security threat. The confidence in this assessment is high (1)."
