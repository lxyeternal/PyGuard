{
  "purpose": "This code performs a version check for the Apache Airflow package, ensuring it meets the minimum required version (2.9.0). It raises an error if the environment does not satisfy this requirement.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'airflow.__version__' attribute to determine the installed Airflow version.",
  "sinks": "Raises a RuntimeError if the version is below 2.9.0, which halts execution; no external data sinks or network activity are present.",
  "flows": "Source: airflow.__version__ is parsed and compared; sink: RuntimeError is raised upon version mismatch.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is auto-generated boilerplate with straightforward logic. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the airflow version, parses it using packaging.version, and compares it to a minimum version. If the installed version is less than 2.9.0, it raises a RuntimeError. The code is standard for dependency validation, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It does not perform any network activity, data leaks, or obfuscation. The logic is simple and clear, serving a compatibility enforcement purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard dependency validation boilerplate with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its purpose and nature. The malware and obfuscated scores are appropriately zero. The security risk score should be set to 0 across all reports, as the code does not pose any security threat. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
