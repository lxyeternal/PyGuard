  "purpose": "This code appears to be a part of a package initialization or validation script for an Apache Airflow provider, verifying version compatibility.",
  "sources": "Reads the Airflow version via import from the airflow package.",
  "sinks": "Raises a RuntimeError if the Airflow version is below 2.9.0.",
  "flows": "Imports airflow version -> compares version -> raises error if condition not met.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code; standard version check and import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, retrieves the installed Airflow version, and compares it to a minimum required version. It raises an exception if the version is incompatible. No external data inputs or outputs are involved beyond standard package import and exception raising. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behavior detected. The code serves a typical validation purpose in a package setup context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version check for compatibility purposes, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It functions to prevent installation with incompatible Airflow versions.",
