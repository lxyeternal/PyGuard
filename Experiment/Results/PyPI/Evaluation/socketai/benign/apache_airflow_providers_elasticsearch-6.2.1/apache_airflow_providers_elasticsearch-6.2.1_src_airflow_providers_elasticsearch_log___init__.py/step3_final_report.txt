  "purpose": "This code contains only license header comments with no executable code or dynamic behavior, serving solely as licensing boilerplate.",
  "sources": "The license header comments themselves, which are static text and do not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks, as no untrusted data is processed or leads to any effect.",
  "flows": "No data flows exist; the code is purely comments with no runtime or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual constructs are present; the content is standard license boilerplate.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of license comments with no executable statements, data processing, or dynamic behavior. All reviews correctly identify the absence of malicious code, obfuscation, or security issues. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the content. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected. The code poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign license boilerplate with no executable or suspicious content. The scores are accurate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
