      "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard dynamic library loading without malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary security risk is the potential for loading tampered or malicious libraries if the filesystem is compromised. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.4 to 0.6 depending on environment trust assumptions. To improve security, adding checksum or signature verification for libraries before loading is recommended."

      "conclusion": "The import statement is benign and standard. The primary security concern is the trustworthiness of the 'lib_rocksdb' module. No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident in this code snippet. Scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a low risk score reflecting the need to verify the module's source. If the module is from a trusted source, no further action is necessary; otherwise, review or sandboxing is advisable."
