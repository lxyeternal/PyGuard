  "purpose": "Define abstract interfaces for comparison, merging, filtering, and transformation operations in a data processing system.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data sources; class definitions only.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data or untrusted input processed or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow; purely abstract class definitions with no executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated Python 2 style '__metaclass__' syntax; no malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of abstract base classes for various data operations, employing Python 2 syntax. There are no concrete implementations, data handling, network calls, or executable logic. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are present. The use of outdated syntax is noted but does not impact security. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code and assign malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores as zero. Confidence levels are high, and the assessments are consistent and justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of interface definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
