{
  "purpose": "Define abstract base classes for various interfaces used in a system, possibly related to data comparison, merging, filtering, and transformation.",
  "sources": "No input sources or data reading operations are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations, especially no untrusted data handling or network transmission, are present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows in this code.",
  "anomalies": "Code uses Python 2 style metaclass declarations (__metaclass__), which are outdated but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. No obfuscated or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several abstract base classes with abstract methods, primarily serving as interface contracts. No input/output operations, data handling, or system commands are present. Usage of ABCMeta for defining interfaces is standard, albeit using deprecated Python 2 syntax. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected. The code appears to be a structural component rather than executable logic, reducing risk.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code consists of interface definitions for a data processing system. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard, non-malicious, structural code snippet.",
