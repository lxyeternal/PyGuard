  "review": "Let's review each report carefully, focusing on the details provided, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** The code is a set of abstract class definitions using Python 2 style `__metaclass__` syntax. No data handling, external calls, or executable logic. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Score justification:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0. The confidence is high (1). The analysis is consistent.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues here. The code is purely interface definitions with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on outdated `__metaclass__` syntax. No data processing or external interactions. No malicious intent.\n- **Score justification:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0. Confidence is 0.9, which is reasonable given the outdated syntax but not malicious.\n\n**Assessment:** No security issues. The use of deprecated syntax is noted but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same as above—interface definitions, no data or network operations, no signs of malicious code.\n- **Score justification:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0. Fully consistent.\n\n**Assessment:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar structure, purely interface classes, no data handling or external calls.\n- **Score justification:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0. Confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** No security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same as previous, interface definitions only, no malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Score justification:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0. Confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Presence of malware:** All reports consistently indicate the code is only abstract class/interface definitions with no executable or malicious content. No signs of malware or malicious payloads.\n- **Obfuscation:** The use of Python 2 style `__metaclass__` syntax is outdated but not obfuscation or malicious.\n- **Security risk:** Given the absence of data handling, external calls, or executable logic, the risk is negligible.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (not obfuscated; outdated syntax but not obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Note:** While the code employs outdated syntax, this does not elevate the security risk or malware suspicion.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard set of interface definitions for a larger data processing system, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0",
