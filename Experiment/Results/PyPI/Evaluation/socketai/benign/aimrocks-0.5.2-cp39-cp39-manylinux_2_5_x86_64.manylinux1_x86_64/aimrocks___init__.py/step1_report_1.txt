  "purpose": "Import all contents from the local module 'lib_rocksdb' to be used in the current package.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads data from a local module file 'lib_rocksdb'.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks such as network connections, file writes, or execution of untrusted data in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident within this single import statement; it merely includes external code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no anomalies such as obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs are visible. The import is relative, which can sometimes be used to hide malicious modules, but on its own, this is not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard relative import of a module named 'lib_rocksdb'. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code in this snippet. However, without inspecting 'lib_rocksdb' itself, it is impossible to determine if the imported module contains malicious code. The import pattern alone is common in Python packages. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent in this single line.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there is no evidence of malicious behavior. The code appears to be a typical module import. However, further review of 'lib_rocksdb' is recommended to ensure it does not contain malicious code.",
