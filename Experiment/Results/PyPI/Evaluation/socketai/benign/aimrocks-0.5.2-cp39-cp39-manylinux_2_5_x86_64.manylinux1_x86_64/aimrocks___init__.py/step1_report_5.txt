  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the local module 'lib_rocksdb'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local or package module",
  "sinks": "No sinks are explicitly present in this single import statement",
  "flows": "No data flow is explicitly shown; only an import statement is present",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can obscure what is being imported, but this alone is not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are visible",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single import statement importing everything from a local module 'lib_rocksdb'. This pattern is common in Python projects and does not inherently indicate malicious intent. Without additional context or code, there are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. The import could be used for database interactions, but no malicious activity can be inferred from this snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement with no evident malicious intent or security risks. The use of 'import *' is generally discouraged but not inherently malicious. No malicious behavior or security issues are detectable from this isolated line.",
