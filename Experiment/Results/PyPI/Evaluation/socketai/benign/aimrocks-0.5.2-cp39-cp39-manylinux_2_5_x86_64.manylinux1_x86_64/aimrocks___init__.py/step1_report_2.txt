{
  "purpose": "Importing all components from a local module named lib_rocksdb, likely for database operations.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself is a source of code execution if the module lib_rocksdb contains malicious code or dynamic execution upon import.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are evident in this single import statement; potential sinks depend on subsequent use of the imported module.",
  "flows": "Potentially, the imported lib_rocksdb module could execute malicious code upon import, which then could be used downstream.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a relative import without further context is not inherently suspicious, but it could hide malicious code if the module itself is compromised. The statement alone is minimal and not malicious, but warrants review of the lib_rocksdb module itself.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs a relative import from lib_rocksdb. This import could execute malicious code if the module has malicious content. Since the code does not show what is inside lib_rocksdb, we cannot determine if it is malicious. The import statement alone is not suspicious but depends on the integrity of the imported module. No other code, inputs, or sinks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is a simple import statement, which by itself is not malicious. However, the security risk depends entirely on the contents and source of the lib_rocksdb module. Without examining that module, the risk cannot be fully assessed. No malicious behavior is evident from this snippet alone.",
