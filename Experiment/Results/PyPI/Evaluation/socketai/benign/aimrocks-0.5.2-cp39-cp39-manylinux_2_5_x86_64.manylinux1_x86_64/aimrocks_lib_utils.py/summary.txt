  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard dynamic library loading without malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary security risk is the potential for loading tampered or malicious libraries if the filesystem is compromised. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.4 to 0.6 depending on environment trust assumptions. To improve security, adding checksum or signature verification for libraries before loading is recommended."
