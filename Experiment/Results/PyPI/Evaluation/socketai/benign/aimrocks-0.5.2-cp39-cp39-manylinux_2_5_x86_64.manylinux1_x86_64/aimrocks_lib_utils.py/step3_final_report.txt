  "purpose": "Dynamically loads shared libraries from the local filesystem based on platform-specific filename patterns.",
  "sources": "Filesystem directory containing shared libraries matching patterns like 'lib*.so*' or 'lib*.dylib'.",
  "sinks": "ctypes.CDLL invocation loading the shared library into the process.",
  "flows": "Filesystem pattern matching to locate library files -> selecting a single file -> loading via ctypes.CDLL.",
  "anomalies": "Use of assert to enforce exactly one matching library, no verification of library integrity or signatures, no network activity, no obfuscation or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs paths relative to its directory, matches library files using glob patterns, and loads them dynamically. It does not contain obfuscated code or malicious payloads. The main security concern is the lack of verification of the library files before loading, which could be exploited if an attacker replaces or manipulates the files in the directory. The use of assert may cause runtime errors if multiple files match, but does not introduce security vulnerabilities. Overall, the code is straightforward and standard for dynamic library loading, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard dynamic library loading without malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary security risk is the potential for loading tampered or malicious libraries if the filesystem is compromised. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.4 to 0.6 depending on environment trust assumptions. To improve security, adding checksum or signature verification for libraries before loading is recommended.",
