  "purpose": "The code loads shared libraries from the local directory, presumably for a larger application that requires these libraries at runtime.",
  "sources": "os.path.dirname(__file__), os.path.abspath(), glob.glob(), platform.system()",
  "sinks": "ctypes.CDLL(path) - dynamically loads shared libraries into the process",
  "flows": "get_libs() -> get_lib_filename() -> load_lib() -> ctypes.CDLL()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic code execution. The print statement for library loading is benign but could be used for logging purposes. No network activity or file modifications are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code determines directory paths relative to the current script, identifies shared library files matching platform-specific patterns, and loads them dynamically using ctypes.CDLL. It asserts only one matching library per name, reducing ambiguity. There are no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The print statement could leak information if logs are exposed but is otherwise benign. The code's structure is straightforward, with no suspicious obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for loading local shared libraries. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks in the provided code.",
