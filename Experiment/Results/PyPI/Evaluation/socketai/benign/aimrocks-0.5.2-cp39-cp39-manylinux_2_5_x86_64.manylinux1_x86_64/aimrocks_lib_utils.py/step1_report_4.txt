{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to locate, identify, and load shared libraries (specifically 'rocksdb') from local directories, likely for use in a larger application or extension.",
  "sources": "Reads from __file__ to determine current directory, uses glob to list files matching library patterns.",
  "sinks": "Loads libraries using ctypes.CDLL, which executes the library code.",
  "flows": "File system paths are constructed based on script location -> glob searches for libraries -> paths are used to load libraries into the process.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code. Use of ctypes.CDLL to load local libraries is typical but can be risky if library files are tampered with. No external network activity or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically locates shared library files matching naming patterns based on the OS. It then loads these libraries into the process via ctypes.CDLL. The approach is straightforward and does not involve any suspicious data handling or external communication. The only potential risk is if the library files are malicious or tampered with, as loading arbitrary shared libraries can execute malicious code, but this is a normal pattern for plugin systems or extension modules. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are evident. The code does not obfuscate or hide its behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard library loader that dynamically loads specific shared libraries from the local filesystem. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior within this code segment. The primary security consideration is ensuring that the library files being loaded are trustworthy and untampered.",
