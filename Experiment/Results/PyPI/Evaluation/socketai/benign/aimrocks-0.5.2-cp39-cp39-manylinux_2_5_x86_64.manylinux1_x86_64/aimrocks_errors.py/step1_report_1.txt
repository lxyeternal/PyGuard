  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for specific error conditions related to file or data handling.",
  "sources": "No input sources are present; the code only defines classes.",
  "sinks": "No data processing, output, or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths as the code solely contains class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The code consists of straightforward exception class declarations.",
  "analysis": "The code declares multiple custom exception classes inheriting from Exception. These classes are used to represent specific error conditions and do not contain any logic, data processing, or external interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads. The classes are simple, standard Python exception definitions with no embedded code, data leaks, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely definitional, establishing custom exception classes without any malicious intent or security risks. It poses no threat or malicious behavior. The code is standard and benign.",
