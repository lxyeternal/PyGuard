  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code content, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from `Exception`.\n- There are no data flows, external interactions, or logic.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious behavior.\n- The purpose across reports is consistent: defining error classes for various systems or modules.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code **matches** the description: pure class definitions with no embedded logic or external effects.\n- No errors, flaws, or malicious patterns are present.\n- The code is straightforward, standard Python exception class declarations.\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- Purpose: Define custom exceptions for file/data handling.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code. No issues.\n\n#### Report 2:\n- Purpose: Custom exceptions for RocksDB or similar systems.\n- Scores: same as above, all zero, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n#### Report 3:\n- Purpose: Custom error handling scenarios.\n- Scores: all zero, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n#### Report 4:\n- Purpose: Custom exceptions for various error conditions.\n- Scores: all zero, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n#### Report 5:\n- Purpose: Error handling in a Python app.\n- Scores: all zero, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Are any scores unreasonable?\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is accurate.\n- Obfuscated score is 0, appropriate.\n- Security risk is 0, justified.\n- Confidence is 1, since the analysis is straightforward.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- No suspicious activity, obfuscation, or malware is present.\n- The code is purely definitional.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores across all reports are consistent and justified.\n- No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward class definitions)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is benign, standard, and poses no security threat. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the content.\n\n**Final conclusion:** The code is purely defining custom exception classes with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores reflect this accurately.",
