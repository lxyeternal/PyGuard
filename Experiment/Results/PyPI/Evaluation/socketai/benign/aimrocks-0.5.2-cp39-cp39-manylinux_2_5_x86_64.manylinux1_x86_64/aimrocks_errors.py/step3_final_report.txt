  "purpose": "Define multiple custom exception classes for error handling in a Python application.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from Exception, no data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs; purely class declarations.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow or external interactions present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions with no logic, data handling, or external calls. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is typical for error handling modules and is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, benign, and purely definitional. No malicious intent or security risks are detected. The existing scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1 are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
