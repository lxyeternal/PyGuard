  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to ensure the scores are justified and consistent with the code.\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n- The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from Exception.\n- There are no data flows, external interactions, or logic.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The purpose appears to be for error handling within a larger application.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Define custom exception classes.\n- **Findings:** Only class definitions, no data, no external interactions.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, straightforward.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Custom exceptions for RocksDB or similar systems.\n- **Findings:** Same as above, only class definitions.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Error handling scenarios.\n- **Findings:** Only class definitions.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious code or behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Error handling in Python.\n- **Findings:** Only class definitions.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious or suspicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Error handling.\n- **Findings:** Only class definitions.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- All reports are consistent in their assessment: the code is purely definitional with no malicious intent or obfuscation.\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is justified.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, as there is no obfuscation.\n- The security risk is 0, as no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present.\n- Confidence is 1, indicating high certainty.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n- As a security researcher, I agree with the assessments: this code is benign and poses no security risks.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's nature.\n\n**In conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.",
