  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for specific error handling scenarios.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data sources; exception class definitions do not read input.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs; exception classes do not handle or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink, as classes are simple exception definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code consists solely of standard exception class declarations with no suspicious or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exceptions inheriting from Python's Exception class. These are straightforward class definitions with no additional logic, data handling, or external interactions. No hardcoded credentials, external calls, obfuscation, or malicious code constructs are present. The code appears to be a typical pattern for custom error handling in Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard and benign, serving only to define custom exception types. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
