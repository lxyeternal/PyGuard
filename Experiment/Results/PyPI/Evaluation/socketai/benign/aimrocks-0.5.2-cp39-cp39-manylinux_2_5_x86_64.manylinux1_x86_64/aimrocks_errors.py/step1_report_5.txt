  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a Python application.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reads; only class definitions for exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or external effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows; these are simple class declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hidden behavior, or obfuscation present. The classes are straightforward exception definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple custom exception class definitions, all inheriting from Exception. No data input, environment variable access, network calls, or dynamic execution present. The structure is standard for custom error handling. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of standard exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security issues. It does not perform any operations beyond defining exceptions.",
