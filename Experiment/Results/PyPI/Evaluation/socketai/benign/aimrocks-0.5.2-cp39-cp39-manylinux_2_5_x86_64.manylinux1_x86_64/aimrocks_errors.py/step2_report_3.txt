  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\nThe code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class. These classes are purely declarative, with no methods, logic, data handling, or external interactions.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code\n- The code contains only class definitions for exceptions. No operational code, data processing, or external dependencies.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or embedded payloads.\n- No anomalies or suspicious constructs.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues or malicious activity are present in the code.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Review the logic, reasoning, and summary in reports\n- All reports correctly identify that these are straightforward exception class definitions.\n- They consistently note the absence of data flow, external interactions, or malicious code.\n- No anomalies, secrets, or obfuscation are detected.\n- The reasoning is sound and aligns with the code content.\n\n**Potential issues:** None. The reports are accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Review scores assigned to each issue\n- All reports assign:\n  - confidence: 1\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - malware: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n\nThese scores are reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Suggestion:** No changes needed. The scores accurately reflect the benign, straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Justify any high risk scores\n- All scores are zero for malware and security risk.\n- The code is purely definitional, with no operational or external impact.\n- Therefore, risk scores are appropriately low.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Challenge claims based on assumptions\n- The reports do not assume any malicious intent; they explicitly state the code is benign.\n- No suspicious behavior or assumptions are made beyond the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Consistency of scores with the report\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- No discrepancies observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final step: My assessment and recommendations\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, just to acknowledge it's a code definition, but no risk)\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is entirely benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements.\n- The minimal risk score reflects that it’s a simple class definition with no operational impact.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The code is straightforward, benign, and poses no security threat.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The scores are appropriate; no adjustments necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Maintain the current scores, or set risk to 0.1 for completeness.\n- No malware or obfuscation concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Overall, I agree with the reports' assessments. The code is safe, and the scoring reflects that accurately.**",
