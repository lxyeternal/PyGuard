  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling related to RocksDB or similar systems.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data sources are read; these are only class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing occurs; no data leaks or external effects are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; simply defining exception classes without any logic or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code structures detected; straightforward class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of defining custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, with no additional logic, data handling, or external interactions. The classes are likely intended for use elsewhere in a larger application. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The code appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of simple, well-defined custom exception classes used for error handling. It poses no security risk, contains no malware, and exhibits no obfuscation or suspicious activity.",
