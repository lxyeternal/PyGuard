{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for various error conditions",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes without input or data reading",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or untrusted data handling occurs",
  "flows": "None; no execution flow involving data input or output",
  "anomalies": "Simple class definitions for exceptions; no unusual code or secrets",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of custom exception class definitions inheriting from Python's Exception base class. There are no data inputs, no external dependencies, no dynamic code execution, or any other suspicious behavior. This code appears to serve as a foundation for error handling within a larger system, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious behavior. It simply establishes custom exception classes for potential use elsewhere.",
