  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine if the conclusions and scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as only defining custom exception classes inheriting from `Exception`.\n- No input/output, data processing, external calls, or logic are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are identified.\n- The code appears to be straightforward, standard practice for error handling.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the presence of issues in the code\n\n**Does the code contain any issues?**  \nNo. The code only defines exception classes with no logic, data handling, or external interactions. All reports are consistent in stating this.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues present.\n\n---\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning\n\n**Are there any errors or flaws?**  \n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign, simple class definitions.\n- They correctly state that there are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The analysis is consistent and accurate.\n\n**No errors or flaws are apparent.**\n\n---\n\n### Scores assigned to each issue\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 for all reports, which is appropriate.\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports, which is appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** 0 for all reports, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n**Are the scores reasonable?**  \nYes, they align with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5\n\n- Since all reports assign a risk of 0, and the code is benign, there's no justification for higher scores.\n- The code is purely definitional with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Malware scores and potential malicious behavior\n\n- All reports assign malware score = 0, which is correct.\n- No signs of malicious code, payloads, or obfuscation.\n\n**Confirmed:** Malware score should remain 0.\n\n---\n\n### Challenging claims based on assumptions\n\n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that the code is benign.\n- No overreach in their analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency of scores with the reports\n\n- All scores are consistent with the described code and analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment\n\n**Based on the evidence, I would assign the following scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| **0**   | **0**        | **0** |\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- The code is simple class definitions with no malicious or obfuscated elements.  \n- No security risks are present.  \n- The risk score remains at 0, as there's no threat.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n- **The code is benign, standard, and poses no security threat.**  \n- **All reports are accurate and consistent.**  \n- **Scores are appropriate and should remain at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk.**\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nThis is a straightforward case of defining custom exceptions, common in Python projects, with no security concerns.",
