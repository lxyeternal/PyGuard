{
  "purpose": "To provide a list of translation strings for Babel extraction and automate the extraction process.",
  "sources": "Import statement for lazy_gettext from flask_babel and the list auto_translations_import that uses this function to generate translatable strings.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of the lazy_gettext function, which defers translation but does not process untrusted input directly.",
  "flows": "The code imports a translation function and applies it to static string literals, resulting in a list of translation keys used for extraction.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code is straightforward, contains only static translation strings, and does not perform any data processing or network operations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a translation utility (lazy_gettext) for internationalization purposes and creates a list of static strings wrapped with this function, intended for extraction by Babel. There are no sources of untrusted input, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior. The module is marked as unused, serving solely for translation extraction automation. No malicious or security-related concerns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely for internationalization string extraction. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It is a simple, static code snippet with no dangerous operations.",
