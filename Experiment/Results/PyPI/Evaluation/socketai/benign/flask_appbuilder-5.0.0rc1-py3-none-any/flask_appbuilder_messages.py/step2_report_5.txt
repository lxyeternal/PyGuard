  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, scores, and potential risks.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is static, intended solely for Babel extraction.\n- No dynamic data, user input, or external data sources are involved.\n- The code uses `lazy_gettext` to mark translation strings, which is standard for internationalization.\n- The module is marked as unused, with no runtime functionality, which aligns with its purpose as a utility for extraction.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence:** The code matches the description: import from `flask_babel`, static list of translation strings, no other logic.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of malware, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** No vulnerabilities are apparent; static strings and no data processing.\n\n### Issues or anomalies:\n- The only minor anomaly is that the list `auto_translations_import` is unused, but this is explicitly acknowledged and not problematic.\n- No obfuscation, no dynamic code, no data leaks.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Confidence:** 1 in all reports — justified, as the analysis is consistent and thorough.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — correct, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Malware:** 0 — justified, no malicious behavior.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — justified, no vulnerabilities or risks.\n\n### Risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- All scores are 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; no need to adjust scores.\n- The purpose of the code is clear: static translation placeholders for Babel extraction.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nBased on all reports and the code, I concur that:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is a benign utility for internationalization, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe, static, and purpose-built for translation extraction.\n- No malicious or risky behavior is present.\n- Scores are appropriate; no changes needed.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and consensus across all reports.",
