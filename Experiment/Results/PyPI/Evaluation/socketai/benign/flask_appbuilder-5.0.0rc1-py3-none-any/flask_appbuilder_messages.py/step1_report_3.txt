  "purpose": "This module is intended to be used solely for Babel extraction automation by listing translation strings.",
  "sources": "The code reads static translation strings via the lazy_gettext function calls.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present that could lead to data leaks or security issues; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "Static strings are stored in a list; no dynamic or untrusted data flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "The module contains an unused list of translation strings, which is unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a localization function, defines an unused list with translation strings meant for extraction, and includes a comment clarifying its purpose. No dynamic code execution, no input handling, no data leaks, and no suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only as a placeholder for translation extraction. There is no malicious behavior or security risk detected.",
