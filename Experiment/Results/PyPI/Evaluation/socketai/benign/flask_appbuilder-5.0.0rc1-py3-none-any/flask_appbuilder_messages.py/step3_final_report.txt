  "purpose": "Static module used solely for Babel translation extraction, containing a list of translation strings wrapped with lazy_gettext.",
  "sources": "Import of lazy_gettext from flask_babel and static list of translation strings",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows; static code with no runtime data processing",
  "flows": "N/A; static list of strings used for extraction, no data flow or execution at runtime",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, unused, and explicitly marked as not used in runtime",
  "analysis": "The code imports a translation function and defines a static list of translation strings for Babel extraction. It contains no dynamic code, user input, network activity, or data leaks. All reports correctly identify it as a benign, static utility with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's nature. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code's purpose is clear, and it poses no security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The module is a benign, static utility for translation extraction with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concerns. The scores are appropriate and justified.",
