{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to provide placeholder translations for Babel extraction, not for actual runtime use.",
  "sources": "The code reads string literals for translation functions (_).",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or leaked.",
  "flows": "The flow is from static string literals to a list intended for extraction; no dynamic or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code imports a translation function and creates a list of translation calls without any runtime logic. It explicitly states it's not used and only for extraction purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'lazy_gettext' as '_', then defines a list of translation calls for common UI terms, all as static string literals. It includes a comment indicating it's unused and only for Babel extraction. There are no user inputs, external data sources, or dynamic behaviors. No obfuscated code, malicious functions, or suspicious activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for translation extraction with no malicious intent or security risks. It contains no sensitive data or malicious behavior, merely static translation placeholders.",
