{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to serve as a placeholder or utility for extracting translations with Flask-Babel, with no active functionality.",
  "sources": "Import from 'flask_babel' and string literals within the list 'auto_translations_import'",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing that could lead to data leaks or vulnerabilities",
  "flows": "The source (import) flows into the list of translation strings, which are not used elsewhere",
  "anomalies": "The module contains a comment indicating it is not used, and the translation list is static; no dynamic or unsafe code present",
  "analysis": "The module imports a translation function '_', then creates a list of translations using that function. The comment suggests the module's purpose is for Babel extraction, not runtime use. No user input, data processing, or security-sensitive operations are present. No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module used for translation extraction purposes. There are no malicious behaviors, security risks, or anomalies identified.",
