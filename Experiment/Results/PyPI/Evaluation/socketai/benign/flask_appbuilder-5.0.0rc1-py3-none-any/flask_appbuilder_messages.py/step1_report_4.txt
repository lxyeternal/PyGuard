{
  "purpose": "This module is used solely to automate Babel extraction for translation purposes.",
  "sources": "The code imports a localization function from 'flask_babel' and uses it to generate a list of translatable strings.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The source is the function '_()' used to mark strings for translation, and it populates the 'auto_translations_import' list; there are no further data flows to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and contains no unusual or suspicious code constructs. The module is unused but intended for translation extraction.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a translation function and creates a list of strings marked for localization, serving as a placeholder for Babel to extract translation keys. No data is processed from untrusted sources, no dynamic code execution, and no credentials or sensitive information are involved. The module appears benign and purpose-built for internationalization tooling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration file used to facilitate translation extraction. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
