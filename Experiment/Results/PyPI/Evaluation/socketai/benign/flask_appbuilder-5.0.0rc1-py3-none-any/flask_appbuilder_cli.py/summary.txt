  "conclusion": "The code is primarily legitimate setup and management utility for Flask applications. It does not contain malware or obfuscated code. The main security risks relate to supply chain vulnerabilities from external ZIP downloads and the use of system commands without validation. Overall, the code is low risk but warrants cautious handling of external dependencies and command execution practices."
