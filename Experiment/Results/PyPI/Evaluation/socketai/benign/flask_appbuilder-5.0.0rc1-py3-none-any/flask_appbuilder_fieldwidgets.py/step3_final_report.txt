  "purpose": "Rendering custom date, datetime, text, password, and select widgets for Flask forms with safe HTML output.",
  "sources": "Field data (field.data), field identifiers (field.id, field.name), label text (field.label.text), widget parameters (kwargs), endpoint URLs (for AJAX widgets).",
  "sinks": "HTML output via Markup, html_params generating HTML attributes and input elements.",
  "flows": "Field data and attributes flow into html_params to generate HTML attributes, which are inserted into HTML templates and returned as Markup for rendering.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Use of Markup and html_params is standard for safe HTML rendering. No network calls or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple UI widget classes for Flask forms, primarily for date/time pickers, text inputs, password fields, and AJAX-based select widgets. All classes set default attributes, handle field data safely, and generate HTML using standard Flask-WTForms patterns. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is present. The use of Markup and html_params is consistent with safe HTML practices. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to HTML rendering, which is mitigated by proper use of Markup. No external network activity or data leakage is evident. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.1, reflecting the low inherent risk of dynamic HTML rendering in controlled environments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard, safe, and free of malicious or obfuscated content. The widget implementations are straightforward and do not introduce security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
