{
  "purpose": "Define custom widget classes for rendering various form input elements with Bootstrap 3 and Select2 AJAX functionalities in a Flask web application.",
  "sources": "Imports from Flask-Babel (_), Markup from markupsafe, and WTForms widgets; usage of field data and label attributes; internal HTML templates and string formatting.",
  "sinks": "Rendering functions returning Markup objects with formatted HTML; dynamic attribute assignment in widget __call__ methods.",
  "flows": "Field data (source) is inserted into HTML templates and output as safe Markup (sink); no untrusted data is processed or used in dangerous contexts outside basic HTML rendering.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. Usage of internal HTML templates and dynamic attribute setting appears standard. No evidence of code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors. The code handles data securely in the context of rendering form inputs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple widget classes for form inputs, mainly focusing on UI presentation with Bootstrap and Select2 integration. It uses safe string formatting and the Markup class to prevent injection issues. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network communication, data theft, or hidden backdoors. The only dynamic aspect involves inserting field data into HTML, which is handled securely via html_params and Markup. No use of eval, exec, or dangerous functions observed. The code appears to be straightforward UI component definitions without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of form widget classes for UI rendering in Flask, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It safely constructs HTML snippets for form fields, and no harmful or suspicious activity is detected.",
