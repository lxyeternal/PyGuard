  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** The report states the code is standard, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious network endpoints. It correctly identifies that the code is for rendering form widgets with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. The confidence is 1, which is appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no issues detected. The report's conclusion aligns with the code.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on safe data handling, no network activity, and standard practices. Slightly lower confidence (0.9) but still consistent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2. The securityRisk is slightly above zero, but given the code's nature, this is a cautious but acceptable score.\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious behavior or vulnerabilities identified. The minor securityRisk score could be justified due to the use of Markup and html_params, but these are standard.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Again, the analysis confirms the code is standard, with safe rendering practices, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1. Confidence is 0.9, which is appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; no issues.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports; the code is straightforward UI rendering code, with no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. The confidence is 1, matching the findings.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is solid.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** The report again confirms the code is standard, safe, and free of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1. Confidence is 1.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior; malware=0 is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports are correct in noting no obfuscation; obfuscated=0 is appropriate.\n- **Security risk score:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1-0.2), which is cautious but acceptable given the code's purpose and implementation.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a set of well-structured, standard form widget classes for Flask applications.\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present.\n- The use of Markup and html_params is standard for safe HTML rendering.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The scores reflect a low-security risk, which is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (to account for the use of Markup, which is generally safe but warrants cautious scoring)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content and security posture.",
