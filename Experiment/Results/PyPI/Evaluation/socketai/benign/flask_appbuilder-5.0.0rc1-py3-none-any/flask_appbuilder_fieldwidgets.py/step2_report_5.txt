  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, scoring consistency, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines standard form widgets for date, datetime, text, password, and select fields with AJAX support. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected.\n- **Findings:** The report correctly notes that the code is standard, safe, and uses Flask/WTForms conventions. No malware, obfuscation, or security risks identified.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing safe HTML rendering, standard practices, and no malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** The code's data flow is straightforward, with no network activity or data exfiltration. Use of `Markup()` and `html_params()` is standard and safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 seems slightly high but still acceptable given the context of dynamic HTML generation, which is common in web UI code.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is for UI widgets, with safe data handling, no malicious activity, and standard patterns.\n- **Findings:** The report correctly identifies no malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate, no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar positive assessment; no malicious or suspicious activity detected.\n- **Findings:** The code is straightforward, uses safe HTML rendering, and no malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 are justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Consistent with previous reports; safe, standard widget code with no malicious intent.\n- **Findings:** No network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation observed.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. Given the code is purely UI rendering with no network or data exfiltration, a malware score of 0 is justified.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation is present in any report; 0 is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** All are low (0 or 0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal security risk.\n\n### Final expert evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports — no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2) is acceptable, considering the dynamic HTML rendering, but overall very low.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — considering the code's purpose and lack of vulnerabilities, this is a conservative, justified score.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, consistent, and appropriately cautious. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present, and the risk scores are reasonable given the context.",
