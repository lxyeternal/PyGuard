  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The report concludes the code is legitimate, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is standard widget code, generating safe HTML for form controls. No signs of malicious activity, network calls, or data exfiltration.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No change needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with a slightly lower confidence (0.9). No malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n- **Assessment:** The low securityRisk score (0.2) seems reasonable, given the code's nature. The report emphasizes safe data handling and standard practices.\n- **Verdict:** Scores seem appropriate. No change needed.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, with high confidence (0.9). No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior. The minimal securityRisk score is justified.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Again, the code is straightforward UI widget code with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The code is purely for rendering form controls.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to others, with no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate, given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there are no signs of malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate; the code is straightforward, not obfuscated.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Ranges from 0 to 0.2, which is reasonable considering the code's purpose and lack of vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores across all reports are consistent and justified.\n- No modifications needed; the assessments are accurate.\n\n### My Own Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (minimal, mostly related to potential HTML injection if user data isn't sanitized, but the code uses html_params and Markup to mitigate this)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code appears safe from a supply chain security perspective.",
