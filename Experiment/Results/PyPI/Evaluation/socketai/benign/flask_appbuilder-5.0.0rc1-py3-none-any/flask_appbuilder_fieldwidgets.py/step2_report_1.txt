  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious activity detected. The code is standard widget implementation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no issues found. The confidence is high (1).\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, no malicious activity, code injection, or obfuscation. Data flows are straightforward and safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — slightly above zero, but the reasoning suggests very low risk.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning justifies a low securityRisk score. Malware remains at 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Again, standard UI widget code with safe data handling. No malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — minimal risk.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the low risk scores. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports; no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Well-reasoned, consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Consistent with others; no malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious code is present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, clear code.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1 or 0.2), reflecting very low security risk, which is justified given the code's nature.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\nBased on the detailed review, I agree with the scores assigned in all reports. The code is standard, safe, and free of malicious or obfuscated content.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (a very low but non-zero value reflecting minimal inherent risk in dynamic HTML rendering, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious activity)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No further adjustments are necessary.",
