  "purpose": "Define custom form widgets for date, datetime, text, password, and select fields with AJAX support in a Flask web application.",
  "sources": "Input data from form fields (field.data), widget initialization parameters, and user-provided keyword arguments.",
  "sinks": "HTML markup rendering via Markup, usage of html_params for HTML attributes, potential injection points in templates.",
  "flows": "Input data (field.data) incorporated into HTML templates via string formatting and html_params, output rendered as Markup objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network endpoints or data exfiltration code. Use of dynamic HTML generation is standard for form widgets.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of widget classes for rendering HTML form controls with optional styling and AJAX capabilities. It uses safe string templating and the Flask/WTForms ecosystem conventions. There are no signs of malicious code such as network calls, data leaks, or hidden backdoors. The data injection points are limited to template rendering for form controls, which is typical for web UI components. The code does not include any obfuscation, hidden execution, or external data collection mechanisms. All dynamic parts are related to HTML rendering and styling, with no indication of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities beyond normal UI rendering concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate, standard widget implementations for a Flask application. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It provides customizable form controls with optional AJAX integration without any security risks or malware indications.",
