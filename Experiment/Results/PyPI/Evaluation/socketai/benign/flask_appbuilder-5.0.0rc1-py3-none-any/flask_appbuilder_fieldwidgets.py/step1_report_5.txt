  "purpose": "Provide custom widget classes for date pickers, text inputs, password fields, and AJAX-based select elements for Flask-WTForms integration.",
  "sources": "The code reads from class attributes, method parameters, and external function calls such as html_params and field attributes.",
  "sinks": "Markup output for rendering HTML widgets, usage of html_params for HTML attribute generation, and string formatting for HTML templates.",
  "flows": "Field attributes and method parameters influence the HTML output via string formatting and html_params, with no external or untrusted input processing evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns observed. Usage of external libraries appears standard. No obfuscated code, code injection, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines various custom widget classes for form inputs, primarily generating HTML markup using static templates and safe parameter passing. No user input is processed in a manner that would lead to code execution or data leakage. The html_params function is used solely for HTML attribute rendering, and Markup is used to mark the HTML as safe. No network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior are evident. The code appears to be well-structured for UI rendering purposes without security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of form widget definitions intended for rendering UI components in Flask applications. It does not contain malicious behavior, malicious payloads, or security risks. It is safe for use from a supply chain security perspective.",
