  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their findings with the actual code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Finds no malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity. Considers the code legitimate, standard widget implementations.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** The report is consistent with the code. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Also finds no malicious activity, no obfuscation, and the code follows standard practices. Notes that data flows are straightforward and safe.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 (slightly above zero, but justified as low risk)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The assessment aligns with the code. The slightly elevated security risk score (0.2) is acceptable given the nature of HTML rendering, but overall, the code remains safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, confirms no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity. Emphasizes safe data handling via html_params and Markup.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Finds no malicious code, suspicious behaviors, or security risks. Recognizes the code as straightforward widget rendering logic.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Also confirms no malicious payloads, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors. Recognizes the code as safe for supply chain purposes.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Presence of issues in code:** No. All reports correctly identify that the code is standard UI widget rendering code with no malicious or suspicious activity.\n- **Malware indication:** None. All reports assign malware score 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; all agree on 0.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1–0.2), reflecting the minimal risk associated with dynamic HTML rendering, but overall very low.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is purely for rendering HTML form controls with no network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads.\n- Use of `Markup()` and `html_params()` is standard for safe HTML rendering, assuming the data is sanitized or controlled.\n- No obfuscation, no hardcoded credentials, no suspicious URLs or code.\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (very low, just acknowledging minimal risks inherent in dynamic HTML rendering)\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code appears safe and legitimate from a supply chain security perspective.",
