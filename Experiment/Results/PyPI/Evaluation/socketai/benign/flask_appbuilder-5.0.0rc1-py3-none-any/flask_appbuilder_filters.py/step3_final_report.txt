  "purpose": "Provides Flask Jinja template filters for URL generation, permission checks, and view interactions within a web application.",
  "sources": "Request data (request.args, request.view_args), class attributes, external security_manager, view objects.",
  "sinks": "url_for function, attribute access, permission validation via security_manager, URL string construction.",
  "flows": "Input from request and view objects flows into URL functions and permission checks; permission results influence view rendering.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns detected; URL manipulations are standard for web apps.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Flask utility module implementing template filters for URL management and permission validation. It relies on request data and external security_manager for access control. No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or secrets are present. The URL parameter manipulations are typical and handled safely within the context. The permission checks depend on the security_manager, which appears standard. Overall, the code is benign, well-structured, and aligns with common web application practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for Flask applications, with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is appropriately low (~0.2). The assessments are consistent and accurate.",
