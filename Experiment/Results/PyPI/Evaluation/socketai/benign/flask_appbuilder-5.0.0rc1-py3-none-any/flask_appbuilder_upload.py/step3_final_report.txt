  "purpose": "Defines custom Flask-WTForms fields and widgets for file and image uploads, handling upload, deletion, validation, and display, relying on external file management classes.",
  "sources": "Form data inputs, file streams, external file management classes (FileManager, ImageManager)",
  "sinks": "File storage via external managers, HTML rendering for upload and delete controls",
  "flows": "User input -> validation -> file handling via external classes -> form object population",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity detected",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard file/image upload form fields with validation and deletion logic. It uses external classes for file operations, with validation for allowed file types. No malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or covert channels are present. The code is straightforward, readable, and follows best practices. External dependencies are critical; if compromised, risks could increase, but based solely on this code, no malicious intent or security flaws are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, standard implementation of Flask upload fields with proper validation and handling. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation are present. The overall security posture is low risk, assuming external classes are trustworthy.",
