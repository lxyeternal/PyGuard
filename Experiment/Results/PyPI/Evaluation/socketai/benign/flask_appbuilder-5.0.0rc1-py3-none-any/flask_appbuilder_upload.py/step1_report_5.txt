{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom form fields and widgets for file and image uploads within a Flask web application, enabling handling of file storage, deletion, and display functionalities.",
  "sources": "Input data from form submissions via formdata parameter in process methods; file content from self.data.stream; file extension validation via self.data.filename.",
  "sinks": "File storage operations through self.filemanager.save_file and self.imagemanager.save_file; deletion operations via self.filemanager.delete_file and self.imagemanager.delete_file.",
  "flows": "Form data is processed to detect delete commands; if delete, process_on_delete is called; if storing a new file, process_on_store is called, and the file is saved via filemanager or imagemananger, then filename is assigned to object attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code, reverse shells, or network communications observed; no suspicious domain connections; use of dynamic attribute setting is standard; no malware-like behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard custom form fields for file/image upload, including delete and store logic, with validation for file extensions. It uses external managers for file handling, which are not detailed here. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior are apparent. The processing methods are placeholders meant for customization. No hidden or malicious actions are evident. All data flows and sink points are typical for file upload handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate, intended for handling file and image uploads in a web form, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It adheres to common patterns for secure file management in web applications.",
