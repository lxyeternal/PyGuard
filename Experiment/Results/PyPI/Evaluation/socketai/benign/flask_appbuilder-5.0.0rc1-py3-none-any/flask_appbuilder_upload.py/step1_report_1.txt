{
  "purpose": "The code provides custom Flask-WTForms fields and widgets for file and image uploads, with mechanisms for handling uploads, deletions, and display.",
  "sources": "Input data from form submissions via formdata in process() methods; file data from FileStorage objects during upload.",
  "sinks": "File storage operations such as save_file() and delete_file(); HTML rendering with html_params; get_url() method for retrieving image URLs.",
  "flows": "Form data (including delete markers) flows from process() to populate_obj(); uploaded file data flows through process_on_store() and save_file() methods; delete markers trigger process_on_delete().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URLs, or obfuscated code. Use of standard libraries and straightforward methods. No signs of hidden backdoors or malicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom form fields for file and image uploads with associated widgets, handling upload, deletion, and display logic. It correctly manages file streams and filenames via the provided FileManager and ImageManager classes, avoiding any code injection or unsafe handling. No malicious payloads or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code follows typical Flask-WTForms extension patterns and securely processes file uploads, with validation for allowed file types. There are no indications of covert data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. The overall structure is standard and maintains security best practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of file upload fields in Flask with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It effectively handles file operations and user interactions as intended without including harmful code or data leakage mechanisms.",
