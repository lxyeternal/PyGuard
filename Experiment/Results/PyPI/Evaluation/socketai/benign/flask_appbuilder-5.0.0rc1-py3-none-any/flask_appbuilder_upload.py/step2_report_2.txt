  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides custom Flask-WTForms fields and widgets for file/image uploads, handling upload, deletion, and display. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Findings:** The report correctly notes that the code uses standard libraries, external managers, and straightforward logic. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration. Validation for allowed file types is in place.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.2 (low). These seem reasonable given the analysis.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment appears accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on standard patterns, validation, and reliance on external managers. No suspicious activity.\n\n- **Findings:** Correctly identifies that the code is standard, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only caveat is the dependency on external classes, but nothing suspicious is indicated.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.2. These are appropriate.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Valid and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard implementation of file/image upload fields, with validation and handling via external managers. No malicious code or network activity.\n\n- **Findings:** The report correctly notes that the code follows typical patterns, with no signs of covert activity or malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.2. Appropriate.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, focusing on standard patterns, validation, and external managers. No malicious activity.\n\n- **Findings:** Correctly notes that the code is standard, with no suspicious code or behaviors. The reliance on external managers is typical, and no hidden malicious code is evident.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.2. Reasonable.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard Flask form fields for file/image uploads, with delete and store logic, no signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Findings:** The analysis is consistent; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity. The code is typical for web file uploads.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.2. Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis. No malicious payloads or behaviors are detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n\n- **Security Risk Score:** 0.2 across all reports indicates low risk, which is reasonable given the code's nature and the absence of suspicious activities.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n\n- The code relies on external classes (`FileManager`, `ImageManager`) for file operations. If these classes contain malicious code, the risk could be higher. However, based solely on this code, no such issues are evident.\n\n- The code handles user input carefully, with validation and deletion mechanisms, following best practices.\n\n- No signs of obfuscation, hidden backdoors, or malicious network activity.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Scores:** Keep the malware and obfuscated scores at 0.0, and the security risk at 0.2, reflecting low but non-zero risk due to external dependencies.\n\n- **Potential for higher risk:** Only if the external `FileManager` or `ImageManager` classes are compromised, which cannot be assessed here.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\n- The code appears secure, well-structured, and free of malicious behavior.\n\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n- No changes are necessary based on this review.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (consistent with the reports)  \n\nThis reflects a low-risk, straightforward implementation with no signs of malicious activity.",
