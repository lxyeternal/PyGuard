  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as defining custom exception classes for various application errors.\n- No external data processing, input reading, or network activity is involved.\n- The code is straightforward, with standard inheritance, exception chaining, and string representations.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated patterns are detected.\n- The use of `...` in some classes indicates placeholders or incomplete implementations but does not imply malicious intent.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code matches the descriptions; no issues are present.\n   - No vulnerabilities, malware, or obfuscation are evident.\n   - The exception classes are standard and serve typical error handling purposes.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as safe, standard, and non-malicious.\n   - No logical errors or reasoning flaws are apparent.\n   - The reports appropriately dismiss concerns about obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n\n3. **Scores given to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n   - The confidence scores are 1, reflecting certainty about the analysis.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores seem reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all scores are 0 for malware and security risk, no justification is needed.\n   - The code is purely structural, with no active or malicious components.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - No malicious activity is present; the malware score remains 0.\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as harmless.\n   - The use of `...` is recognized as a placeholder, not malicious code.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\nGiven the detailed review, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is standard, safe, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Estimated Value |\n|------------------|-----------------|\n| Malware          | 0               |\n| Obfuscated       | 0               |\n| Security Risk    | 0               |\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a typical set of custom exception class definitions, safe for use in a larger application, with no indications of supply chain risks or malicious intent.",
