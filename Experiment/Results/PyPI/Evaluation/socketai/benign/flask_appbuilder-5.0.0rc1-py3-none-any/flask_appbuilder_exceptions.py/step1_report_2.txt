{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific errors in a system, likely related to database operations, filtering, authentication, and OAuth providers.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; exception classes do not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; exception classes do not perform operations that handle untrusted data or cause side effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; class definitions do not process external data.",
  "anomalies": "None observed; code consists solely of class definitions with standard inheritance and no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes inheriting from a base exception. Each class is straightforward, with no external data input, no execution of code based on untrusted data, and no operations that could lead to security issues. The use of 'Optional[Exception]' as a constructor parameter is standard for exception chaining. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code appears to be purely structural, supporting error handling within an application. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of well-structured exception classes intended for error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears safe and standard for its purpose.",
