{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for a system, particularly related to database, filtering, OAuth, login, and password validation errors.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; all classes and exception definitions are static code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no execution of external commands, network activity, or data processing occurs.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; the code only defines exception classes with no dynamic execution or data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs present. The class definitions are standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from a base exception. These are typical for application error handling and do not perform any input/output, network, or system operations. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious code logic. No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is purely structural, defining custom exception classes with no malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and standard for a Python project handling errors related to database, filters, OAuth, and login functionalities.",
