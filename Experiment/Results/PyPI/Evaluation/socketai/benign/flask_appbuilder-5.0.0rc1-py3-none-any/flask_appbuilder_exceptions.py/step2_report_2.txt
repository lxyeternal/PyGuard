  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code only defines custom exception classes inheriting from Exception and a base class FABException.\n   - No input/output processing, external data handling, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The `__str__` method in FABException provides a clear string representation, which is standard.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that the code is purely structural, with no malicious or security-sensitive operations.\n   - They correctly note the use of `...` in some classes as placeholders, which is common and not suspicious.\n   - No logical errors or misconceptions are evident in the analysis.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n   - The confidence scores are 1, indicating high certainty.\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious content.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports assign a security risk of 0, and the code shows no malicious or risky behavior, there's no justification for higher scores.\n   - The code is standard exception class definitions, which are safe.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n   - No malicious behavior, payload, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that the code is purely structural and safe.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is straightforward, standard Python exception class definitions.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-sensitive aspects are present.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**My Final Estimate:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is safe, standard, and intended for error handling within an application. No changes to the scores are necessary.",
