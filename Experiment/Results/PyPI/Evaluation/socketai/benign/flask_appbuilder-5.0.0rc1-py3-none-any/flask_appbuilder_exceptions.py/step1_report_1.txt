{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for a Python application, primarily related to database operations, authentication, and filtering.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads input or external data; it solely defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involved; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input to critical operations; these are class definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated code present. The code structure and naming are standard and clear.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of custom exception class definitions inheriting from Exception and a base class FABException. No input reading, data processing, or external calls are present. The __str__ method in FABException provides custom string representation. No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected. The code appears straightforward and standard for exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely defines custom exception classes for use within a larger application. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The code is safe and standard for exception handling purposes.",
