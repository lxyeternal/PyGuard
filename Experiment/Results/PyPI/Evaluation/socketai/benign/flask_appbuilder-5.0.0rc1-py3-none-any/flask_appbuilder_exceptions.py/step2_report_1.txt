  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions. There are no input reads, external data processing, or dynamic behaviors. The classes are straightforward, inherit from Exception, and include a custom __str__ method. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning**:  \n   The reports correctly identify that the code is purely structural and does not perform any operations that could pose security risks. They note the use of `...` in some classes as placeholders, which is standard and not malicious. The reasoning appears sound and consistent.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the analysis. Since no malicious activity or obfuscation is detected, these scores seem reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   The risk scores are all 0, justified by the absence of any suspicious or malicious behavior. The code is purely for exception handling, which is safe.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the lack of any malicious patterns.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on the code's static analysis, which is appropriate.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, standard exception class definitions with no security risks or malicious intent.**  \nIt is a typical pattern in Python applications to define custom exceptions for better error handling.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThe reports are accurate, and no changes are necessary. The code is safe, and the scores reflect that accurately.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate after this review**:  \n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the existing assessments.",
