  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports confirm that the code is purely defining custom exception classes.\n- No external data input, data processing, or output handling occurs.\n- No suspicious or malicious code patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present.\n- The code structure is standard, with exception inheritance, optional exception chaining, and descriptive string methods.\n- The use of `...` in some classes indicates placeholders or incomplete implementation but does not suggest malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Specific review per report:\n\n**Report 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5:**\n- **Purpose:** All focus on defining exception classes related to database, filtering, OAuth, login, password validation, etc.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** No data sources or sinks involved.\n- **Flows:** No runtime data flow involving untrusted input.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected; standard class definitions.\n- **Analysis:** The code is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is safe, standard, and intended solely for error handling.\n\n---\n\n### Malware and Obfuscation Scores:\n- All reports assign malware = 0 and obfuscated = 0, which is consistent with the analysis.\n- The code is very transparent, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads.\n\n### Security Risks:\n- All reports assign securityRisk = 0, which aligns with the absence of any security concerns.\n\n### Scoring justification:\n- Since all reports agree on the benign nature of the code, and there's no evidence to suggest otherwise, I concur with their assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Additional comments:\n- The only minor note is the use of `...` in some classes, which indicates placeholders or incomplete implementation, but this is common in abstract classes or stubs and not malicious.\n- The overall structure and content are typical for exception handling modules.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is a standard, safe, and non-malicious set of exception class definitions with no security issues.",
