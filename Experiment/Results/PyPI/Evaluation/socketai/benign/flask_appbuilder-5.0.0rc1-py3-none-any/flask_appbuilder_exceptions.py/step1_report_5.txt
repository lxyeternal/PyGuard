{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for a larger application, primarily related to database operations, validation, and authentication errors.",
  "sources": "No input or external data sources are read; the code solely defines classes and their behaviors.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows leading to data leaks, external calls, or sensitive operations; the code only manages exception classes.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks, as the code does not process untrusted data or perform operations with external side effects.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors; the code is straightforward class definitions with proper exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from a base exception, with optional exception chaining and descriptive string representations. All classes are standard, with no external data handling, network calls, or security-sensitive operations. No obfuscation or malicious constructs are present. The code appears to be part of a larger application for error handling and does not exhibit malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of standard exception class definitions with no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and typical for a Python application managing errors related to database and validation operations.",
