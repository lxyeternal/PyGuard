  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for application error handling, including database, filtering, OAuth, login, and password validation errors.",
  "sources": "No data sources; the code only defines classes without input reading or external data processing.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the classes are static definitions with no runtime data movement.",
  "anomalies": "Use of '...' in some classes indicates placeholders or incomplete implementation, but this is standard for abstract or base classes.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from Exception, with a custom __str__ method. There are no dynamic behaviors, external data handling, or malicious patterns. The structure is straightforward and typical for error handling modules. No suspicious or malicious activity is detected. The use of '...' is common in abstract classes and does not imply malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard exception class definitions with no security risks or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the code as safe, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
