{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for a larger application, primarily related to database operations, filtering, password validation, OAuth, and login attempts.",
  "sources": "Code imports from 'typing' for Optional; class definitions that do not read external input.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive operations or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of `...` (ellipsis) in class bodies for some exceptions, which is common in placeholder or abstract class definitions. No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The exception handling pattern is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from Python's built-in Exception and a base custom class FABException. The classes include constructors and string representations, with no external input processing, network communication, or data manipulation. The use of `Optional[Exception]` in FABException allows chaining exceptions but does not introduce security risks. The placeholder `...` in some classes indicates incomplete implementation but does not suggest malicious intent. Overall, the code is straightforward, structured, and intended for error handling in an application context. No malicious behaviors, security risks, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of well-structured custom exception classes with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger application’s error handling framework. There are no indicators of supply chain attacks or malicious intent.",
