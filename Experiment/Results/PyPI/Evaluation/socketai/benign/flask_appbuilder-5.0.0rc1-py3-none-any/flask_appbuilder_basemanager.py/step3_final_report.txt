  "purpose": "A base class for managing views and processing hooks within an application framework.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameter 'appbuilder' assigned to an instance variable.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, external calls, or sensitive operations present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'appbuilder' parameter to the class attribute; no external data flow or dynamic execution observed.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; code is straightforward, with placeholder methods and no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple, benign base class intended for extension. It contains no dynamic code execution, external data fetches, network activity, or cryptographic operations. The class is a scaffold with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All methods are placeholders, and the class serves as a structural component within a larger application. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless base class with no malicious or security concerns. The scores and assessments are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
