{
  "purpose": "This code defines an ActionItem class and a decorator function to expose actions with metadata.",
  "sources": "No input sources; the code defines classes and functions without external data reading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data output, storage, or network transmission is present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code mainly sets attributes and attaches metadata to functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior detected. The __repr__ method uses string formatting but does not pose a security risk.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a class for representing actions with various attributes and a decorator for attaching metadata to functions. There are no external data inputs, network operations, or insecure code patterns. The functions are straightforward, and no obfuscated or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of action handling with metadata decoration. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
