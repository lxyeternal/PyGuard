  "purpose": "Defines an ActionItem class for representing actions with metadata and a decorator to attach metadata to functions for registration or UI purposes.",
  "sources": "Class attributes (name, text, confirmation, icon, multiple, single, func); decorator attaching metadata to functions via _action attribute.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Decorator attaches metadata to functions; ActionItem stores references and attributes; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple class for action representation and a decorator for attaching metadata to functions. It involves no external data input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The use of string formatting in __repr__ is safe. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The code is a standard pattern for action registration, with no security concerns or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and free from malicious or obfuscated constructs. The existing scores are appropriate and should not be changed.",
