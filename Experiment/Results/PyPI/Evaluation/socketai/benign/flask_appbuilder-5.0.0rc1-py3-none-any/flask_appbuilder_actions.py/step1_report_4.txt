  "purpose": "Define an ActionItem class and a decorator function for exposing actions with metadata in a Python application.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to the ActionItem constructor, decorator parameters, and the __repr__ method",
  "sinks": "None identified; code primarily defines data structures and a decorator without executing untrusted data",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class and a decorator for handling actions, primarily for use in a larger application framework. It does not process external inputs or perform any I/O operations. The class stores attributes, and the decorator attaches metadata to functions. There are no indications of malicious behavior, code injection, or security risks. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or credential handling are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a class and a decorator used for UI actions or similar features. It does not contain malicious code or security issues. It appears safe and typical for application code that manages actions and their metadata.",
