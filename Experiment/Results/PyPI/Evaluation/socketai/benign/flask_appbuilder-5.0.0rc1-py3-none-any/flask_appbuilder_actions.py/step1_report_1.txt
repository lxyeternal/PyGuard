  "purpose": "Define an ActionItem class and a decorator to expose actions, likely for use in a UI or workflow context.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to __init__ method, decorator parameters, and the function passed to the decorator.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to class attributes, setting function attribute _action.",
  "flows": "Inputs to __init__ -> creation of ActionItem object; decorator parameters and function -> setting _action attribute.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed. No obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple class to store action properties and a decorator to attach metadata to functions. No external data inputs, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of an action registry pattern with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
