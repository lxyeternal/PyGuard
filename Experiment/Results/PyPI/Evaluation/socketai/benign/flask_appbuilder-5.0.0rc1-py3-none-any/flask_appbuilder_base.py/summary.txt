  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate framework component with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. The primary risk stems from dynamic class import based on external inputs, which could be exploited if class paths are untrusted. Proper validation of class_path inputs is recommended. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting the inherent risk in dynamic imports but considering the safeguards in place."
