  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** The code is only import statements with no dynamic or external data handling. No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are detected.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent; no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the lack of dynamic execution or suspicious patterns. Slightly higher securityRisk (0.1), but justified given the minimal code.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.  \n- **Assessment:** Acceptable; no malicious intent.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Again, straightforward import statements with no signs of malicious behavior. No obfuscation or malware.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as above, standard package setup code.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar import structure, no suspicious activity. Slightly higher securityRisk (0.1), but justified.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.  \n- **Assessment:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward import statements.\n- **Risk Score:** Mostly 0, with two reports (2 and 5) assigning 0.1, which seems reasonable considering the code is purely import statements with no dynamic or external data handling.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a standard module setup with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The small securityRisk score (0.1) in some reports seems justified as a precaution, possibly reflecting the minimal risk associated with import statements in a larger codebase, but not indicating any real threat.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (small, justifiable security consideration for module imports)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. No changes needed to the scores. The code is benign and typical for a Python package's import setup.",
