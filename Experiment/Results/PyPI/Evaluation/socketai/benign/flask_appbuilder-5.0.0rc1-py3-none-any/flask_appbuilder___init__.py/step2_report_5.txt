  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the evidence, scores, and underlying assumptions.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code is just import statements with no data handling or dynamic execution.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No sinks or data flows; purely static imports.\n- **Anomalies:** None observed; standard pattern.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, malware, or security risk detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above, import statements from internal modules.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No evidence of data output or external communication.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity or security risk.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n  - **Question:** A security risk score of 0.1 suggests minimal concern. Given the code is just imports, this seems slightly high but not unreasonable if the framework is complex.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n\n**Assessment:** The low security risk score seems acceptable; no malicious activity is indicated.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Imports various components related to views, models, security, API.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** None observed.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard module import pattern; no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Imports for package setup.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data handling or execution.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical package initialization code; no security concerns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar import setup for a web framework.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flows or execution points.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard module import code; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n  - **Question:** Again, a minimal security risk score. Since no dynamic code or external data, this is acceptable.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with straightforward import statements.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports, which is reasonable given the context; the code is static and benign.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, based on the package's role; no active security issues.\n\n**Note:** The scores are consistent with the code's nature. The minimal security risk score reflects the package's role as an import setup, not executing untrusted code or handling sensitive data.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified based on the provided snippets.",
