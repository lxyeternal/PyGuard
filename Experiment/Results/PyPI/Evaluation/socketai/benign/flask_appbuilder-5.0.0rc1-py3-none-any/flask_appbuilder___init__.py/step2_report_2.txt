  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The report correctly identifies that the code is just import statements with metadata, no data handling or execution.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data sinks or flows, no dynamic code execution.\n- **Anomalies:** None observed.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate; the code is standard module setup with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, standard imports.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data sinks or flows.\n- **Anomalies:** None observed.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — the securityRisk is minimal, but since no issues are found, it could be lowered to 0 for consistency.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Imports components related to views, models, security, typical for web apps.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No actual data handling or execution.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Valid; purely import statements.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard package setup.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flow or execution.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — suitable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Importing various components for a web framework.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flow or execution.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Valid.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — again, minimal, but since no issues are present, could be lowered to 0.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is just import statements with no malicious activity.\n- The malware scores are appropriately zero.\n- The obfuscated scores are zero, as no obfuscation is present.\n- The security risk scores are very low, which is justified given the code's nature.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The securityRisk scores in reports 2 and 5 could be adjusted downward to 0, as there's no evidence of any security concern.\n- The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly assigned as 0 across all reports.\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (or possibly 0.1 if the slight default in some reports is kept for conservatism)\n\nThis code fragment is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
