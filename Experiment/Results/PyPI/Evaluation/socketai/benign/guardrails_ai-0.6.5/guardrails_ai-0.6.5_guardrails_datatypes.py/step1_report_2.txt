  "purpose": "Defines a list of string values by combining members from SimpleTypes and RailTypes enumerations for use in validation or configuration.",
  "sources": "Imports from guardrails_api_client, guardrails.types.rail, and enumeration members SimpleTypes and RailTypes.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or output sensitive information.",
  "flows": "Imports → Enumeration member extraction → List concatenation",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific types and creates a list by unpacking enumeration member values. It combines two enumerations into a single list for later use, likely for validation or configuration. No dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no data leakage are present. All operations are straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign enumeration list construction with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
