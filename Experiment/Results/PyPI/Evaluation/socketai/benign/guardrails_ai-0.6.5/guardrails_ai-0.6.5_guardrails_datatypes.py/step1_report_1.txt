{
  "purpose": "Define a list of string types by combining values from imported enums SimpleTypes and RailTypes.",
  "sources": "Import statements from guardrails_api_client and guardrails.types.rail, and list comprehension accessing enum values.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Imports are read, followed by list comprehension that accesses enum values, which are then stored in a list.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. The code uses standard enum value extraction.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two modules containing enums, then constructs a list by unpacking enum values from SimpleTypes and RailTypes. The operations are straightforward and involve only reading enum values, with no data being sent, written to files, or used in insecure operations. No obfuscation, malicious code, or anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module setting up a list of string types from enums, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
