  "purpose": "Define a list of string values by extracting 'value' attributes from two enumerations, SimpleTypes and RailTypes.",
  "sources": "Accessing 'value' attributes of enumeration members in SimpleTypes and RailTypes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Enumeration member values are read from SimpleTypes and RailTypes, then concatenated into a list.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; the code is straightforward and typical for enum value collection.",
  "analysis": "The code imports typing.List and two modules containing enumerations. It constructs a list 'types_registry' by unpacking list comprehensions that extract 'value' attributes from enum members. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic. The code solely collects enum values for likely later use, with no external data sources, sinks, or data flows indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving to gather enumeration values into a list without any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
