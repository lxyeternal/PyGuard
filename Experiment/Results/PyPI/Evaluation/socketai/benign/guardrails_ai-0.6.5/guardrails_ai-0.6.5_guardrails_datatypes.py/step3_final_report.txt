  "purpose": "Aggregate enum values from guardrails_api_client.SimpleTypes and guardrails.types.rail.RailTypes into a list for validation or configuration purposes.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'value' attribute from each enum member in SimpleTypes and RailTypes.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external communication.",
  "flows": "Enum member values are unpacked and combined into a list; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward enum value collection with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two enum classes and constructs a list by unpacking their 'value' attributes. It involves only static data access without dynamic execution, external communication, or data sinks. No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious behavior are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with high confidence, and assign zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The code's simplicity and purpose are clear, and no vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward collection of enum values with no malicious or security concerns. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
