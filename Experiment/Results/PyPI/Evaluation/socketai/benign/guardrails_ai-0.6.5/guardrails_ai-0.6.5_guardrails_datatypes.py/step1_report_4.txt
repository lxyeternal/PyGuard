  "purpose": "Define a list of string types by aggregating values from two enums/classes.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'SimpleTypes' and 'RailTypes', list comprehensions accessing 'value' attributes.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks; the code simply creates a list from enum values.",
  "flows": "The list 'types_registry' is populated directly from enum values, with no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports enum-like classes and constructs a list by unpacking their 'value' attributes. The use of list comprehensions appears standard, converting enum members to strings. No external data input, network operations, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and standard for defining a collection of constants.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and standard for aggregating enum values into a list. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
