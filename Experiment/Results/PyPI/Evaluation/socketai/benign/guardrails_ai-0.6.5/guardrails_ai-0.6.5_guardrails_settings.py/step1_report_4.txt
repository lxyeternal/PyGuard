{
  "purpose": "Defines a singleton Settings class to manage configuration options for Guardrails, including server usage, tracing, and an RC object.",
  "sources": "Loading RC object via RC.load() in _initialize() and rc property getter; reading class variables.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data outputs present in this code.",
  "flows": "RC.load() may load data from external sources, but details are not shown; no explicit flow to external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. Use of threading.Lock for singleton pattern is standard. No obfuscation or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a singleton pattern with thread safety for configuration settings. It loads an RC object during initialization, which could potentially load external data, but no specifics are provided. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. No risky operations, unsafe code, or suspicious data flows are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard configuration management class with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply manages settings and loads an RC object without engaging in insecure operations.",
