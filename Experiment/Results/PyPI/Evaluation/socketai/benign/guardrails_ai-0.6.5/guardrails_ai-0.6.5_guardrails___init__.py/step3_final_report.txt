{
  "purpose": "This __init__.py file serves to organize and expose the public API of the 'guardrails' package by importing key classes, functions, and constants for external use.",
  "sources": "Static imports from internal modules within the 'guardrails' package, including classes, functions, and constants.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, user inputs, or external communications are present; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules and assigns them to the __all__ list, establishing a static source-to-export flow without dynamic or runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The only notable anomaly is the comment '# FIXME: Why is this being exported?' next to 'PromptCallableBase', indicating developer uncertainty but not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package initializer that imports various modules and defines __all__ for public API exposure. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling. The comment about 'PromptCallableBase' suggests a potential review point but does not indicate malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static package setup file with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
