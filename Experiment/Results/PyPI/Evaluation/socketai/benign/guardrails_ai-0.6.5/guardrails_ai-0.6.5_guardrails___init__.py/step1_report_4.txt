{
  "purpose": "This __init__.py file is designed to set up package exports for the 'guardrails' module, allowing users to import specific classes and functions directly from the package.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from the package's internal modules and exports specific classes, functions, and variables defined in those modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or potentially exploited. The code only exports symbols for external use.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present that could lead from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks. The code simply imports and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "The line exporting 'PromptCallableBase' is marked with a FIXME comment questioning its purpose, which suggests some uncertainty about its inclusion, but this is not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module initializer (__init__.py) that imports and re-exports specific classes and functions for external use. The presence of a FIXME comment indicates developer note-taking but does not imply malicious intent. The structure and content are typical for package setup files. No suspicious code patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code does not perform any input/output operations, network connections, or data processing that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign package setup script intended for organizing exports. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks within this file.",
