{
  "purpose": "To set up __init__.py for the 'guardrails' package, allowing specific modules and classes to be imported directly from the package.",
  "sources": "Static import statements at the beginning of the file, referencing various modules and classes within the 'guardrails' package.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no use of untrusted input, environment variables, or network operations.",
  "flows": "The import statements define module exports; no runtime data flow or processing is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The comment 'FIXME: Why is this being exported?' indicates a potential question about code clarity but no malicious intent. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code only consists of import statements and an __all__ declaration, which are standard for module exports. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, data manipulation, or other suspicious activity. The comment suggests a potential area of code review or clarification but does not imply malicious behavior. Overall, the code appears to serve as a simple module initializer with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard __init__.py setup for the 'guardrails' package, exposing specific classes and functions for public use. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code.",
