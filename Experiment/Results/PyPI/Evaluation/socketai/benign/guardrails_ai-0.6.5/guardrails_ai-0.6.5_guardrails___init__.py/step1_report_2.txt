{
  "purpose": "This code sets up the __init__.py for the 'guardrails' package, enabling simplified imports for users.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from various modules within the 'guardrails' package.",
  "targets": "Exports of classes, functions, and constants for external use.",
  "flows": "Import statements (sources) do not process untrusted data; __all__ list defines public API, no data flow to external input.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and the __all__ export list. All imported modules and attributes appear to be standard and intended for package API setup. There are no signs of data leakage, malicious code, or unusual behavior. The comment about 'PromptCallableBase' indicates a possible curiosity or placeholder but not malicious activity. No dynamic execution, network calls, or sensitive data handling present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical __init__.py setup file for a Python package, designed to facilitate user imports. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements.",
