  "purpose": "This code sets up the __init__.py module for the 'guardrails' package, enabling simplified imports for users.",
  "sources": "The code imports classes, functions, and variables from various modules within the 'guardrails' package.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sources or sinks present; the code only performs static imports and __all__ exports.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing internal modules and then exposing selected components via __all__ for external use.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are present. The comment about 'PromptCallableBase' being exported appears to be a note or concern but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward __init__.py file that consolidates imports for easier package usage. It does not process or handle external data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. The comment regarding 'PromptCallableBase' suggests an awareness or potential concern about that export, but it does not affect security. No signs of obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious intent are detected. The code strictly manages module exports.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package initialization file that facilitates user imports. There are no security issues, malicious behaviors, or anomalies detected. The comment about 'PromptCallableBase' does not indicate malicious intent but may suggest a future review or concern.",
