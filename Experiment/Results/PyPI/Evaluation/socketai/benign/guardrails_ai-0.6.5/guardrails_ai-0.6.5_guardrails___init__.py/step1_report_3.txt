{
  "purpose": "This code sets up the __init__.py for the 'guardrails' package, enabling users to import various classes, functions, and constants directly from the package.",
  "sources": "Imports from various modules within the 'guardrails' package, such as guard, async_guard, llm_providers, logging_utils, prompt, utils, on_fail, validator_base, settings, hub.install, validation_outcome, and prompt_utils.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, user input, or external data handling present. No data leakage or external communication is performed in this code.",
  "flows": "The code simply imports modules and exports selected symbols; there are no data flows, source-to-sink pathways, or dynamic code execution involved.",
  "anomalies": "The only notable comment is the FIXME regarding the export of 'PromptCallableBase', which indicates awareness of a potential issue or deliberate choice. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward and standard for setting up package exports. It imports modules and defines __all__ for public API exposure. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no data handling, or external network interactions. The comment suggests an open question about 'PromptCallableBase' but does not imply malicious intent. No anomalies or suspicious code are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This __init__.py code is a standard package setup file with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It functions solely to expose module components for external use.",
