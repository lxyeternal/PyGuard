  "purpose": "Implement a three-way text merge using diff_match_patch, resolving conflicts based on diff analysis.",
  "sources": "Input strings: source, target, base; diff computations via diff_match_patch.diff_main.",
  "sinks": "None; the code operates solely on string data without external system interactions.",
  "flows": "Diff computations from base to source/target; conflict resolution and appending to composed_text; final join to produce merged output.",
  "anomalies": "Complex nested control flow, commented conflict markers, but no malicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, complex implementation of a three-way merge using diff_match_patch. It handles various diff cases, including additions, deletions, and conflicts, with detailed logic for conflict resolution. No external calls, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The control flow, while intricate, is typical for such merge algorithms. No signs of malicious behavior or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, non-malicious implementation of a three-way merge algorithm. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The complexity is justified by the merge logic, and the code operates solely on string data without external interactions.",
