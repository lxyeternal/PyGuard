  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured implementation for embedding generation with external API support. No malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to external API interactions and credential management, which are handled appropriately via parameters. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting cautious handling of API credentials. Overall, the supply chain security posture of this code is sound."
