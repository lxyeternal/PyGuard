The scores of zero for malware and obfuscation are correct; the low risk score is justified but could be set to zero for maximum conservatism. Overall, the code is safe, and the reports accurately reflect this."

The security risk is minimal, primarily related to external API interactions and credential management, which are handled appropriately via parameters. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting cautious handling of API credentials. Overall, the supply chain security posture of this code is sound."
