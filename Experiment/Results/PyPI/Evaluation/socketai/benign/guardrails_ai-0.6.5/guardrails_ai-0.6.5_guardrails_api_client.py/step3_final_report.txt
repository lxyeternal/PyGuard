{
  "purpose": "A Python client class for interacting with the Guardrails API, handling guard management, validation, streaming validation, and history retrieval.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for API URLs and keys; API request parameters; JSON payloads from method inputs.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request headers (including API keys); JSON responses processed in streaming and non-streaming methods.",
  "flows": "Method calls to API endpoints with payloads; response data parsed and yielded or returned; error handling pathways.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API client using standard libraries and practices. It fetches configuration from environment variables, performs HTTP requests with proper error handling, and processes JSON responses, including streaming data. No malicious or suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or supply chain attack vectors are evident. The use of environment variables for sensitive data is typical but always requires secure handling outside the code. The network interactions are standard and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured API client with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage. It handles configuration and network communication securely and transparently. The security risk and malware scores are appropriately low, and the overall assessment confirms the code's safety.",
