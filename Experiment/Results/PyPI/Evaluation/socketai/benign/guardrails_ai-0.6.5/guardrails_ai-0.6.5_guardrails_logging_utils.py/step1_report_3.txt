{
  "purpose": "Configure logging settings using functions from the guardrails.logger module.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'logging_config' and 'log_level' that can accept external input.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; the functions 'set_config' and 'set_level' are invoked with parameters, but their internal behavior is unknown.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are passed directly to 'set_config' and 'set_level' functions, potentially influencing logging behavior.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward; no suspicious or unusual code constructs, no hardcoded secrets or backdoors. The TODO comment indicates planned feature enhancement but is benign.",
  "analysis": "The script imports two functions for setting logging configuration and defines a function to configure logging by passing parameters to these functions. Since the actual behavior depends on external functions, there is no evident malicious activity. The code does not handle sensitive data directly nor does it perform any dangerous operations. The only consideration is that parameters can influence logging behavior, but this is standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple logging configuration wrapper with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on external functions whose implementation details are unknown but are likely safe given context. No malicious intent or vulnerabilities are detected.",
