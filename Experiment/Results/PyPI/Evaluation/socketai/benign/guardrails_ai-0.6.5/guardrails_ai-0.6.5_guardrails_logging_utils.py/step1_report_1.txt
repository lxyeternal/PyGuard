  "purpose": "Configure logging settings for the application using external guardrails.logger functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input data; it uses function parameters which are potentially controlled externally.",
  "sinks": "The code calls external functions set_config and set_level which may handle or process configuration data; if these functions process untrusted input, potential risks could arise.",
  "flows": "Parameters logging_config and log_level flow into set_config and set_level functions respectively, which could process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a TODO comment indicating future support for a log sink, but currently, there are no anomalies or suspicious code behaviors. The code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two functions from an external module and defines a simple configuration function that passes parameters to these functions. There are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. The parameters are potentially externally supplied, but without further context, this does not constitute malicious activity. The TODO comment suggests planned enhancement but does not currently introduce risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard logging configuration wrapper with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It relies on external functions whose implementation could affect security, but based solely on this snippet, no malicious activity is detected.",
