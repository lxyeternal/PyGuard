  "purpose": "Configure logging settings for an application using functions from the guardrails.logger module.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to set_config and set_level functions, which are called with logging_config and log_level respectively.",
  "sinks": "The functions set_config and set_level may process or store logging configurations; no external data processing or untrusted input flows are evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> set_config/set_level functions -> logging configuration application",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns observed; no hardcoded credentials or malicious behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The code simply defines a function that calls two imported functions to set logging configurations. There is no evidence of data leaks, code injection, or malicious intent. The comments suggest future support for log sinks, but no such functionality is implemented here. The code is straightforward and appears legitimate for configuring logging.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard logging configuration snippet with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is simple and intended solely for setting up logging parameters.",
