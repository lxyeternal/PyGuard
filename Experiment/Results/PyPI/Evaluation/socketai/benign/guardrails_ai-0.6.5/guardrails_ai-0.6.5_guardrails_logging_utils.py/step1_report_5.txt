  "purpose": "Configure logging settings for an application using guardrails.logger functions.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to the function 'configure_logging' (logging_config, log_level).",
  "sinks": "None present in the provided code snippet; no untrusted data is being written to external systems.",
  "flows": "Parameters are passed to 'set_config' and 'set_level' functions without further processing; no data flow to external sinks identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior. The comment suggests potential future expansion but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports logging configuration functions from 'guardrails.logger' and defines a function to set configurations and log levels. It accepts optional parameters and calls external functions accordingly. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious code. The comment indicates planned features but does not introduce any security concerns. The code is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple, benign logging configuration helper. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected. It is well-structured and clear, with no signs of obfuscation or malware.",
