  "purpose": "Configure logging settings using functions from the guardrails.logger module.",
  "sources": "Functions called: set_config and set_level imported from guardrails.logger.",
  "targets": "These functions are used to set logging configurations and levels, which could potentially influence logging behavior.",
  "flows": "Calls to set_config and set_level receive parameters (logging_config, log_level) that determine logging behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code present. The comment indicates an enhancement for logging sinks but is not implemented, which is normal development activity.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two functions for logging configuration and defines a function to set these configurations. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are used within this snippet. The functions are called with parameters that are defaults (None), indicating optional configuration. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns are evident. The comment suggests future enhancement but does not introduce risk. The code itself appears straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple logging configuration utility with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It uses standard patterns and does not include any suspicious or malicious code elements.",
