  "purpose": "Configure logging settings by passing provided configurations and log level to external functions.",
  "sources": "External functions set_config and set_level from guardrails.logger, called with parameters logging_config and log_level.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input directly, only passes parameters to external functions.",
  "flows": "Parameters logging_config and log_level flow into external functions set_config and set_level without further processing.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a TODO comment indicating future feature support; no current anomalies or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward wrapper around external logging configuration functions, accepting optional parameters and passing them directly. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are present. The parameters could influence external functions' behavior, but with no evidence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities in this snippet. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.2) are appropriate, though a risk score of 0 is more justified given the benign nature. External functions' internal handling remains unknown, but based solely on this code, the security posture is minimal risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal logging configuration wrapper with no malicious activity or security issues detected. The scores of zero for malware and obfuscation are correct; the low risk score is justified but could be set to zero for maximum conservatism. Overall, the code is safe, and the reports accurately reflect this.",
