{
  "purpose": "This code provides utilities for working with ONNX models, including graph traversal, shape modification, opset updates, model optimization, and dependency mapping.",
  "sources": "File input via onnx.load() and onnx.shape_inference.infer_shapes(); model file paths provided as function arguments.",
  "sinks": "Model files saved via onnx.save(); potentially large models handled with external data files; no direct untrusted data outputs observed.",
  "flows": "Input file paths are loaded into ONNX models, then processed through various functions for shape modification, optimization, or updates, with models saved back to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or backdoors. Use of standard ONNX APIs and no hidden network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly handles ONNX models for graph traversal, shape fixing, opset updates, and optimization. It uses public ONNX and ONNX Runtime APIs. No code injection, data leakage, or network communication functionalities are present. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors detected. The code's structure is straightforward, primarily data processing and model file management. The shape inference fallback for large models is a known ONNX pattern, not malicious. There are no indicators of sabotage or malware within this implementation.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs legitimate model manipulation tasks with no malicious intent or security risks. It adheres to standard practices for ONNX model processing, with no suspicious or malicious behaviors detected.",
