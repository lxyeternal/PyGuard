{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for ONNX model processing, including graph traversal, shape inference, opset updates, optimization, and dependency mapping.",
  "sources": "Model files loaded via onnx.load, model attributes, graph inputs, initializers, and node attributes.",
  "sinks": "Saving updated models to disk, writing external data files, temporary files during shape inference, and logging outputs.",
  "flows": "Model loading -> graph traversal and modification -> shape inference and fixing -> model saving or updating.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no network activity, and no obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard ONNX and ONNX Runtime APIs for model manipulation, including graph traversal, shape inference, opset updates, and optimization. Temporary files are handled cautiously for large models. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The functions perform legitimate tasks with proper resource management. The security implications are minimal, with potential risks limited to misuse of utilities, which are standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility suite for ONNX model processing. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The low risk score is justified by standard practices and the absence of suspicious activity.",
