  "purpose": "The script is a model conversion utility that converts ONNX models to ORT format, applying optional optimizations and generating configuration files for minimal build processes.",
  "sources": "Reads ONNX model files from specified directory or file paths, environment variable for optimization level, and user inputs for model paths and options.",
  "sinks": "Creates optimized ONNX and ORT format model files, configuration files, and loads models into onnxruntime inference sessions for conversion.",
  "flows": "Reads model files -> applies optimizations based on environment variables and user options -> saves models and configuration files -> loads models into inference sessions for conversion.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no network activity, no obfuscation or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file handling, model loading, optimization, and saving operations using onnxruntime and standard libraries. It handles model files securely, applies environment configurations, and manages exceptions appropriately. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage are present. The logic is straightforward, with clear separation of concerns and no suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured ONNX to ORT model conversion utility with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The low malware score (0), zero obfuscation (0), and low security risk (0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the observed behavior.",
