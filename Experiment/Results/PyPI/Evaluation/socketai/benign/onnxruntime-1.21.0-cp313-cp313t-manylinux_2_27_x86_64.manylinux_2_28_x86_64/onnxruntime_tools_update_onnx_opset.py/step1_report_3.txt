  "purpose": "The script updates the ONNX model's opset version to a specified value, defaulting to 15.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments for input model path, output model path, and optional opset value.",
  "sinks": "Calls the function 'update_onnx_opset' with the provided paths and opset value, which may process or modify the ONNX model file.",
  "flows": "User provides input model path -> script calls 'update_onnx_opset' with input path, opset, and output path -> model file may be read and rewritten.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or hidden behaviors; straightforward argument parsing and function call. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI utility that updates an ONNX model file to a newer opset version. It uses argparse for input validation and relies on an imported utility function. No network activity, no data leakage, and no suspicious logic are present. It processes files based on user input, which is standard behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This script appears to be a legitimate utility for updating ONNX models. No malware or malicious intent is evident. It is a straightforward implementation with no security concerns based on the provided code.",
