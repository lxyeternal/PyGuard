  "purpose": "A command-line utility to update the ONNX model's opset version, delegating core functionality to an external function.",
  "sources": "User input paths for input and output models, and optional opset version argument.",
  "sinks": "The external function 'update_onnx_opset' which processes the model; no other data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Input paths and opset parameter flow into 'update_onnx_opset', which processes the model file.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper that parses arguments and calls an external utility to update an ONNX model's opset. It contains no network activity, data leaks, or malicious logic. The external function's safety is assumed but not verified. The code structure and logic are standard and benign, with no anomalies or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1) are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The external 'update_onnx_opset' function's safety should be verified separately, but based solely on this code, it is safe. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
