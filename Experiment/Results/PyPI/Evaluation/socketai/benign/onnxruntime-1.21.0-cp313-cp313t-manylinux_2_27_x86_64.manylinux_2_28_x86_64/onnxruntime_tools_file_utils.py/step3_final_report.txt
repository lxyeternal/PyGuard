  "purpose": "Utility functions for filesystem path matching and file retrieval with filtering.",
  "sources": "Filesystem paths provided by user input, functions operating on pathlib.Path or str.",
  "sinks": "None; no data leaks, network activity, or external data processing present.",
  "flows": "Input paths are processed to match suffixes or retrieve files; no external data flows or untrusted data effects.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard filesystem operations: string case-insensitive suffix matching and directory traversal with filtering. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security flaws are present. The functions accept user input but do not process untrusted data in a harmful way. No network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. The code is straightforward, using standard library functions, and is typical for utility modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward utility functions with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. No adjustments are necessary.",
