{
  "purpose": "The script provides command-line tools for extracting, embedding, merging, and pretty-printing tuning results within ONNX model files, mainly for model optimization workflows.",
  "sources": "Reads ONNX model files, JSON files containing tuning results, and command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Outputs JSON files, modified ONNX models, and printed information to stdout/stderr.",
  "flows": "Reads model and tuning results from files (sources) -> processes data (merging, embedding, extracting) -> outputs results to files or console.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'assert' statements for control flow; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data handling; code appears to be standard data processing without hidden or unusual behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily for managing tuning results within ONNX models, involving file I/O, JSON serialization/deserialization, and in-memory data manipulation. No network activity, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious code patterns. Usage of 'assert' statements is a benign form of runtime check, not malicious. The script does not contain obfuscated code, malware signatures, or unusual system calls. It follows typical command-line tool structure with argument parsing and standard data processing routines. The absence of external network connections, environment variable manipulations, or data exfiltration mechanisms suggests no malicious intent. Overall, the code is straightforward and appears safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for handling tuning results in ONNX models. No indicators of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are present. The design and implementation are consistent with a legitimate model management tool.",
