{
  "purpose": "The code provides command-line tools for extracting, embedding, merging, and pretty-printing tuning results in ONNX models, primarily for model optimization workflows.",
  "sources": "Reading ONNX model files, reading JSON tuning result files, command-line arguments for file paths, loading models via onnx.load_model(), reading JSON files via open().",
  "sinks": "Writing JSON files with tuning results, saving modified ONNX models via onnx.save_model(), printing output via pprint, writing error messages to stderr.",
  "flows": "Input files (ONNX or JSON) are loaded via open() or onnx.load_model(). Data is parsed or merged in memory. Embedded or merged data is written back to disk via json.dump() or onnx.save_model().",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors observed. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic present. Use of copy.deepcopy and standard library functions are typical.",
  "analysis": "The script provides file I/O operations for ONNX models and JSON tuning results, with no external network activity, no obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious code patterns. The functions perform data extraction, embedding, merging, and display, with appropriate checks and assertions. No malicious behavior, malicious data leaks, or malicious code execution patterns are detected. Overall, the code is well-structured and appears to serve a legitimate purpose related to model tuning workflows.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate utility for managing tuning results in ONNX models. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on the analysis. It operates solely on local files and data processing tasks without external communications or suspicious logic.",
