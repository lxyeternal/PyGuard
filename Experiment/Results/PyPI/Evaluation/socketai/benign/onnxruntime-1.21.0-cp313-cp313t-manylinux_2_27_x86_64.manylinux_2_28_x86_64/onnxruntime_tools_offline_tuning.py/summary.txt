  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign utility for managing tuning results in ONNX models. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to file handling, which is inherent to such tools. The malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and risk score approximately 0.1, reflecting very low risk."
