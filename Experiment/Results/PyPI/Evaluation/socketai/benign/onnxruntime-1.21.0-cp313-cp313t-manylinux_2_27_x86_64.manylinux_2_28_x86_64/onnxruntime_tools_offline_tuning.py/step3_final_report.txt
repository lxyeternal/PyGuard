  "purpose": "Utility for extracting, embedding, merging, and pretty-printing tuning results within ONNX models.",
  "sources": "Reads model metadata properties, JSON files, and command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "File operations (open, save), JSON serialization/deserialization, ONNX model load/save.",
  "flows": "Input files (JSON/ONNX) -> processing functions -> output files or printed results.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; use of 'assert' is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file I/O, JSON handling, and ONNX model manipulations without network activity or malicious payloads. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present. The code's purpose is benign, and it employs common libraries and practices. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The use of 'assert' is typical for internal checks and does not introduce security risks. The overall behavior aligns with a safe utility script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign utility for managing tuning results in ONNX models. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to file handling, which is inherent to such tools. The malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and risk score approximately 0.1, reflecting very low risk.",
