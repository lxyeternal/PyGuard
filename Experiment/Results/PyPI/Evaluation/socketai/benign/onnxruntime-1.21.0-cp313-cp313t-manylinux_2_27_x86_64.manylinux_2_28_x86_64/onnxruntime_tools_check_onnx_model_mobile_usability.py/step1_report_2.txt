  "purpose": "The script analyzes an ONNX model to assess its usability in mobile scenarios, specifically checking compatibility with NNAPI and CoreML.",
  "sources": "Reads the model_path argument from command-line input, and imports the usability_checker module to analyze the model.",
  "sinks": "Calls analyze_model function from usability_checker with the model_path, and logs output based on the analysis.",
  "flows": "Input: command-line argument 'model_path' -> usability_checker.analyze_model -> Logging output based on the result",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual patterns. No external network communication or data exfiltration found.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward command-line utility that parses input, configures logging, and calls a model analysis function. It imports a helper module, 'usability_checker', to perform the core analysis. No suspicious behaviors such as data leakage, malicious code, or backdoors are present. The module's functionality appears limited to local file analysis and logging. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility script designed for model compatibility analysis. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. The script’s logic is simple, focused on argument parsing and calling a helper function for analysis, with no signs of malicious intent.",
