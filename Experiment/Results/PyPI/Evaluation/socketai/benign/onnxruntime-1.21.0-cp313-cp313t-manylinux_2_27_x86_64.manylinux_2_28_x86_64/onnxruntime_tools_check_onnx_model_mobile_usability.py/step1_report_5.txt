{
  "purpose": "The script analyzes an ONNX model to determine its suitability for mobile scenarios by invoking a usability checker.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from command-line argument 'model_path' as a file path.",
  "sinks": "Calls 'usability_checker.analyze_model' with the provided model path, which may read or process the model file.",
  "flows": "User provides 'model_path' -> 'analyze_model' function processes the model file -> logs the analysis results.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code patterns are present. Usage of relative import could be suspicious in certain contexts but is common in package code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward command-line utility that configures logging, parses arguments, and calls a model analysis function from a local module. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The invocation of 'usability_checker.analyze_model' depends on external code, but within this script, no malicious intent is evident. The code appears to be a legitimate utility for model analysis with no obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs a benign task of analyzing an ONNX model's usability for mobile deployment. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious code. The code structure and logic are straightforward and typical for a CLI tool.",
