  "purpose": "CLI utility to analyze an ONNX model for mobile deployment suitability.",
  "sources": "Reads the model file path from command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Calls external 'usability_checker.analyze_model' function; no direct sinks within this script.",
  "flows": "Input model path -> analyze_model() -> logs output based on analysis result.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward code with standard argument parsing and logging.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI wrapper that sets up argument parsing, logging, and invokes an external helper to analyze a model. It does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present. The external helper's behavior is unknown but assumed benign. The code's structure and purpose are benign, with no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets. The assigned scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for model analysis with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified given the code's simplicity and purpose.",
