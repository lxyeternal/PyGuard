  "purpose": "The script analyzes an ONNX model to determine its suitability for mobile deployment scenarios.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line input for the model file path; uses imported 'usability_checker' to analyze the model.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the 'analyze_model' function could process untrusted model files; logging outputs are informational and not sinks for untrusted data.",
  "flows": "User provides model_path -> analyze_model processes the model -> logs provide analysis results.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI utility that takes a model path as input and uses an external helper ('usability_checker') to analyze the model for mobile suitability. Logging levels are configurable. No data is transmitted externally or processed insecurely. The logic appears standard and focused on usability analysis without any hidden or malicious functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign model analysis task with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on an external helper for core analysis, which appears to be legitimate. No malicious intent detected.",
