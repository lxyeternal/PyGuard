  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the original code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code.**  \nThe code is a straightforward conditional import pattern: it checks if the 'torch' library is available using `importlib.util.find_spec('torch')`. If found, it imports a helper function `infer_input_info` from a local module. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or data leakage.\n\n**Step 2: Identify any errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports.**  \nAll reports agree that the code is benign, standard, and performs a conditional import based on environment. They correctly identify the pattern and dismiss any malicious intent. No report contains logical errors or misinterpretations.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned to each report.**  \n- Confidence: All reports have a confidence of 1, which seems appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- Obfuscated: All reports have 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- Malware: All reports assign 0, which is accurate; there's no malware.\n- SecurityRisk: All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign assessment.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5.**  \nNone of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5; all are at 0, which is justified given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Step 5: Review malware scores.**  \nAll reports assign malware=0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Step 6: Challenge claims based on assumptions.**  \nAll reports are cautious but reasonable, noting that the import is conditional and standard. No assumptions about malicious behavior are made, and the reasoning aligns with best practices.\n\n**Step 7: Ensure consistency of scores and conclusions.**  \nScores are consistent across reports and align with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard pattern for optional dependencies, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The use of `importlib.util.find_spec` is common and safe. The conditional import is a best practice for optional dependencies.\n\n---\n\n### Final notes:\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No changes to scores are necessary.\n- The overall security posture of this code fragment is benign.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a typical, safe conditional import pattern with no malware, obfuscation, or security concerns. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no further action is needed.",
