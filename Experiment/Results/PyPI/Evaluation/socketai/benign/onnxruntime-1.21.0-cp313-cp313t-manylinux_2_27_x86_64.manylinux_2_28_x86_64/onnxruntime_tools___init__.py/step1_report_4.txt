{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to conditionally import a helper module for PyTorch if the 'torch' library is available, likely to facilitate model export or inference tasks within the onnxruntime tools.",
  "sources": "The code reads the presence of the 'torch' module using importlib.util.find_spec.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; there are no untrusted data outputs or external communications.",
  "flows": "The flow checks for the 'torch' module and, if found, imports a helper function from a local module; no external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and standard for conditional imports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports importlib.util to check if the 'torch' module is available in the environment. If 'torch' is detected, it imports a helper function from a relative module, likely for model export purposes. There are no suspicious or malicious constructs, no external network communications, and no evidence of data leaks or backdoors. The code appears to be part of a larger module setup routine, performing a conditional import based on environment capabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign conditional import statement used to enhance functionality if PyTorch is installed. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from this fragment.",
