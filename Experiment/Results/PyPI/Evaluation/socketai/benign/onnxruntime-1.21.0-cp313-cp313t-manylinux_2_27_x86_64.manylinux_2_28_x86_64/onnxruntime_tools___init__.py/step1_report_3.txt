{
  "purpose": "To conditionally import a helper module for PyTorch if the 'torch' library is available, likely for exporting or inference purposes within the onnxruntime package.",
  "sources": "The importlib.util.find_spec('torch') call reads the environment's module search paths to detect the presence of 'torch'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code only conditionally imports a module based on the presence of 'torch'.",
  "flows": "If 'torch' is found, it imports 'infer_input_info' from a local helper module; otherwise, no further action occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code uses standard library functions to check for module availability and conditionally imports a module accordingly.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a benign check for the 'torch' module's presence using importlib.util.find_spec. If 'torch' is available, it imports a helper function from a relative module. The code is straightforward and lacks any suspicious or malicious behavior. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity. The logic is typical for optional dependency handling in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard conditional import based on optional dependencies. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It simply enhances functionality if 'torch' is available.",
