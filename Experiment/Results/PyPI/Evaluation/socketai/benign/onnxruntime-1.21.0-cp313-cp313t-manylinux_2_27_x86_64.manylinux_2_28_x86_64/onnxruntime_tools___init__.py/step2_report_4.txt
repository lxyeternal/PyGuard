  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet, which performs a standard conditional import based on the presence of the 'torch' library.\n- The logic is straightforward: check if 'torch' is available, then import a helper module if so.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious activities are reported or evident.\n- The code uses standard Python practices for optional dependencies, with no signs of data leaks, code injection, or malicious behavior.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of the code in the repository:**\n   - The code is minimal, clear, and typical for handling optional dependencies.\n   - No anomalies or malicious patterns are present.\n   - The report assigns malware and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n2. **Potential issues or concerns:**\n   - The only potential concern could be if the helper module (`pytorch_export_helpers`) itself contains malicious code. However, the snippet and reports do not suggest this, and the import is conditional, not forced.\n   - No evidence of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious network activity.\n\n3. **Scores and justification:**\n   - The reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The security risk score is also 0, which is justified given the benign pattern.\n   - Confidence is high (1) across all reports, which is reasonable.\n\n4. **Assumptions and claims:**\n   - All claims are based on the code's straightforward behavior.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code is a standard pattern.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a standard, safe, conditional import pattern for optional dependencies.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Final note:** The only potential concern would be the content of the helper module, but that is outside the scope of this snippet and reports. Based on the provided information, the code is safe and standard.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate.\n- The code is benign.\n- No changes needed to the scores or conclusions.",
