  "purpose": "Conditional import of a helper module based on the presence of the 'torch' library to enable optional functionality.",
  "sources": "The code reads the environment to check if 'torch' is installed using importlib.util.find_spec('torch').",
  "sinks": "The import statement loads a local module; no untrusted data flows or external data leaks are involved.",
  "flows": "Source: presence check of 'torch' -> Sink: conditional import of 'infer_input_info' from local module.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a standard pattern for optional dependencies with straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a benign check for 'torch' using importlib.util.find_spec, and if found, imports a helper function from a local module. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues. The pattern is common and safe, with no external network activity or data leaks. The scores assigned in all reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and safety. The code does not execute untrusted code directly and relies on standard Python practices for optional dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for optional dependency handling with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores and assessments are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
