{
  "purpose": "The code checks for the presence of the 'torch' library and conditionally imports a helper module related to PyTorch export functionalities.",
  "sources": "importlib.util.find_spec('torch') - reads system package information to detect 'torch'.",
  "sinks": "import statement for '.pytorch_export_helpers' - dynamically imports a module if 'torch' is available.",
  "flows": "Detection of 'torch' -> conditional import of helper module.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors; use of standard library functions and conditional import.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with license comments, then imports 'importlib.util' to check if the 'torch' package is available in the environment. If 'torch' is found, it imports a helper module related to PyTorch export functionality from a relative path. There is no evidence of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code. The code is straightforward and appears to serve a legitimate purpose within the larger module, specifically to facilitate optional PyTorch support.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign conditional import based on the presence of the 'torch' library. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior, and the security risk is minimal. No suspicious activity or malicious patterns are detected.",
