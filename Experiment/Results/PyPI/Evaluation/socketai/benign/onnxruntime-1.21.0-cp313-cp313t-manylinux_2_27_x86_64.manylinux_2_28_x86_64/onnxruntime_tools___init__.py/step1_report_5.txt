{
  "purpose": "The code dynamically imports a helper module if the 'torch' library is available, likely to facilitate model export or inference tasks within the onnxruntime package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the system environment to check for the presence of the 'torch' library using importlib.util.find_spec().",
  "sinks": "The code conditionally imports a module (.pytorch_export_helpers), which could potentially execute code if the module has malicious content, but this is standard dynamic import behavior and not inherently malicious.",
  "flows": "System environment check (find_spec) -> Conditional import of helper module",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded secrets, suspicious backdoors, or unusual behaviors. The code is straightforward and uses standard Python import mechanisms. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code verifies the presence of the 'torch' library in the environment. If available, it imports a helper module related to PyTorch. This is a common pattern for optional dependencies and does not involve any suspicious or malicious activity. No data is leaked, or executed from untrusted sources. The import is conditional and safe, assuming the helper module itself is benign. There are no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard optional dependency check and conditional import without any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a typical pattern for handling optional dependencies in Python packages.",
