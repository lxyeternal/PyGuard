  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the original code and considering the scoring rationale.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code snippet is a minimal, straightforward conditional import pattern based on the presence of the 'torch' library.\n- All reports agree that the code performs a benign check using `importlib.util.find_spec('torch')` and conditionally imports a helper module.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are identified.\n- The import of `infer_input_info` is a local module import, which is standard for optional dependencies.\n- The scores assigned in all reports are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Potential Issues:\n\n- **Code presence:** The code matches exactly the described pattern; no discrepancies.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected; the code is standard for optional dependency handling.\n- **Obfuscation:** None; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risks:** Minimal; no external network activity, no data leaks, no backdoors.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment of individual reports:\n\n- **Reports 1-5:** All agree on the benign nature, correctness, and lack of anomalies. The reasoning is sound, and the conclusions are justified.\n- **Scores:** The `malware` and `obfuscated` scores are 0, which is justified given the code.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n\n- The `securityRisk` score is 0 in all reports, which is appropriate. The code performs a safe, conditional import.\n- The `malware` score is 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- The `obfuscated` score is 0, reflecting the code's clarity.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the code and reports, I agree with the assigned scores.** The code is a standard, safe pattern for optional dependencies, with no malicious or suspicious activity.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, just because it involves dynamic imports, but this is standard practice)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is benign, with no evidence of malware or obfuscation. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No further action needed; the code is safe and well-understood.",
