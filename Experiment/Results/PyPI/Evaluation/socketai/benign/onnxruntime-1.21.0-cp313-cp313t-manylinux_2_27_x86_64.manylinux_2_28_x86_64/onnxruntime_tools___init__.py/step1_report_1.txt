  "purpose": "To conditionally import a helper module for PyTorch export if the 'torch' library is available.",
  "sources": "importlib.util.find_spec('torch') to check for 'torch' module availability.",
  "sinks": "The import of 'infer_input_info' if 'torch' is present; potential dynamic import based on environment.",
  "flows": "The code checks for 'torch' presence; if found, it imports a helper module for further processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs a standard conditional import based on module availability. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with standard licensing comments. It imports 'importlib.util' to dynamically check for the presence of the 'torch' library. If 'torch' is available, it imports a helper function from a local module. This is a common pattern to avoid import errors when optional dependencies are missing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data leakage. The code is minimal, straightforward, and uses standard Python practices for optional dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard conditional import based on optional dependency availability, with no malicious or security concerns identified.",
