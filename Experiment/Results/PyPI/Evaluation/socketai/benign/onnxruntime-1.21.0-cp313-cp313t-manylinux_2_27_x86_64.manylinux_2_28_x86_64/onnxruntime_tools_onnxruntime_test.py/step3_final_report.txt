  "purpose": "A utility script for loading an ONNX model, generating random inputs, running inference multiple times, and optionally profiling or debugging.",
  "sources": "sess.get_inputs(), sess.get_overridable_initializers(), sys.stdin.read()",
  "sinks": "sess.run() (model inference), sys.exit(-1) on unsupported types",
  "flows": "Input metadata -> generate_feeds() -> feeds -> run_model() -> sess.run() -> outputs",
  "anomalies": "Use of sys.exit(-1) for unsupported types; no network activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility for testing ONNX models. It loads a model, generates random input data based on input metadata, optionally overrides initializers, and runs inference multiple times. It supports debugging and profiling. Error handling with sys.exit(-1) on unsupported types is standard. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The data generation and API usage are standard and safe. No signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard ONNX inference benchmarking utility. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal risk is due to standard error handling practices, which do not pose security concerns. The code is safe for use and poses negligible security risk.",
