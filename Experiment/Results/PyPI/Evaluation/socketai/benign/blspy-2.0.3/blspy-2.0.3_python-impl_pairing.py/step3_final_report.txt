  "purpose": "Implementation of elliptic curve pairings (BLS12-381), including Miller loop, final exponentiation, and line evaluations for cryptographic operations.",
  "sources": "Reads elliptic curve points (R, Q, P), field elements, and parameters from external modules; no external data input observed.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data exfiltration points identified; no network or file operations present.",
  "flows": "Uses elliptic curve points and field elements as sources; performs mathematical computations within functions without external data output or side effects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected; code structure is straightforward and standard for cryptographic routines.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard elliptic curve pairing algorithms (Miller loop, final exponentiation) for BLS12-381, relying on external cryptographic libraries. Functions perform well-known mathematical operations with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are consistent with the code's cryptographic nature. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are evident, and the code aligns with best practices for such cryptographic primitives.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of elliptic curve pairings used in cryptography. It shows no evidence of malicious intent, sabotage, or obfuscation. The low security risk score is appropriate given the context. Overall, the code is safe for supply chain use.",
