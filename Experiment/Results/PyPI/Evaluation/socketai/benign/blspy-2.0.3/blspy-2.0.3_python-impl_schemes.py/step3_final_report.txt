  "purpose": "Implementation of BLS signature schemes including key generation, signing, verification, aggregation, and derivation functions, utilizing elliptic curve cryptography and pairing operations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as seed bytes, messages, and public/private keys; elliptic curve points from key derivation and signing functions.",
  "sinks": "Pairing computations (`ate_pairing_multi`), point validation (`check_valid()`), elliptic curve point operations, cryptographic checks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through key derivation or message processing into elliptic curve points, which are validated and used in pairing-based verification or aggregation functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; validation functions are used appropriately; no external network or file I/O present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard BLS signature schemes with proper validation (`check_valid()`) on elliptic curve points before cryptographic operations. Pairing functions are used correctly for verification and aggregation. No malicious or backdoor code, no obfuscation, and no suspicious data flows are evident. The cryptographic primitives and validation steps align with best practices, reducing risk of malformed data or misuse. The consistent zero malware score and low risk score across reports reflect the benign and standard nature of this implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure implementation of BLS signature schemes with proper validation and no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low risk score accurately reflects the cryptographic complexity without indicating vulnerabilities. Overall, the code appears safe and trustworthy.",
