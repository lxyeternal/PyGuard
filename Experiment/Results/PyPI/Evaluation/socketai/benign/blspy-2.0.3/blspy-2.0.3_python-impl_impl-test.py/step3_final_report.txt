{
  "purpose": "This code is a cryptographic test suite verifying the correctness of various cryptographic primitives, key derivations, signatures, and edge cases using hardcoded vectors, seed inputs, and internal cryptographic functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from hardcoded test vectors, seed bytes, and token_bytes, used for key generation, signing, and verification.",
  "sinks": "Data remains within cryptographic functions; no external network, file, or system I/O occurs.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from hardcoded vectors and seed bytes into key derivation, signing, verification, and cryptographic computations, with no external data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of debug print statements and reliance on hardcoded secrets are typical in testing environments; no suspicious or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs comprehensive cryptographic validation, including elliptic curve operations, signature schemes, and vector matching. It uses standard practices such as exception handling and assertions. No network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation is present. The reliance on hardcoded vectors and debug prints is common in testing but not indicative of malicious intent. The high confidence scores and low malware risk scores are justified given the code's purpose as a correctness verification suite.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate cryptographic test suite with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. It is safe for supply chain use, with risks typical for testing code due to hardcoded vectors and debug statements. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting minimal risk in a testing context.",
