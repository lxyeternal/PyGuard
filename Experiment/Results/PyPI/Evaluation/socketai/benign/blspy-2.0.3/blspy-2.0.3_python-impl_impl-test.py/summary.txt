  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate cryptographic test suite with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. It is safe for supply chain use, with risks typical for testing code due to hardcoded vectors and debug statements. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting minimal risk in a testing context."
