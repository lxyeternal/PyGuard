  "purpose": "Cryptographic private key management, including key derivation, serialization, and aggregation.",
  "sources": "Input data includes seed bytes, byte buffers, and integer values for key creation; external modules for elliptic curve operations and HKDF.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; internal operations are standard cryptographic computations without data leaks.",
  "flows": "Seed or byte input → HKDF extract_expand → key value → elliptic curve multiplication; key aggregation sums private key values modulo group order.",
  "anomalies": "The 'sign' method is unimplemented, indicating incomplete functionality but not malicious intent; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of cryptographic key management, using standard primitives and practices. The unimplemented 'sign' method is a placeholder, not a security flaw. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's content. The absence of hardcoded secrets and suspicious data flows further supports its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure cryptographic key class with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The incomplete 'sign' method is a non-security-related placeholder. Overall, it poses no supply chain security risk.",
