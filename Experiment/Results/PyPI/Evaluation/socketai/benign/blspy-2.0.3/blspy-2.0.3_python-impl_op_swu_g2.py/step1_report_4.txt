  "purpose": "Implementations of hash-to-curve mappings and isogeny maps for BLS12-381 G2 in a cryptographic context, specifically optimized SWU map and related functions.",
  "sources": "Input bytes in g2_map(), input parameter t in osswu2_help(), imported modules (bls12381, ec, fields, hash_to_field).",
  "sinks": "Calculation of elliptic curve points, potential for data leaks if used insecurely, no explicit data leakage points observed.",
  "flows": "Bytes input → hash-to-field expansion → osswu2_help mapping → iso3 isogeny map → final JacobianPoint in G2 subgroup.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets such as private keys or credentials; no suspicious network or system commands; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation. The code performs standard elliptic curve map calculations with known cryptographic formulas.",
  "analysis": "The code is a cryptographic implementation of hashing to elliptic curve points on BLS12-381 G2, involving complex mathematical operations including square roots in finite fields, isogeny mappings, and coordinate transformations. All imported modules and functions relate to elliptic curve math, with no indications of hidden or malicious behavior. The presence of hardcoded constants and the use of standard cryptographic procedures suggest a legitimate cryptographic purpose. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident. The code appears to follow known standards for hashing to elliptic curves, and the functions are self-contained with proper assertions and error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard cryptographic implementation of hash-to-curve procedures for BLS12-381 G2, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It performs mathematically complex operations consistent with cryptographic standards. There are no indicators of malware, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code is likely legitimate and safe in context.",
