  "purpose": "Implementation of hash-to-curve for BLS12-381 G2 using optimized SWU map, isogenies, and sqrt calculations, following cryptographic standards.",
  "sources": "Input 'alpha' processed via 'Hp2' (hash-to-field) into elliptic curve points.",
  "sinks": "Elliptic curve point constructions, no external system interaction or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Alpha -> Hp2 -> elliptic curve map functions -> elliptic curve points.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard cryptographic hash-to-curve procedures for BLS12-381 G2, including the SWU map, isogeny transformations, sqrt computations, and sign adjustments. Constants and parameters are consistent with known standards. No malicious patterns, external calls, or covert channels are present. The functions are deterministic and mathematically sound, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard cryptographic implementation for hashing to G2 on BLS12-381. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are evident. The low risk and malware scores are justified and appropriate.",
