  "purpose": "The code implements an optimized simplified Shallue–van de Woestijne–Ulas (SWU) map for hashing to the G2 subgroup of the BLS12-381 elliptic curve, including the 3-isogeny map from an auxiliary curve to the target elliptic curve, used for cryptographic hashing to the curve.",
  "sources": "Reads from imported modules (bls12381, ec, fields, hash_to_field), and the input parameter 'alpha' in g2_map which is bytes decoded via Hp2 to field elements.",
  "sinks": "The function g2_map outputs elliptic curve points; no data is written to external systems or network; no sensitive data is stored or transmitted within the code itself.",
  "flows": "Input bytes (alpha) are processed through Hp2 to obtain field elements; these are then mapped via opt_swu2_map, which internally calls osswu2_help to produce curve points; the points are then mapped via iso3 to the elliptic curve, producing a point in G2 subgroup.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code segments detected. The code is primarily mathematical elliptic curve operations. No obfuscated code, no unusual dynamic execution, or misleading variable names. The etas constants contain precomputed values but no indication of malicious intent. No network activity, data leaks, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs elliptic curve hashing operations, mapping field elements to points on a curve using established mathematical techniques. It utilizes precomputed constants for eta values and isogeny mappings, standard in curve hashing schemes. No indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The functions are mathematical and deterministic, with no external system calls or network communication. The imported modules are standard for elliptic curve cryptography, and the code structure follows cryptographic standards. Overall, the code appears to implement legitimate cryptographic mapping functions without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard implementation of cryptographic hashing to elliptic curves, with no evidence of malicious behavior. It employs mathematical techniques consistent with cryptographic standards and does not perform any suspicious activities such as data theft or system manipulation.",
