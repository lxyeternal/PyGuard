  "purpose": "Implementation of the optimized simplified SWU map to the BLS12-381 G2 curve, including 3-isogeny transformations for hash-to-curve.",
  "sources": "Input data from functions such as Hp2 (hash-to-field), and parameters like t, t2, or external inputs to g2_map. Data is also read from imported modules and constants.",
  "sinks": "Mathematical computations leading to elliptic curve points, with no direct data leaks or external communications observed.",
  "flows": "Input bytes (via Hp2) → Fq2 elements → osswu2_help computations → iso3 (iso3 map) → G2 point generation → optional combination with t2 → scaled by h_eff.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code performs mathematical elliptic curve mappings with standard cryptographic operations. The only notable features are the explicit parameters and constants, which are standard for such implementations. No network, file I/O, or system command execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements elliptic curve hashing functions with mathematical transformations for mapping to BLS12-381 G2. It uses constants and parameters consistent with cryptographic standards. Functions like sgn0 perform sign determination, while osswu2_help handles the core map with sqrt calculations and sign adjustments. The iso3 function applies a known 3-isogeny map, and g2_map converts bytes into elliptic curve points through hashing and mapping. All operations are purely mathematical and consistent with cryptographic hash-to-curve procedures. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system compromise, or covert channels are evident. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of a hash-to-curve method.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, mathematically oriented implementation of elliptic curve hashing to BLS12-381 G2. No malicious or suspicious activities are present. The code is focused on cryptographic mappings without external system interactions or covert behaviors. The security and integrity of this code rely on the correctness of the cryptographic parameters and algorithms, which align with established standards.",
