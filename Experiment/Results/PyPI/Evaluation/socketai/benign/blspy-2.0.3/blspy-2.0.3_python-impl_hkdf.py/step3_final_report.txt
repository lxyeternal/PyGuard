  "purpose": "Implementation of HKDF (HMAC-based Extract-and-Expand Key Derivation Function) functions: extract, expand, and extract_expand.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: salt, ikm, key, info; internal HMAC computations.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; cryptographic functions process data internally without side effects.",
  "flows": "Input data (salt, ikm, key, info) flows into extract, then into expand via prk; expand outputs key material.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; straightforward cryptographic code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, correct implementation of HKDF using hashlib and hmac. It performs extract, expand, and combined extract_expand functions following cryptographic best practices. No external network or file operations are present. The code structure is clear, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious logic. The license comments are standard. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard HKDF implementation with no malicious intent or security issues. All signals indicate benign cryptographic functions. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score should be 0 across all reports. The slight elevation to 0.2 in one report is unwarranted given the code's benign nature.",
