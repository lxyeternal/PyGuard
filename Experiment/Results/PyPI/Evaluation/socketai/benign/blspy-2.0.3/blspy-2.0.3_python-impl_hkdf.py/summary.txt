  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard HKDF implementation with no malicious intent or security issues. All signals indicate benign cryptographic functions. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score should be 0 across all reports. The slight elevation to 0.2 in one report is unwarranted given the code's benign nature."
