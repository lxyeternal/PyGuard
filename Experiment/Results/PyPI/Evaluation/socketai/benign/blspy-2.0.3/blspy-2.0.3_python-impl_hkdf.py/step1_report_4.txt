{
  "purpose": "The code implements cryptographic key derivation functions (HKDF) using HMAC with SHA-256, specifically for securely extracting and expanding keys.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: salt, ikm (initial key material), key, salt, info, and L for desired output length.",
  "sinks": "The digest outputs from HMAC functions and the final derived key material (okm). No external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The input data (salt, ikm, key, info) flows into HMAC functions for extraction and expansion; the output flows into the return statement as the derived key.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of HKDF without unusual constructs or hidden behaviors. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious functions are present.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly follows the HKDF specification, using standard Python libraries (hashlib, hmac). It performs cryptographic operations without any external or network access, nor does it contain suspicious or malicious logic. The licensing information is benign and standard for open-source cryptographic code.",
  "conclusion": "This code provides a standard implementation of HKDF for key derivation, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security issues. It is a typical, well-structured cryptographic utility.",
