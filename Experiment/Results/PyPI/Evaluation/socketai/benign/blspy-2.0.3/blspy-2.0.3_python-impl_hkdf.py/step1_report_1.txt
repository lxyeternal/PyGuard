{
  "purpose": "The code implements key derivation functions (extract, expand, extract_expand) based on HMAC and SHA-256, likely for cryptographic key management or security protocols.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters: salt, ikm, key, info.",
  "sinks": "The code performs cryptographic operations but does not send data over the network, access files, or interact with external systems.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed through HMAC-based functions to produce derived key material; no external data flow or untrusted input usage beyond the function parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The implementation aligns with standard HKDF (HMAC-based Extract-and-Expand Key Derivation Function).",
  "analysis": "The code follows standard cryptographic practices for HKDF using hashlib and hmac libraries, with clear structure and no signs of malicious activity. There are no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious data leaks, and no external network or file interactions. The functions are purely computational, serving as cryptographic primitives. Overall, the code appears to be a standard, legitimate implementation of key derivation functions without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of HKDF with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate cryptographic utility, likely used for secure key derivation in broader systems.",
