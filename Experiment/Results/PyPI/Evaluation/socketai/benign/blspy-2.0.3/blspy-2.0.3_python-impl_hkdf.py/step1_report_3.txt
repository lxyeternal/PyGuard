{
  "purpose": "This code implements cryptographic key derivation functions using HMAC and SHA-256, specifically extract and expand functions for key stretching or derivation.",
  "sources": "Inputs include 'salt', 'ikm' (initial keying material), 'L' (length), 'prk' (pseudorandom key), 'info' (context info), and 'key' (initial key).",
  "sinks": "Computed cryptographic outputs, used for secure key material; no data leakage or untrusted data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through HMAC functions to produce digest outputs, then these outputs are combined and extended to generate the final keying material.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a standard implementation of HKDF (HMAC-based Extract-and-Expand Key Derivation Function). It follows typical cryptographic practices without suspicious alterations. The functions are self-contained, stateless, and perform cryptographic operations as intended. No external data is retrieved or sent, and no side-channel or privilege escalation mechanisms are evident. The licensing comment indicates proper attribution. Overall, the code appears legitimate and focused solely on secure key derivation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of cryptographic HKDF functions, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security issues. It appears safe for use in security-critical applications.",
