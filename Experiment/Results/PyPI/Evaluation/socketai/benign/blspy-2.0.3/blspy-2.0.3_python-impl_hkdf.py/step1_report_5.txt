  "purpose": "Implement cryptographic key derivation functions using HMAC and SHA-256 as specified in cryptographic standards.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as salt, ikm, key, and info, which are used in cryptographic operations.",
  "sinks": "Cryptographic outputs (digest, okm) which are used as derived keys; no external system effects or data leaks directly observed.",
  "flows": "Input data (salt, ikm, key, info) flows into cryptographic functions (extract, expand, extract_expand), producing derived key material.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code implements standard cryptographic procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code implements HKDF (HMAC-based Extract-and-Expand Key Derivation Function) following standard cryptographic practices. Functions are straightforward, using well-known libraries (hashlib, hmac). No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected. The presence of licensing comments and standard cryptographic operations indicates normal, intended use. No external network or file system operations, and no data exfiltration or malicious activity identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of cryptographic key derivation functions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is consistent with typical cryptographic library code and contains no indicators of supply chain attacks or malware.",
