{
  "purpose": "The code implements cryptographic key derivation functions (extract and expand) following the HKDF standard, intended for securely deriving keys from input material.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'salt', 'ikm' (initial keying material), 'L', 'prk', 'info', and 'key'. These are read from function arguments and internal variables.",
  "sinks": "Output: the derived key material 'okm'. No untrusted data is written to external systems or network.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through cryptographic functions (extract and expand) to produce 'okm', with no external data leaks or side effects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors detected; use of standard cryptographic libraries and functions without obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly implements HKDF with separate extract and expand phases, using standard libraries (hashlib, hmac). It includes necessary calculations, loops, and assertions for integrity. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to cryptographic best practices. It contains license information but no suspicious or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This module provides a standard, secure implementation of HKDF-based key derivation. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It is a clean, legitimate cryptographic utility.",
