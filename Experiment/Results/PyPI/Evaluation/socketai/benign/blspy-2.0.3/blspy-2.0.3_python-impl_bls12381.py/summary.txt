  "conclusion": "The code is a static, well-documented set of cryptographic parameters for the BLS12-381 elliptic curve, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. All reports correctly identify it as standard cryptographic setup, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary."
