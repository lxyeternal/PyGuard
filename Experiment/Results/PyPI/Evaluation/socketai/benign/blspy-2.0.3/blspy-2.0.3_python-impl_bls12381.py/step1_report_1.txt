  "purpose": "Define cryptographic parameters for elliptic curve operations on the BLS12-381 curve used in pairing-based cryptography.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded cryptographic constants, including field parameters, generator points, and curve coefficients.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output; constants are predefined and used internally.",
  "flows": "Constants are set during initialization and used for cryptographic computations; no external data flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious activities. The code strictly defines cryptographic parameters. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides static cryptographic parameters for elliptic curve cryptography, including primes, generator points, and curve coefficients, all hardcoded as constants. There are no data input sources, external calls, or data leaks. No dynamic code execution, no suspicious behaviors, and no obfuscation present. It appears to be a straightforward cryptographic parameter setup for a known secure elliptic curve.\n\nThe code includes license information and references to standards, indicating intent for standard cryptographic use. No malicious or sabotage code elements are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely defines cryptographic constants necessary for elliptic curve operations on the BLS12-381 curve. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities. It appears to be a standard, well-documented parameter set used in cryptographic implementations.",
