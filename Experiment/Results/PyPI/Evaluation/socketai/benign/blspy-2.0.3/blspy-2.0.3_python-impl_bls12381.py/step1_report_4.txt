  "purpose": "Define parameters for elliptic curve cryptography related to BLS12-381 pairing-friendly curve, used in cryptographic protocols.",
  "sources": "Constants and variable definitions including cryptographic parameters, group generators, and curve coefficients.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified that handle untrusted data; code primarily defines fixed cryptographic parameters.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; all parameters are hardcoded within the module.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution detected. The code solely defines cryptographic parameters and functions returning them.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static definitions for elliptic curve parameters, group generators, and related constants for BLS12-381. It uses fixed, well-known values for cryptographic operations. No input handling, no dynamic execution, no external data fetching, and no obfuscated code are present. The functions simply return predefined parameter tuples, which is typical for cryptographic parameter files. The licensing information is standard and does not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward parameter definition module for BLS12-381 elliptic curve cryptography. It contains no malicious behavior, no hidden backdoors, and no suspicious activity. It is a benign component intended for cryptographic operations.",
