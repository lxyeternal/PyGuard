  "purpose": "Define cryptographic parameters for BLS12-381 elliptic curve used in pairing-based cryptography, including group generators, curve coefficients, and other constants.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded constants such as q, x, n, h, h_eff, sqrt_n3, sqrt_n3m1o2; imported modules 'fields' (Fq, Fq2). No external input sources or data reads observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input; code primarily assigns and returns constants. No data leaks or external outputs identified.",
  "flows": "Constants are assigned directly to variables; functions return tuples of parameters. No dynamic data flow or source-to-sink data propagation observed.",
  "anomalies": "All parameters are hardcoded cryptographic constants; no secrets appear to be dynamically fetched or derived at runtime. No obfuscated or suspicious code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code defines cryptographic parameters for elliptic curves, including field elements, generators, and constants, with references to external specifications and licensing. There are no indications of data processing, input/output operations, or malicious logic. The use of hardcoded cryptographic parameters is typical in such cryptography libraries. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors detected. The code appears standard for defining such parameters.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists solely of cryptographic parameter definitions essential for BLS12-381 elliptic curve operations. It contains no malicious behaviors, backdoors, or security risks. All constants are standard, well-documented, and used as part of cryptographic protocols. No malicious intent or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
