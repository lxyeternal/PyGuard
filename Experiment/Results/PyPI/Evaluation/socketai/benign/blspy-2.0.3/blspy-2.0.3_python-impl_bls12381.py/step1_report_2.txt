  "purpose": "Define parameters for the BLS12-381 elliptic curve used in cryptographic operations, including G1 and G2 groups, for pairing-based cryptography.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions of curve parameters, group generators, and mathematical constants embedded in the code.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or involve data leakage. No network or I/O operations observed.",
  "flows": "Static constants flow into cryptographic functions (not shown) that utilize these parameters for elliptic curve operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code solely defines cryptographic parameters and functions returning them.",
  "analysis": "The code imports from external modules (fields), defines various elliptic curve parameters, generators, and constants associated with the BLS12-381 pairing-friendly curve. The parameters are standard and well-documented for cryptographic use. No data input, network activity, or suspicious logic present. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical cryptographic parameter definitions. No malicious behavior or malicious code structure identified.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a legitimate parameter definition for the BLS12-381 elliptic curve used in cryptographic protocols. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a standard cryptographic setup module.",
