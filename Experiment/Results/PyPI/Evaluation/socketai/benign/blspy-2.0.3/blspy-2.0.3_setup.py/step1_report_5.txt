  "purpose": "This setup script is used to build and install the 'blspy' package, which involves compiling C++ extensions using CMake.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (e.g., CXXFLAGS), system commands (cmake), filesystem (checking/creating directories), and package metadata (version).",
  "sinks": "Calls to subprocess for 'cmake' commands, environment variable modification, filesystem modifications (directory creation).",
  "flows": "Environment variables (CXXFLAGS) and system commands (cmake) are used to compile extensions, with potential data flows from environment and filesystem to build process.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. Uses standard build procedures. No obfuscated code detected. All subprocess calls are for standard build commands.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom build classes for CMake-based extension compilation. It verifies the presence of CMake, sets build configurations based on platform, and executes build commands with environment modifications. No untrusted input sources or malicious data handling observed. The subprocess calls are standard for building C++ extensions. No suspicious behaviors, malicious payloads, or data leaks detected. The script aligns with typical setup procedures for compiling extensions with CMake.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for building a Python package with C++ extensions via CMake. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. All subprocess calls are intended for normal compilation workflows. The overall risk is very low.",
