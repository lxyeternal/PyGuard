{
  "purpose": "This code defines a setup script for building a Python package with CMake-based C++ extensions, specifically for the 'blspy' package related to BLS signatures.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, checking for CMake installation, reading package metadata from Path('README.md')",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls to 'cmake' and 'cmake --build', environment variable modification, file system operations (creating directories), reading package description from file",
  "flows": "Environment variables (CXXFLAGS) and configuration parameters flow into subprocess calls for building CMake extensions",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no backdoors, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network connections, no malicious payloads",
  "analysis": "The script primarily orchestrates building a C++ extension using CMake, with standard environment checks and setup procedures. It verifies CMake presence, configures build parameters, sets environment variables, and executes build commands. All subprocess calls invoke external build tools and do not process untrusted input directly. Reading README.md is standard for package metadata. No suspicious or malicious code behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for building a Python package with C++ extensions via CMake. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. The operations are standard and relate solely to package compilation and metadata reading.",
