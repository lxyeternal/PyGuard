{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to build a Python package named 'blspy' that includes C++ extensions using CMake.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (os.environ), subprocess calls for 'cmake' commands, reading the README.md file for long description.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls to 'cmake' with controlled arguments, environment variable modifications, file system operations (creating directories).",
  "flows": "Environment variables and subprocess command execution flow from the code to external processes (cmake), which influence build configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess to invoke system commands with controlled parameters; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code. No indication of code injection or obfuscated code. Use of environment variables is standard for build systems.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for building Python C extensions using CMake. It performs environment checks, sets build parameters, and calls external build tools. All subprocess calls are parameterized and controlled, and no malicious activity such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors is detected. No suspicious or anomalous behaviors are present. The script relies on standard build tools and processes without any obfuscation or hidden code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate build script for a Python package that uses CMake. There are no signs of malicious intent or malware. It employs standard practices for building C++ extensions in Python projects.",
