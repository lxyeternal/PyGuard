{
  "purpose": "This script is designed to configure, build, and install a Python package named 'blspy' that includes C++ extensions compiled via CMake.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (os.environ), system information (platform.system()), command-line arguments (sys), file paths (Path), and package configuration data (setup()).",
  "sinks": "Calls external processes (subprocess.check_output and subprocess.check_call) to invoke CMake and build commands; reads package version from file; uses environment variables for build configuration.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and system info are used to configure CMake build process, which compiles native extensions. No untrusted data directly flows into critical build commands or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are detected. The code strictly manages build process and environment configuration. No network connections or data exfiltration code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines custom build classes for CMake-based extension compilation. It verifies CMake presence, configures build parameters based on platform, and sets environment variables for compilation. The setup() function configures the package, including the source directory, dependencies, and build commands. All operations are standard for building Python extensions with CMake, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical build script for a Python package with C++ extensions, utilizing CMake. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data flows. The script performs its intended function securely and transparently.",
