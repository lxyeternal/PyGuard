  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and any potential concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard setup script for building a Python package with CMake, with no malicious or suspicious activity detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies the code as a typical build setup, with no malicious activity. The malware and security risk scores are appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard build procedures with subprocess calls to CMake, environment variables, and no suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the analysis aligns with the code. The subprocess calls are standard, and no malicious intent is evident. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard build script with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with previous reports. No issues detected, scores appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard build process, no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the analysis is consistent. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Slightly more detailed, noting standard build procedures, environment variable use, and no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (slightly higher than others)\n\n**Assessment:**  \nWhile the code is standard, the report assigns a minor security risk score of 0.1, possibly due to the use of environment variables and subprocess calls. However, these are typical in build scripts and do not constitute a security risk unless manipulated maliciously.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nThe slight elevation in the security risk score (0.1) seems unwarranted given the context. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident. I would suggest lowering this to 0 to reflect the benign nature of the script.\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusions:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are correctly at 0; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** All are 0, as expected.\n- **Risk scores:** Most are 0, with one at 0.1. Given the analysis, all should be 0, since the code is standard build configuration with no malicious or risky behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final estimated scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code or payloads detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk beyond normal build procedures)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, standard build script for a Python package with C++ extensions via CMake. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, except for the minor security risk in report 5, which should be lowered to 0.",
