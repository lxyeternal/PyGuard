  "purpose": "This setup script configures the build process for a Python package that includes C++ extensions built via CMake.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables (os.environ), system calls (subprocess), file system (os.path, Path), and package configuration (setup parameters).",
  "sinks": "System calls for subprocess execution (subprocess.check_output, check_call) that could potentially execute malicious commands if manipulated, and environment variable modifications.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and system commands are used to configure and invoke CMake build process, passing parameters from script to subprocesses.",
  "anomalies": "The code constructs environment variables and command arguments based on the build configuration, but all appear to be standard build procedures without any hardcoded secrets or suspicious commands. The use of subprocess to invoke CMake is typical for C++ extension builds.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily manages build configuration for a C++ extension via CMake. It performs environment checks (CMake version), sets build arguments based on platform, and invokes build commands. It does not process or accept untrusted user input during runtime, nor does it contain network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code. All subprocess commands are standard for building CMake projects. No hardcoded credentials or malicious behaviors are detected. The code appears to be a legitimate build setup with standard procedures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for building a Python extension using CMake. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this code fragment. It does not perform any suspicious operations, nor does it include malicious payloads. Overall, it appears safe and legitimate.",
