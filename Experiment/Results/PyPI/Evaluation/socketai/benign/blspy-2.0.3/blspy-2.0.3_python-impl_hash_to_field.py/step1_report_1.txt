  "purpose": "Implementation of hash-to-field functions for cryptographic operations, specifically for BLS signatures, including message expansion and field element derivation.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the 'msg' parameter, DST parameter for domain separation, and hash functions. Constants like 'q' are imported from an external module.",
  "sinks": "Uses cryptographic hash functions (hashlib.sha256), and converts data between bytes and integers; no data is sent over the network or written to files within this code.",
  "flows": "Input 'msg' flows into message expansion functions, which then generate pseudo-random bytes. These bytes are then converted into field elements via modular reduction, returning u_vals.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior. No hardcoded secrets or credentials; the code performs standard cryptographic operations. No obfuscated or misleading code features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard cryptographic primitives for hash-to-field conversions used in elliptic curve cryptography, following specifications. All functions perform deterministic transformations without side channels or hidden behaviors. No external data transmission, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident. The imported 'q' appears to be a curve order parameter, and the functions are well-structured for cryptographic use. There are no signs of malicious intent, code injection, or data leakage points.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of cryptographic hash-to-field functions with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It follows established specifications and appears safe for cryptographic use.",
