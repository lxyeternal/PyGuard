It does not exhibit malicious intent or payloads but includes high-privilege operations that could be exploited if misused. The malware score is low (~0.2), reflecting potential misuse, and the security risk score is moderate (~0.4–0.7), justified by the system modifications involved."

The use of internal qtawesome functions is typical for resource handling and does not indicate malicious behavior. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), primarily due to reliance on internal functions, which is acceptable in this context."
