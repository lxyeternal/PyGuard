  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a legitimate font management utility with system-level font installation capabilities. It does not exhibit malicious intent or payloads but includes high-privilege operations that could be exploited if misused. The malware score is low (~0.2), reflecting potential misuse, and the security risk score is moderate (~0.4–0.7), justified by the system modifications involved."
