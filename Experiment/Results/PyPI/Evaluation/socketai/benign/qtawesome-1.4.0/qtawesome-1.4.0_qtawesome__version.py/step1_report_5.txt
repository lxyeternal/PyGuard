  "purpose": "Define the package version by concatenating version number components into a string.",
  "sources": "The tuple 'version_info' provides version number components.",
  "sinks": "The string join operation outputs the version string, but no untrusted data handling or external data sources are present.",
  "flows": "The version_info tuple is converted to strings, then joined into the __version__ string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code is straightforward and simple.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a version_info tuple with fixed integers, then constructs a string __version__ by joining the tuple's string representations with periods. No external inputs, no data processing beyond string conversion and concatenation. No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious or obfuscated code, no network activity, or other malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard version assignment with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe.",
