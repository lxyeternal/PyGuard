  "purpose": "Define the version of the module or package.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data: a tuple (1, 4, 0).",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could cause harm.",
  "flows": "The static tuple is converted to strings and joined to form a version string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and uses standard practices for defining version information.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a tuple with version numbers, then creates a string representation of the version by joining the tuple elements with dots. There are no inputs from external sources, no dynamic code execution, no secrets, and no suspicious behavior. The code serves a simple purpose of version identification without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard version assignment snippet with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
