  "purpose": "Define the version of the package or module using a tuple and create a string representation.",
  "sources": "The variable 'version_info' which holds version components.",
  "sinks": "The '__version__' variable assignment which outputs the version string.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'version_info' tuple to the 'map' function, then to 'join' to produce '__version__'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward and typical for version assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a tuple with version components (1, 4, 0). It then converts each component to string and joins them with dots to create a version string stored in '__version__'. There are no external inputs, outputs, or suspicious constructs. The structure is standard for defining package version info.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a normal, non-malicious way to define a version string for a Python package. It poses no security risks or signs of malicious behavior.",
