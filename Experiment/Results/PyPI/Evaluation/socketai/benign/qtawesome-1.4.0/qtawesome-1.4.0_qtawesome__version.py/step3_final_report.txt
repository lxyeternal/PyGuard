  "purpose": "Define module version as a string based on a static tuple.",
  "sources": "Static tuple 'version_info' containing version components.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to '__version__' variable.",
  "flows": "Tuple 'version_info' → String conversion with 'map' → Joining with '.' → Assignment to '__version__'.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static code with no dynamic or suspicious elements.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a tuple of version numbers to 'version_info', converts each element to a string, joins them with dots, and assigns the result to '__version__'. It is a common pattern for version declaration in Python packages. No external inputs, no dynamic code execution, no secrets, and no obfuscation are present. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no malicious behavior or vulnerabilities. The code's simplicity and clarity justify malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0, with confidence at 1.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version string assignment with no security concerns or malicious intent. All reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
