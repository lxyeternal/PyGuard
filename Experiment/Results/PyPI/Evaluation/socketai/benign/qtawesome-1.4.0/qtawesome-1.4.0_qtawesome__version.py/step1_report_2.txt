  "purpose": "Define and assign a version string based on a tuple of version components",
  "sources": "Tuple 'version_info' defined in the code",
  "sinks": "Joining the version components into a string and assigning to '__version__'",
  "flows": "Reading 'version_info' → Converting elements to strings → Joining with '.' → Assigning to '__version__'",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward version assignment",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a tuple with version numbers, then creates a string version by joining the tuple elements. This is a common pattern for version management. No untrusted input, data leakage, or malicious behavior observed. No suspicious code constructs or obfuscation present. No hardcoded secrets or insecure patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version assignment without malicious intent or security risks.",
