  "purpose": "Define the version of the package or module as a string.",
  "sources": "None; the code only constructs a version string from a tuple.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow to untrusted sources or external outputs.",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward version string construction with no hidden or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a tuple 'version_info' with version components (1, 4, 0). It then creates a string '__version__' by joining the elements of the tuple converted to strings with dots. The code is simple and standard for defining version info, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious intent. No external data inputs, no data leaks, or suspicious operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to define a version string for a package or module. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
