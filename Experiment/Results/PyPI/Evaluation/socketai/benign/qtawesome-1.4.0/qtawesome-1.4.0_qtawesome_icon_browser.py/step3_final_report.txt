{
  "purpose": "A GUI application for browsing, filtering, styling, and copying icon identifiers from the qtawesome library.",
  "sources": "Reads user input from filter line edit, font selection combo box, style combo box, and icon list selection; accesses internal qtawesome resources (_instance(), _resource).",
  "sinks": "Copies icon identifier text to clipboard; updates GUI elements based on user interaction.",
  "flows": "User inputs in filter and style controls update the proxy model and appearance; selection in icon list updates the name field and enables copying; internal resource access occurs during initialization and style updates.",
  "anomalies": "Uses internal qtawesome functions (_instance(), _resource) which are typically internal API; no network activity, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard PyQt GUI for icon browsing, utilizing qtawesome resources and internal functions for resource management. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The reliance on internal functions is typical for resource access but could be a minor concern if the library is compromised. No external network activity or suspicious behavior observed. The filtering, styling, and copying functionalities are implemented with standard Qt mechanisms. Overall, the code appears benign and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign icon browser utility with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security vulnerabilities. The use of internal qtawesome functions is typical for resource handling and does not indicate malicious behavior. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), primarily due to reliance on internal functions, which is acceptable in this context.",
