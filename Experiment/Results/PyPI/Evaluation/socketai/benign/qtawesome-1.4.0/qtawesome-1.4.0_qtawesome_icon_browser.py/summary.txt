  "conclusion": "The code is a benign icon browser utility with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security vulnerabilities. The use of internal qtawesome functions is typical for resource handling and does not indicate malicious behavior. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), primarily due to reliance on internal functions, which is acceptable in this context."
