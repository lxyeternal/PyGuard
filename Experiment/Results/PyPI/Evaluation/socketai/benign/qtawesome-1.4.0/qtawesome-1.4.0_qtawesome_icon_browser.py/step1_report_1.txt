{
  "purpose": "This script provides a graphical user interface for browsing, filtering, and copying icon identifiers from the QtAwesome library.",
  "sources": "Reads system input for GUI events, user input from line edits, combo boxes, and selection models; accesses system clipboard.",
  "sinks": "Copies icon identifier text to the system clipboard; possibly filters data for display; uses font resources from qtawesome resource cache.",
  "flows": "User input (filter text, font selection, columns change) -> updates proxy model filter -> displays icons; selected icon -> copies to clipboard.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. Uses standard Qt mechanisms; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a GUI application for icon browsing, filtering, and copying using Qt and qtawesome. It relies on standard Qt signals, slots, models, and views. It reads system data through GUI interactions and resource caches, and copies data to the clipboard. No network activity, no system modification, nor suspicious data handling is observed. The code structure appears typical for a PyQt5-based app with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign icon browser utility with no indications of malicious intent. It interacts solely with local resources and user inputs, and uses standard Qt and qtawesome libraries without any suspicious code or hidden functionalities.",
