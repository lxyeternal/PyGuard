  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code automates updating icon fonts (FontAwesome 6 and Codicons), downloading, extracting, renaming fonts, and patching hashes into source files. No malicious activity detected; relies on external sources, but this is typical.\n\n- **Security assessment:** No malware, backdoors, or obfuscation. The only concern is the reliance on external URLs, which is standard for such scripts.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — seems reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's behavior. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with focus on updating icon sets, downloading font and JSON data, and patching source files. No malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Security assessment:** No malware, obfuscation, or suspicious code. The use of regex for patching is standard, and network requests are to legitimate URLs.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, similar purpose—updating font assets, downloading, processing, and patching hashes. No malicious intent.\n\n- **Security assessment:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or backdoors. The code operates in a controlled manner, updating local files based on downloaded data.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriately scored.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—downloading font and JSON data, patching version hashes, no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Security assessment:** No malware or obfuscation. The code's reliance on external URLs is typical, and the operations are straightforward.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar functionality—downloading, renaming fonts, patching hashes. No malicious activity.\n\n- **Security assessment:** No malware, obfuscation, or suspicious code. The font renaming is standard for customization, and network requests are to official sources.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports consistently assign 0, which is justified. The code performs legitimate update tasks, with no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 across all reports, reflecting typical risks associated with downloading and modifying files from external sources but no active malicious intent.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear.\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** — minor risk due to external dependencies, but standard for update scripts.\n\n**Note:** The code is designed for legitimate asset management, with no indicators of supply chain compromise or malware.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe provided reports are consistent and reasonable. The scores accurately reflect the code's behavior and security posture. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\nThese align with the reports' conclusions and the code's operations.",
