{
  "purpose": "This code implements animation logic for a Qt widget, specifically for spinning and pulsing effects using QTimer.",
  "sources": "Reads the parent_widget (input widget), timer setup via QTimer, and data stored in self.info associated with parent_widget.",
  "sinks": "Calls to QTimer.start() and QTimer.stop() methods, and widget update/rendering via parent_widget.update() and painter transformations.",
  "flows": "Initialization of timers and animation parameters (source) leads to timer timeout triggering _update, which updates angles and repaints the widget.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, network calls, or data leaks. The code relies on standard PyQt functions; no obfuscated or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines Spin and Pulse classes for widget animations, managing QTimer instances for periodic updates. It manipulates angles and widget repainting to create visual effects. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code uses standard Qt functions for animation, with no suspicious or unusual code structures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of widget animation effects using PyQt, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
