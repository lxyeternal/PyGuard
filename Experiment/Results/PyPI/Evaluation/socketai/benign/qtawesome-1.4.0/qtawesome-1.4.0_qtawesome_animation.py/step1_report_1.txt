{
  "purpose": "The code appears to manage spinning and pulsing animations for a Qt widget, using timers to update visual states.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the parent_widget, self.info dictionary, and QTimer instances; accesses rectangle dimensions and painter transformations.",
  "sinks": "Updates widget via self.parent_widget.update(); uses QTimer to schedule callbacks; applies transformations with painter.translate and painter.rotate.",
  "flows": "Timer timeout triggers _update() which updates angle and calls widget update; setup method initializes timers and applies transformations; start and stop control timer execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or dynamic execution. No unusual or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code manages animation states for a widget, using QTimer to periodically update the rotation angle and trigger redraws. The parent_widget's update method is called to refresh visuals. The setup method configures the timer and applies transformations for drawing. No external inputs are processed, nor are there suspicious network or system interactions. The code appears standard for Qt widget animations, with no signs of malicious intent or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of widget animation handling with timers. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard, well-structured animation utility.",
