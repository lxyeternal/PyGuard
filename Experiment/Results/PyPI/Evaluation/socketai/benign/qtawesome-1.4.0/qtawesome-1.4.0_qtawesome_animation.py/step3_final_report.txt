{
  "purpose": "This code manages spinning and pulsing animations for Qt widgets using timers and transformations, updating angles and triggering repainting.",
  "sources": "Reads parent_widget, self.info dictionary, and rect parameters during setup and updates.",
  "sinks": "Calls parent_widget.update() to refresh the widget display.",
  "flows": "Timer timeout signals trigger _update(), which updates angles and calls update().",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors; straightforward animation logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of Qt widget animations, managing timers and transformations without external data, network activity, or obfuscation. No malicious or security-threatening patterns are present. The use of timers and transformations is typical for GUI effects and does not indicate malicious intent. The code is clear, well-structured, and free of anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. It performs standard animation tasks without external dependencies or malicious behaviors. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
