  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. It performs standard animation tasks without external dependencies or malicious behaviors. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
