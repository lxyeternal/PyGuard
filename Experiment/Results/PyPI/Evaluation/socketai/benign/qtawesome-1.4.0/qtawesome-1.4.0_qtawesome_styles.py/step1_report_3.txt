{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to apply dark and light themes to a Qt application by setting color palettes.",
  "sources": "Imports QPalette, QColor from qtpy.QtGui; uses hardcoded color values within functions.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no external data or untrusted inputs are processed or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; functions manipulate internal color settings without external data influence.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs observed. Functions straightforwardly set UI theme colors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard Qt classes and defines two functions to set themes. Both functions assign predefined color values to palette roles and apply the palette to the QApplication instance. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or external data handling is present. The code adheres to standard theming practices for PyQt applications and does not exhibit obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard theming utility for Qt applications with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It functions solely to set UI color schemes with hardcoded, benign color values.",
