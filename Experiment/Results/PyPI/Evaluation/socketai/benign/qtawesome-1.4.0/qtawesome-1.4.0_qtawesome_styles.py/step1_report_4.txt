  "purpose": "Provides functions to apply dark and light themes to a Qt application by setting color palettes.",
  "sources": "Imports from qtpy.QtGui (QPalette, QColor); function arguments (app).",
  "sinks": "app.style().unpolish(app); app.setPalette(); app.setStyle() – these modify application appearance but do not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Application instance passed to theme functions -> setColor calls -> application style updates.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The code primarily sets visual themes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines color palettes for dark and light themes, utilizing standard Qt classes and methods. No external input is processed, and no suspicious network or file operations are present. Functions modify the appearance of a QApplication instance based on predefined color schemes. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors are detected. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard theming procedures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign theming utility for Qt applications, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
