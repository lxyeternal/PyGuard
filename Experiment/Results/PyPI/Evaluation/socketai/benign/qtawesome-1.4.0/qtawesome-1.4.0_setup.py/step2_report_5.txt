  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script is a standard setup.py with no suspicious code or behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies the script as a typical setup configuration. It notes no malicious activity, code injection, or data leaks. The reasoning is sound, and the confidence is high.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights the use of `exec()` to read `_version.py`, which could be risky if the file is malicious. Slight concern about the execution of code during setup.\n- **Scores:** malware=0.1, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.7\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe key point is the use of `exec()` on a local file for version info. This is a common pattern but does pose a risk if `_version.py` is compromised. The report reasonably flags this as a potential security concern but considers the overall code benign.\n\n**Justification for scores:**  \n- Malware score: 0.1 is appropriate; the risk is minimal but non-zero due to `exec()`.\n- Security risk: 0.2 reflects some concern but not high.\n- Confidence: 0.7, since the risk depends on the trustworthiness of `_version.py`.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores seem reasonable. No significant issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, emphasizes the `exec()` on `_version.py` but finds no other suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly notes that the only potential issue is the `exec()` pattern, which is common but should be trusted. The overall code is standard.\n\n**Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0, since no malicious code is present.\n- Security risk: 0.1 is appropriate, acknowledging the `exec()` pattern.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the use of `exec()` for version info is flagged but considered typical.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nSame reasoning applies. The `exec()` pattern is standard but should be trusted.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the standard setup script with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAccurate. No malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- The main point of concern across multiple reports is the use of `exec()` to load version info from `_version.py`. While common, it can be risky if that file is malicious or tampered with.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious code is found in the setup script itself.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis: low malware and security risk, high confidence, and no obfuscation.\n\n### **My Final Estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — primarily due to the use of `exec()` on a local file, which could be risky if the file is compromised, but in a typical trusted environment, this is standard practice.\n\n**Note:** The actual risk hinges on the trustworthiness of `_version.py`. If this file is verified and unaltered, the risk remains minimal.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard setup script with a minor concern about the use of `exec()` for version loading. No malware or obfuscation is present. The scores in the reports are appropriate given the evidence.",
