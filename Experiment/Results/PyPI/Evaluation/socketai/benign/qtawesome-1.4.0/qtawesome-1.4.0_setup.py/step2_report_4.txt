  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Summary:** Standard setup script, no suspicious code or malicious activity.  \n- **Key points:** No data leaks, no code execution beyond normal setup, high confidence.  \n- **Assessment:** The report is accurate. The code is straightforward, and no malicious behavior is evident.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Summary:** Identifies the use of `exec()` to read `_version.py` as a potential risk.  \n- **Key points:** The `exec()` call could execute malicious code if `_version.py` is compromised.  \n- **Analysis:** This is a valid concern; `exec()` is risky if the executed file is malicious. However, in typical package setups, `_version.py` is a controlled, benign file.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.1, Risk = 0.2 — reasonable, given the potential for malicious code execution if the version file is tampered with.  \n- **Justification for risk:** Since `exec()` can run arbitrary code, if an attacker compromised `_version.py`, they could execute malicious code during installation.  \n- **Conclusion:** The concern is valid but conditional on the trustworthiness of `_version.py`. The overall risk is low but non-zero.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to others, notes the use of `exec()` but considers it typical.  \n- **Key points:** No network activity, no malicious code, standard setup.  \n- **Analysis:** The use of `exec()` is common but should be noted as a potential risk if the version file is compromised.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 — reasonable.  \n- **Conclusion:** The assessment aligns with standard practices; the risk is minimal but present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Summary:** Reiterates the standard setup pattern, emphasizing the use of `exec()` for version info.  \n- **Key points:** No malicious activity, standard package setup, common pattern.  \n- **Analysis:** The use of `exec()` remains the main point of concern, but it's a well-known pattern.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 — appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** The script is typical, with a minor risk associated with `exec()`.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Summary:** Confirms the script is standard, with no malicious intent.  \n- **Key points:** No suspicious behaviors, no obfuscation, no external untrusted data.  \n- **Analysis:** The code is straightforward, and the use of `exec()` is typical for version extraction.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis & Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign a 0 or near-zero malware score. The only point of concern is the use of `exec()` to load `_version.py`. While this is common, it does pose a risk if the `_version.py` file is malicious or tampered with.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and not obfuscated.  \n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1 or 0.2) in some reports, which is justified due to the `exec()` pattern. The risk is conditional on the trustworthiness of `_version.py`.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- The code itself appears benign and follows standard practices.  \n- The primary concern is the use of `exec()` to load version info, which could be exploited if the `_version.py` file is malicious or compromised.  \n- No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected, just a standard setup script.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Risk score:** **0.2** — due to the `exec()` pattern, which is common but could be risky if the version file is compromised.\n\n**Summary:** The setup script is typical, with a minor potential security concern related to executing code from a local version file. Ensuring the integrity of `_version.py` mitigates this risk.",
