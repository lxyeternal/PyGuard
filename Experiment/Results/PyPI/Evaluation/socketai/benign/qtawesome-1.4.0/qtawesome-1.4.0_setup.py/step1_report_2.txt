  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for the 'QtAwesome' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and custom build commands.",
  "sources": "Reading files: 'qtawesome/_version.py' for version info, 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "Potentially executing code from '_version.py' via exec(), calling setup() which may trigger build/install scripts.",
  "flows": "exec() reads version data -> setup() initiates installation process which may invoke custom commands like 'update_fa6' or 'update_msc'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to run code from '_version.py' could execute arbitrary code if the file is malicious or tampered with. No other suspicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup procedures for a Python package, with version info dynamically loaded via exec() from '_version.py'. The exec() call is a potential risk if '_version.py' is malicious. All other code appears to be standard package metadata and configuration. No network connections, data leaks, or suspicious code segments are present. The custom commands in 'cmdclass' reference external modules, but this is typical for package setup scripts. The code itself is not obfuscated and follows standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The main concern is the use of exec() to execute version code from '_version.py'. If this file is malicious or compromised, it could lead to arbitrary code execution during installation. Otherwise, the script appears benign and standard for a setup.py file.",
