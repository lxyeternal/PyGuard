  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, potential security issues, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard setup script; no suspicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No untrusted data sinks; code executes standard setup procedures.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, justified by the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The script performs typical packaging tasks with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights the use of `exec()` to load version info from `_version.py`.\n- **Findings:** Use of `exec()` could be risky if `_version.py` is malicious.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Risk is 0.2, malware is 0.1.\n- **Justification:** The `exec()` call is a common pattern but can be exploited if `_version.py` is compromised. The low malware score reflects that there's no direct malicious code, but the potential risk exists if the version file is malicious.\n- **Assessment:** The scores seem reasonable. The main concern is the `exec()` pattern, which is a known security consideration in setup scripts.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others; standard setup with `exec()` for version info.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code or malicious activity.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Risk 0.1, malware 0.\n- **Justification:** The use of `exec()` is typical but should be noted. No malicious behavior is observed.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The low risk score is appropriate given the context.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the standard setup process with `exec()` for version.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity; common pattern.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Risk 0.1, malware 0.\n- **Justification:** Same reasoning as above; `exec()` is a known pattern but not inherently malicious.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard package setup; no suspicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No external data flows or malicious code.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both 0.\n- **Justification:** No security concerns identified.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- The primary concern across multiple reports is the use of `exec()` to load version info from `_version.py`. While this is a common pattern, it can pose security risks if `_version.py` is malicious or tampered with.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present in the code.\n- The scores assigned in the reports align with the analysis; the small risk and malware scores reflect the potential but unconfirmed risk associated with `exec()`.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Malware Score:**  \n- The code itself does not perform any malicious actions. The only potential vector is the `exec()` on `_version.py`. Given that this file is part of the package and presumably controlled, the malware score should remain very low or zero unless `_version.py` is compromised.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:**  \n- The code is clear, readable, and not obfuscated.\n\n**Risk Score:**  \n- Slightly elevated due to the use of `exec()`, but still low because no malicious code is present. A score of around **0.1–0.2** seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Estimate                     | Justification                                                                 |\n|-----------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0                                   | No malicious code; `exec()` is a pattern, not an attack vector per se.     |\n| Obfuscated      | 0                                   | Clear, readable code.                                                        |\n| Security Risk   | 0.1–0.2                             | Slight risk due to `exec()`, but no evidence of malicious intent.          |\n\n**Overall, the code appears benign with a minor security consideration regarding the version file execution.**",
