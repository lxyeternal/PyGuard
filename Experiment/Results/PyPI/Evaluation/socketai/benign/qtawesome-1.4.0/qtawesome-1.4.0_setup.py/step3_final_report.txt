  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the QtAwesome Python package, defining package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading '_version.py' for version info, reading 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks or external data flows are present.",
  "flows": "Reading '_version.py' and executing its content via exec() to assign version; reading README.md content.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to load version info from '_version.py' could be risky if the file is malicious or tampered with.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup tasks, including reading version info and description, and configuring setup parameters. The use of exec() to execute '_version.py' is a common pattern but introduces a potential security risk if the file is compromised. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The rest of the script is straightforward and typical for Python packaging. The risk associated with exec() is minimal if the source is trusted, but it remains a vector if the file is malicious. Scores reflect this: malware score of 0.1 to 0.2, obfuscation score of 0, and a low security risk score, consistent with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign and standard, with a minor security consideration due to the use of exec() on a local version file. No evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation is present. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
