  "purpose": "Font management, icon creation, and font integrity verification for PyQt/PySide applications.",
  "sources": "Font files read from disk, MD5 hash verification, icon and font data loaded into application.",
  "sinks": "Creation of QIcon, QPixmap, and QFont objects for GUI display; reading font files locally.",
  "flows": "Font files are read, hashed, and validated; icons are generated based on font data and user input; no external network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected. MD5 hash checks serve as security measures to prevent tampered fonts.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard resource management for fonts and icons, with security best practices like MD5 hash validation to ensure font integrity. It does not contain dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation. The logic is straightforward, focusing on loading, verifying, and providing access to font resources. No malicious patterns or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, security-conscious font and icon management utility with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with its behavior and security posture.",
