      "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low malware and obfuscation scores. Reports highlighting dynamic code execution and network activity suggest moderate to high risk, warranting slightly increased malware scores (around 0.5). Obfuscation remains low unless explicitly observed. Overall, the assessments are consistent with the behaviors described, with some room for minor score adjustments based on confirmed malicious patterns."
