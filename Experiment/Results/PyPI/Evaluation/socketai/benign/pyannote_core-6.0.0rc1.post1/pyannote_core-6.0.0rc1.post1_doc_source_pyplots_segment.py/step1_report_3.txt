  "purpose": "Configure plot settings, crop a segment, and plot a specific segment with time axis.",
  "sources": "Assignment of plotting parameters, creation of Segment object, method call to plot_segment",
  "sinks": "None that involve untrusted data or external effects",
  "flows": "Plot configuration and segment cropping do not process external or untrusted data; no data flows involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious or unusual code patterns. Use of undefined classes like Segment suggests dependencies, but no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code sets figure width, defines a crop segment, and plots a segment within specified time bounds. All functions are standard plotting and data segment operations. No data is read from external untrusted sources, no malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks are present. The code appears to be part of a visualization setup, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard plot configuration and visualization tasks without any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign snippet intended for data visualization purposes.",
