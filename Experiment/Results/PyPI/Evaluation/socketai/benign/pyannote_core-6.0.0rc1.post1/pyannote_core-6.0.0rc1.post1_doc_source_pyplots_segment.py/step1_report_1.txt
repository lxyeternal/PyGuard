{
  "purpose": "The code appears to configure plot settings and visualize a specific segment of data within a notebook environment.",
  "sources": "Assignment of figure width, setting plot parameters, creation of a segment object, and calling the plot_segment method with the segment object.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no data is sent to external systems, files, or network connections.",
  "flows": "Configuration settings (notebook.width, plt.rcParams) -> creation of Segment objects -> plotting via notebook.plot_segment.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded values appear standard for plotting, and no obfuscated code or dynamic code execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets visual parameters for plotting, defines segments for visualization, and calls plotting functions. It does not include any suspicious or malicious actions such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection. All values are hardcoded and related to plot configuration. No hidden or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard plot configuration and visualization tasks without any indication of malicious intent or security risks. It is a typical visualization setup with no suspicious activity.",
