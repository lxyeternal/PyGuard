  "sources": "notebook.width, plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'], notebook.crop, Segment(0, 20), Segment(5, 15), notebook.plot_segment, plt.show()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs; plotting functions display data locally.",
  "flows": "Configuration of figure size and crop segment -> creation of segment object -> plotting segment -> display plot",
  "anomalies": "Use of undefined objects (`notebook`, `Segment`) but typical in larger codebases; no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code configures plot parameters, defines a segment, and visualizes it within a notebook environment. No external data input, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. The undefined objects suggest reliance on a larger, legitimate framework. No malicious or suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are detected. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The code performs standard visualization tasks with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign visualization snippet with no malicious behavior or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
