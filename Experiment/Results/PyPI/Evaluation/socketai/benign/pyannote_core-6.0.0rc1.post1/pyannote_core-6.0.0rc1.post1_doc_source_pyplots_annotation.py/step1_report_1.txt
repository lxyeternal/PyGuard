  "purpose": "Configure plot settings and add annotations for a visualization within a specific time segment.",
  "sources": "Assignment of notebook.width, cropping segment, creation and assignment of annotations, plotting annotations.",
  "sinks": "plt.show() - renders the plot; no other sinks present.",
  "flows": "Set plot parameters -> define crop segment -> create annotations -> assign segments -> plot annotations -> display plot.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code patterns. No use of dynamic execution or obfuscated code. The code appears to be standard plotting configuration and annotation setup.",
  "analysis": "The code sets visualization parameters, defines a crop segment, creates annotations for specific segments, plots the annotations with a legend, and displays the plot. All operations are related to visualization setup with no suspicious data handling, input/output manipulation, or malicious constructs identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard plot configuration and annotation tasks without any suspicious or malicious behavior. It appears to be a normal visualization setup script.",
