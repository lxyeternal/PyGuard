  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of each report:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard package initialization script, defining constants, importing modules, handling optional dependencies, and retrieving package version info.\n- No evidence of data flow from untrusted sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.\n- The only minor variation is the confidence level, but all are high (mostly 1.0 or 0.9), indicating strong agreement that the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in the code?**  \n  No. The code appears straightforward, with no signs of malicious logic, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No evident errors or flaws. The code uses standard practices for optional imports and version retrieval.\n\n- **Scores assigned?**  \n  All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n- **Risk scores?**  \n  All reports assign very low or zero security risk, which aligns with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  Since there's no malicious activity—no code injection, data exfiltration, network activity, or suspicious behaviors—the malware score should remain at **0**.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  The code is clear, with no obfuscation patterns. The score should be **0**.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  Given the absence of vulnerabilities, the risk score should be **0**.\n\n- **Potential for false positives or assumptions:**  \n  The reports correctly avoid assumptions about malicious intent; they recognize the code as standard library setup.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the provided code and reports, the overall scores should be:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated:** **0**  \n- **Risk:** **0**\n\nThis aligns with the consensus that the code is benign, standard setup code with no malicious or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a typical, benign library initialization script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current report scores are accurate, and I concur with their assessments.",
