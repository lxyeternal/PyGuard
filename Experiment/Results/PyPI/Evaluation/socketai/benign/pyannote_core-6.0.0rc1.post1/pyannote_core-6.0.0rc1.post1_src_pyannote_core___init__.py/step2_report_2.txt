  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is a standard Python package initialization script.\n- It defines constants, imports local modules, handles optional dependencies, and retrieves package version info.\n- No user input, network activity, file operations, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The only dynamic aspect is the optional import of `.notebook`, which is handled safely.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed review of each report:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** No malicious behavior; standard setup.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent. No issues.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Same as above; standard package setup.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No concerns.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Similar benign description.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Slightly lower confidence (0.9), with a small securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly overcautious. The code does not perform any risky operations. The minor securityRisk score might be overly conservative. I would recommend setting it to 0 unless there's a specific concern.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Similar benign setup.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Key points:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated:** All correctly assign 0; code is clear.\n- **Security risk:** Only Report 4 assigns a small risk (0.1). Given the code's static nature, this is unwarranted. I suggest lowering this to 0 for consistency.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** for all reports — accurate.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** for all — accurate.\n- **Security risk:** \n  - For reports 1-3 and 5: **0** — accurate.\n  - For report 4: **0** — more appropriate, as no real risk exists.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security concerns)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nAll reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code. The only minor point is the securityRisk score in report 4, which should be adjusted to 0. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly assigned as 0 across all reports.\n\n**Final note:** The code is a typical, safe library initialization script with no malicious or security issues.",
