{
  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize a Python package related to audio or timeline annotation, setting constants, importing modules, and configuring versioning.",
  "sources": "Import statements, variable assignments, and module imports. No external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external systems, files, or network are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily sets constants and imports modules.",
  "anomalies": "The import of 'importlib.metadata' is standard; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected. The conditional import with exception handling is common for optional modules.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly defines constants, imports submodules, and retrieves version info. It includes a try-except block for optional notebook import. The use of 'importlib.metadata.version' is standard for package versioning. No data input, no network calls, no code execution from untrusted sources, or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package initialization script with no malicious or security concern indications. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks based on its content.",
