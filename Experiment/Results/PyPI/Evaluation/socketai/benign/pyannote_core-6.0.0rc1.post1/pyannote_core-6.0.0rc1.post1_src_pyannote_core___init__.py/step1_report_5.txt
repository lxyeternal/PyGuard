{
  "purpose": "This code appears to set up constants, import modules, and configure classes related to audio/video segmentation and annotation, likely for a multimedia processing library.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version() to retrieve package version, and local imports from the package's submodules (.segment, .timeline, .annotation, .feature, optionally .notebook).",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted input or data. No data leaks, network operations, or external command executions are present.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is detected.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The code primarily sets constants, performs safe module imports, and calls a class method.",
  "analysis": "The script defines string constants for labels, imports classes from internal modules, and conditionally imports a notebook module. It also sets a precision configuration and retrieves the package version via importlib.metadata. The try-except block around the notebook import is a standard pattern to handle optional dependencies. The code runs only static configurations and safe imports, with no dynamic execution, network activity, or data processing that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical initialization and setup script for a multimedia processing library. It contains no suspicious or malicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or external communications. The only notable point is the use of importlib.metadata to obtain the package version, which is a standard practice.",
