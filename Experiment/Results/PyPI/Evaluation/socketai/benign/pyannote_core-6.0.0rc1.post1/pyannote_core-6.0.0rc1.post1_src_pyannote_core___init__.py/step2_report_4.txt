  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issues present?** No. The code is a straightforward library setup script with constants, imports, and version retrieval.  \n- **Errors/flaws?** None identified.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. The scores seem appropriate given the benign nature.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or suspicious patterns. The use of try-except for optional import is standard.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issues present?** No. Similar to Report 1, it’s a typical initialization script.  \n- **Errors/flaws?** None.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.  \n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious behavior.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issues present?** No. Again, standard setup code.  \n- **Errors/flaws?** None.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. The confidence is high, and the assessment aligns with the code.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious activity detected.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issues present?** No. Similar pattern—constants, safe imports, version retrieval.  \n- **Errors/flaws?** None.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1. Slightly above zero risk, but given the code’s static nature, this is acceptable.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious intent; the minor risk score could reflect general caution but is not indicative of actual issues.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issues present?** No. Standard initialization with safe practices.  \n- **Errors/flaws?** None.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign a 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code or behavior.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent; the code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Risk score:** All are at or near 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code. The only slight increase (0.1) in one report is reasonable given the general caution, but not indicative of actual risk.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores across all reports are consistent and justified based on the code provided.  \n- No modifications are necessary.  \n- The code appears to be a standard, benign library initialization script with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0 (or very close to zero, e.g., 0.05, but 0 is acceptable)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a typical, safe setup script for a multimedia annotation library, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
