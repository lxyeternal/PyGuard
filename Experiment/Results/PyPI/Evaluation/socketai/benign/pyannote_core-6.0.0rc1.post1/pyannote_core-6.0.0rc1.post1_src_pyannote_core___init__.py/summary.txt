  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals and reports correctly assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as zero. The minimal risk score in one report (0.1) should be adjusted to 0 for consistency. Overall, the code is safe and poses no security threat."
