{
  "purpose": "This code appears to set up constants and import modules related to a multimedia or annotation library, likely for speech or audio processing, with no explicit malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Imports from importlib.metadata, relative imports of modules (.segment, .timeline, .annotation, .feature, and optionally .notebook). Constants defined with string values.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data or user input; no network, file, or system commands executed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; no dynamic data handling or untrusted data processing present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. The optional import of notebook module is a benign attempt to enhance functionality if available.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines constants, imports modules, and sets a version using standard library functions. The try-except block for optional notebook import is standard practice. No malicious functions, no external network activity, and no sensitive data handling are present. The code is well-structured and uses common patterns for Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and appears to be part of a legitimate open-source library for multimedia or annotation tasks. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are identified.",
