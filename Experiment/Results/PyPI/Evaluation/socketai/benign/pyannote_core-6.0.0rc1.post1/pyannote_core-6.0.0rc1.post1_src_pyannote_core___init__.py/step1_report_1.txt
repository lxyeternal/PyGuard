{
  "purpose": "The code initializes constants, imports modules, and sets up classes and functions related to a multimedia or annotation processing library, likely for audio/video annotation tasks.",
  "sources": "Environment for importlib.metadata, local modules (.segment, .timeline, .annotation, .feature, .notebook), and setting of constants.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; no network or file output based on provided code.",
  "flows": "Constants and imported modules are initialized; no data flow from untrusted sources to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic execution. The code appears standard for a library setup with proper import handling.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly sets up constants, imports from local modules, and handles optional notebook import. It retrieves package version information via importlib.metadata. No user input, environment variables, or network operations are present. There are no signs of malicious logic such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The try-except around the notebook import is standard for optional dependencies. Overall, the code appears to be a typical, benign library initialization script with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard library setup script with no malicious behavior detected. It performs typical imports and configuration for a multimedia annotation toolkit, with no suspicious or harmful code present.",
