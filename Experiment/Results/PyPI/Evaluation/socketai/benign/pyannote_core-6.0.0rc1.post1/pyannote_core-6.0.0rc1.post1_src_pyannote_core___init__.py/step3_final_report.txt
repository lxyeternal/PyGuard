  "purpose": "Initialize the pyannote-core library by defining constants, importing modules, and retrieving version info.",
  "sources": "Constants definitions, import statements, importlib.metadata.version, optional import of .notebook",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no network or file operations",
  "flows": "Constants and imports are static; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, standard setup code",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard library initialization script with constants, module imports, optional dependency handling, and version retrieval. It contains no user input, network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. The optional import is safely handled. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are present. The code's simplicity and clarity indicate benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals and reports correctly assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as zero. The minimal risk score in one report (0.1) should be adjusted to 0 for consistency. Overall, the code is safe and poses no security threat.",
