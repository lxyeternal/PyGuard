  "purpose": "A comprehensive Timeline class for managing ordered, non-overlapping segments with methods for addition, removal, cropping, serialization, visualization, and support calculation.",
  "sources": "Reads segment data from parameters, DataFrame, or external files; uses standard libraries and local modules; no untrusted input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include string serialization, file writing, and visualization; no network or external data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Data flows are typical for data management: input parameters to internal data structures, outputs to files or strings; no suspicious data paths.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected. The code is well-structured and uses standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a well-structured class for managing temporal segments, with standard methods for set operations, serialization, and visualization. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. It relies on common libraries and local modules, with no network activity or dynamic code execution. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, low risk) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, open-source timeline management class with no detectable malicious intent or sabotage. It performs expected operations for segment processing, with no suspicious or malicious behavior observed. The malware and obfuscated scores should be 0, and the overall security risk remains very low (~0.05).",
