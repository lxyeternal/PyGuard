{
  "purpose": "The code implements a domain-specific class for managing multimedia annotations, tracks, labels, and segments, providing methods for filtering, serialization, relabeling, and cropping of annotations.",
  "sources": "Input data from pandas DataFrames, record iterators, and parameters such as segments, tracks, labels, and support structures.",
  "sinks": "Serialization outputs to RTTM and LAB text formats, and file writing functions; no network or external command execution involved.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input data structures into internal dictionaries and timelines, then into serialized string outputs or files; no external untrusted data or dynamic code execution is present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. The code is well-structured, documented, and licensed, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code manages annotation data through internal sorted dictionaries and timelines, providing methods for filtering, relabeling, cropping, and serialization. It reads data from trusted sources like DataFrames and records, and writes outputs to standard formats. No network activity, dynamic code execution, or insecure handling is present. The code's clarity and licensing suggest transparency. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are identified. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: ~0.1) are consistent with the code's functionality and security profile.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, domain-specific annotation management class with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, and a very low security risk are justified and should be maintained.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
