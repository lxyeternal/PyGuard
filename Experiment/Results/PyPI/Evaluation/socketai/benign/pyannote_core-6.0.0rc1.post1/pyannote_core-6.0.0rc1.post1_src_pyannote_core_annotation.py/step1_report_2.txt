{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python class 'Annotation' for managing annotated segments, labels, and tracks in audio/video resources, supporting operations like cropping, support merging, relabeling, serialization, and comparison.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from method parameters (e.g., segments, labels, files), class attributes (e.g., _tracks, _labels), and external data sources when using from_df method, as well as itertracks, itersegments, and support functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include file writing methods (write_rttm, write_lab), which output formatted strings to external files, and data serialization functions that generate string representations. No direct dangerous data sink such as network or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (e.g., segments, labels, DataFrames) into internal data structures (_tracks, _labels), through operations like copying, filtering, relabeling, or cropping. Serialization functions convert internal data into formatted strings. No external data is transferred over networks or executed as code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors detected. The code employs standard Python libraries and structured methods for data management. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are present. No dynamic execution or code injection mechanisms are used. The import of pandas is conditional, only if TYPE_CHECKING. No signs of malicious privacy violations or data theft are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a well-structured, domain-specific implementation for managing annotations in multimedia resources. It uses safe data structures, employs serialization for external data export, and provides methods for filtering, relabeling, and support calculation. There are no indications of malicious intent, hidden backdoors, or malicious data transmission. The only external interactions involve writing data to files or producing string representations, which are common in data processing libraries. The absence of network operations, dynamic code execution, or secret handling suggests a low likelihood of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a secure, domain-appropriate class for annotation management with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. Its operations are limited to data handling, filtering, relabeling, and serialization within the local environment. No malicious code, backdoors, or dangerous external interactions are present.",
