  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the code in question.\n\n**Overall Code Content:**\n- The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file for generating project documentation.\n- It includes typical imports (`os`, `sys`, `pyannote.core`), path modifications, and configuration variables.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling beyond configuration.\n- Variables like `plot_pre_code` and `ipython_savefig_dir` are benign strings for plotting setup.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or secrets.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of malicious or suspicious code:** None. All code is static, standard, and intended for documentation setup.\n- **Code behavior:** It only sets configuration parameters; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None. No external network calls, file writes (beyond static configuration), or code execution based on untrusted input.\n- **Malware indicators:** Absent. No malicious functions, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports.\n\n### Analysis of Each Report:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as a typical Sphinx configuration with no malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned (`malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`) are appropriate.\n- The confidence levels are high, given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 is correct; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 is correct; code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 is correct; no security risks are present.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- The code is a legitimate configuration script.\n- No evidence suggests malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The reports are consistent with this assessment.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, standard, and poses no security threat. All reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
