  "purpose": "This code is a configuration script for setting up Sphinx documentation for the pyannote.core project.",
  "sources": "Imports os, sys, and pyannote.core; modifies sys.path; sets configuration variables for extensions, themes, and project info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows; no network or file I/O beyond static configuration; no sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "Static import and configuration variables; no dynamic or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward and standard for documentation setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Sphinx configuration file with standard imports, path modifications, and configuration variables. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling from untrusted sources. Variables like plot_pre_code and ipython_savefig_dir are benign strings. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or secrets are present. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the benign, static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard configuration script for documentation generation. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
