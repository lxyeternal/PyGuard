  "purpose": "Configuration and setup for building documentation using Sphinx for the pyannote.core project.",
  "sources": "sys.path.insert, import statements (os, sys, pyannote.core), string variables, comments.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly handles untrusted input or data streams; no external data or network interactions are present.",
  "flows": "The code primarily sets up environment variables and configuration parameters; no data flow from sources to sinks is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or malicious patterns detected. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file with imports, path modifications, extension lists, and documentation settings. There are no signs of malicious activity, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection. The imports and variables are all related to documentation generation. All code appears benign and consistent with normal setup routines.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a legitimate configuration script for documentation building. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious anomalies, and no security risks. The overall security risk is negligible.",
