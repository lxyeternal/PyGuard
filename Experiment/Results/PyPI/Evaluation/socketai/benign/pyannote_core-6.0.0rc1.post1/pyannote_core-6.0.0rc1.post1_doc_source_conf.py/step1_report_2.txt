  "purpose": "Configuration file for building documentation for the 'pyannote.core' project using Sphinx.",
  "sources": "Imports os, sys modules, modifies sys.path, and defines Sphinx configuration variables and settings.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data; the code primarily sets configuration parameters and imports modules.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows indicating malicious activity; data flows are limited to configuration setup and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. The code is standard for Sphinx documentation configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Sphinx documentation configuration file, setting extensions, paths, and project metadata. It imports modules necessary for documentation generation and adjusts system paths. No functions, network calls, or code execution based on untrusted input are present. The code is static and appears safe. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malware behavior are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard Sphinx configuration script for project documentation, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
