  "purpose": "This code is a configuration file for building documentation using Sphinx for the 'pyannote.core' project.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries (os, sys), and the code itself is static configuration data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present. No data input/output operations or network calls are detected.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow paths involving untrusted data; the code primarily sets configuration parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior observed. The import statements and configuration parameters are typical for a Sphinx documentation setup.",
  "analysis": "The script configures various aspects of Sphinx documentation, including extensions, themes, paths, project metadata, and output options. The import statements are standard, and no code execution or external data handling occurs beyond setting up the environment. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. All content appears to be legitimate configuration data.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard Sphinx documentation configuration file with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It serves purely to set up documentation build parameters.",
