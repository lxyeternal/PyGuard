  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard Sphinx configuration script.\n- No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is found.\n- Imports are standard (`os`, `sys`, `pyannote.core`), and modifications to `sys.path` are typical in documentation setups.\n- No network activity, file I/O beyond static configuration, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- Variables like `plot_pre_code` and `ipython_savefig_dir` are benign strings for plotting and static paths.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis: malware and obfuscated are 0, and overall security risk is 0.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code is purely configuration, with no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors are present.\n- The imports and setup are typical for a documentation build process.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The reports are accurate; the code is benign.\n- The scores are appropriate: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.\n- The confidence level of 1 is justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Based on all evidence, I concur with the assessments.\n- I would assign the following scores:\n  - **Malware:** 0\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0\n  - **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code is a standard, safe configuration script for Sphinx documentation generation. No malicious activity or security issues are present.",
