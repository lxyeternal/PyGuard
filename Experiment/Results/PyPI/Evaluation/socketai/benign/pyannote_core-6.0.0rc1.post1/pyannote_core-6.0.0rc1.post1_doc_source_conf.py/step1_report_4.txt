  "purpose": "Configuration script for building documentation using Sphinx for the pyannote.core project.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (os, sys, pyannote.core), sets sys.path, defines configuration variables and strings.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output; no external network calls, database access, or command execution detected.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted data; script only sets configuration variables and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior present. The code is a standard Sphinx configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries and the pyannote.core package, then sets various configuration options for Sphinx documentation generation. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or data leaks. The 'plot_pre_code' and 'ipython_savefig_dir' variables are benign strings defining plotting code and a directory path. No evidence of malicious intent or malicious code patterns. The code is consistent with typical documentation configuration scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration file for Sphinx documentation generation, containing no malicious behavior, no security risks, and no obfuscation. It is safe and does not pose any security threat.",
