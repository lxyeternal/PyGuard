  "purpose": "Configuration setup for generating project documentation using Sphinx for the pyannote.core Python package.",
  "sources": "Import statements (`os`, `sys`, and `pyannote.core`), sys.path modification, and variable assignments related to documentation configuration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs that could be exploited; no network calls, file writes, or sensitive data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code primarily sets configuration parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated/malicious code. All imports and configurations appear standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx documentation configuration file, setting up extensions, themes, paths, and project info. It includes imports of standard libraries and 'pyannote.core' for version info, which are typical for this context. No suspicious functions, dynamic code execution, or external network activity are present. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code constructs are detected. The import statements and path manipulations are common in documentation projects.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical configuration script for project documentation generation with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and aligns with standard practices.",
