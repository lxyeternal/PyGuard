{
  "purpose": "The code provides a function for tokenizing text into phrases of specified length, primarily for text mining and word frequency analysis.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'text_list' (list of strings or a single string), and the imported 'WORD_DELIM' from the regex module.",
  "sinks": "The function does not write to any external data sources, network, or perform any output operations. No sinks that could lead to data leaks or side effects are present.",
  "flows": "The data flows from the input 'text_list' through processing steps: normalization to lowercase, splitting into words, stripping delimiters, then assembling phrases of length 'phrase_len'. No untrusted data output or external communication occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses an external 'WORD_DELIM' for stripping delimiters, which could potentially be manipulated if 'WORD_DELIM' is compromised, but this is unlikely as it is an imported constant. The logic appears straightforward without obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The function checks if 'text_list' is a string and converts it into a list to standardize processing. It splits each string into words, converts to lowercase, strips delimiters using 'WORD_DELIM', and then creates overlapping phrases of length 'phrase_len'. There are no external side effects, network calls, or code injections. The code does not perform any dangerous or malicious actions. It operates purely as a text processing utility with no evidence of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard text tokenization utility intended for linguistic processing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It is a benign helper function with no security risks.",
