{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to tokenize a list of text strings into phrases of specified word lengths, mainly for text analysis tasks like word or phrase frequency.",
  "sources": "Input is received through the `text_list` parameter, which can be a string or list of strings.",
  "sinks": "The code processes the input internally; it does not write to external systems, send data over a network, or access environment variables. No sinks indicating malicious data exfiltration or external communication are present.",
  "flows": "Input text is converted into lowercase, split into words, stripped of delimiters, then recombined into phrases of specified length; no external data flows or outputs are involved beyond returning the tokenized list.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, unusual code constructs, or misleading variable names. The code performs straightforward tokenization and string processing.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a delimiter from a local module, processes input that can be string or list, normalizes text to lowercase, splits on whitespace, strips delimiters from words, and creates phrase sequences. It includes detailed docstrings with examples. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated parts, or suspicious logic are present. The code is consistent with standard text tokenization functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard text tokenization utility with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It performs typical string processing tasks securely and transparently. There are no signs of malware, data leakage, or malicious activity.",
