  "purpose": "A utility function to tokenize text into n-grams by splitting on whitespace and stripping delimiters.",
  "sources": "Input list of strings, external WORD_DELIM regex pattern used for stripping delimiters.",
  "sinks": "None; the code processes data in-memory without external outputs or side effects.",
  "flows": "Input text -> split into words -> strip delimiters -> generate n-grams of specified length.",
  "anomalies": "Use of external WORD_DELIM regex pattern; no malicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward string splitting, delimiter stripping, and n-gram creation. No network, file, or system modifications are present. The reliance on WORD_DELIM is standard for delimiter patterns. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code is well-documented and transparent. External dependency is assumed safe; no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard text tokenization utility with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
