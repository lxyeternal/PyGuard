{
  "purpose": "This code provides a function to tokenize text into phrases of specified length for text analysis tasks such as word frequency counting.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the parameter 'text_list', which can be a string or list of strings.",
  "sinks": "None present; the code does not write to files, send data over the network, or invoke system commands.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed by splitting into words, stripping delimiters, and recombining into phrases; no external or untrusted data flows to external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code performs standard text tokenization with delimiter stripping; no obfuscated or malicious code structures.",
  "analysis": "The function begins by converting string input into a list, then splits each string into lowercase words. It strips delimiters from each word using a constant 'WORD_DELIM'. It then constructs phrases of specified length by joining consecutive words. There are no external calls, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behaviors. The code is straightforward and intended for text preprocessing without any signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign text tokenization utility designed for natural language processing tasks. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It performs standard operations safely.",
