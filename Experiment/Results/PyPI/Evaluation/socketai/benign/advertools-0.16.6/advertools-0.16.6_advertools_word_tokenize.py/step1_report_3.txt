{
  "purpose": "The code provides a utility function for tokenizing text into n-grams of specified length, primarily for text analysis and processing tasks.",
  "sources": "Input is taken from the parameter `text_list`, which can be a string or a list of strings. The code reads this input data directly from function arguments.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to external sources, files, or network destinations. It primarily processes and returns tokenized text data within the program's scope.",
  "flows": "Input data from `text_list` is processed: converted to lowercase, split into words, stripped of delimiters, then grouped into n-grams based on `phrase_len`. The flow ends with returning the tokenized list of n-grams.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code performs straightforward text processing. It relies on an external module `regex` for `WORD_DELIM`, which appears to be a standard delimiter pattern. No obfuscated code, hidden behaviors, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The function is well-documented and uses standard Python string methods for splitting and stripping. The input handling accommodates both string and list inputs, converting strings into lists. It uses list comprehensions for clean and efficient processing. The core logic is simple: normalize case, split words, strip delimiters, then generate n-grams. There are no external side effects, network operations, or data leaks. The use of `WORD_DELIM` from an external module is assumed to be benign and standard for delimiter patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for tokenizing text into n-grams and contains no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is standard text processing code with no evident malicious intent or suspicious operations.",
