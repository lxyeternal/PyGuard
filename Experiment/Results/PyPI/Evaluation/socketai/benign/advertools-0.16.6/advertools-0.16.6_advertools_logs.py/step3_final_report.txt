  "purpose": "Parse and analyze server logs into pandas DataFrames, convert to Parquet, and perform data enrichment such as reverse DNS lookup, URL parsing, and user agent analysis for detailed log insights.",
  "sources": "Log files, regex parsing, URL components, reverse DNS lookup, user agent parsing",
  "sinks": "Parquet files, error logs, enriched DataFrames with hostname and URL components",
  "flows": "Regex extraction from log lines -> DataFrame creation -> data type conversions -> DNS lookup -> URL and user agent parsing -> concatenation and saving",
  "anomalies": "No credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious code detected; standard log processing pipeline",
  "analysis": "The code employs regex-based parsing for multiple log formats, handles errors gracefully, performs external DNS lookups, and enriches data with URL and user agent details. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. External DNS lookups involve network activity but are typical for hostname resolution. The code is clear, well-structured, and uses standard libraries without obfuscation or dynamic code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured log analysis utility with no malicious intent. The external DNS lookups are standard and do not indicate malicious activity. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior.",
