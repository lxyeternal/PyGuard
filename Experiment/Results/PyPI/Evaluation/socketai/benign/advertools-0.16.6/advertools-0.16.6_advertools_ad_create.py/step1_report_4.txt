  "purpose": "Generate advertisement strings by replacing placeholders in a template with given product names, with optional capitalization and fallback handling.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: template, replacements, fallback, max_len, capitalize.",
  "sinks": "Return statement producing a list of formatted ad strings; no external data sinks or network operations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed in a loop to generate formatted strings, applying length checks and fallback substitution before returning the list.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no external data leaks, and no obfuscated or malicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to create ads from a template with replacements, applying length constraints and optional capitalization. It performs length validation to prevent exceeding maximum length limits, substituting fallback text if needed. The function returns a list of formatted strings, either capitalized or not, based on the argument. The implementation is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or code injection. There are no external network calls, file operations, or hidden behaviors. The code is well-structured, with explicit comments and validation logic, indicating standard functionality rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for ad string generation with length constraints and optional formatting. It does not contain malicious or suspicious code. It is safe and does not pose security risks.",
