  "purpose": "Generate ad texts by inserting replacements into a template with length validation and optional capitalization.",
  "sources": "The 'template' string and 'replacements' list, used in string formatting.",
  "sinks": "Formatted strings inserted into the ad list; no external data sinks or leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Each replacement is formatted into the template; if too long, fallback is used; optional capitalization applied.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward string manipulation with length checks.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard string formatting with length validation, fallback substitution, and optional capitalization. No external calls, data leaks, or malicious code are present. The only minor concern is that 'template' is user-controlled, which could lead to unexpected formatting if maliciously crafted, but this is typical for such functions and not inherently malicious. All reviews correctly identify the code as benign, with malware score 0, obfuscation score 0, and low security risk (~0.1-0.2) due to input trust considerations. The logic is sound, and no vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, straightforward utility for ad text generation with proper validation. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent detected. The minimal security risk is primarily due to reliance on external 'template' input, which is standard in such scenarios. Scores of 0 for malware and obfuscation are appropriate; a risk score around 0.1-0.2 reflects minimal concern.",
