  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, straightforward utility for ad text generation with proper validation. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent detected. The minimal security risk is primarily due to reliance on external 'template' input, which is standard in such scenarios. Scores of 0 for malware and obfuscation are appropriate; a risk score around 0.1-0.2 reflects minimal concern."
