{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to generate advertising text by inserting product names or other replacements into a template, with safeguards for length and capitalization.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'template', 'replacements', 'fallback', 'max_len', 'capitalize'.",
  "sinks": "None evident; the code does not write to files, send data over the network, or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "The code formats each replacement into the template, applies length checks, substitutes fallback if necessary, and optionally capitalizes words.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. No obfuscated code or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The function performs straightforward string formatting, length validation, and optional capitalization. It raises an error if the template combined with fallback exceeds max length. The logic is standard for generating text ads and does not include any suspicious or malicious constructs. No external system calls, network activity, or data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility for generating ad text with length constraints and optional capitalization. It does not contain malware or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
