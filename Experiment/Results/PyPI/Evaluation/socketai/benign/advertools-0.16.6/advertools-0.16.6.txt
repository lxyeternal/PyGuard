      "obfuscated": 0,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is not inherently malicious but contains critical security vulnerabilities due to unsafe dynamic code execution practices. The use of eval() and runpy.run_path() on untrusted inputs, combined with unvalidated subprocess command construction, pose a high risk of arbitrary code execution and potential exploitation. The high malware score (around 0.8) and security risk (around 0.9) are justified. Obfuscation is not present. To mitigate these risks, input validation, sanitization, and avoiding eval() and unsafe external script execution are essential."

The overall security risk is minimal, primarily related to external API key management outside this code. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0, and the low risk score (~0.1) is justified."

The minimal security risk is primarily due to reliance on external 'template' input, which is standard in such scenarios. Scores of 0 for malware and obfuscation are appropriate; a risk score around 0.1-0.2 reflects minimal concern."
