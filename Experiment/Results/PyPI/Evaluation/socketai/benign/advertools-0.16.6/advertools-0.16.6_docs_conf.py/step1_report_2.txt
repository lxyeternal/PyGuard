  "purpose": "The code configures settings for generating documentation for the 'advertools' project using Sphinx, including paths, extensions, themes, and output options.",
  "sources": "Imports os, sys, and adv_version; reads project metadata; loads configuration for Sphinx extensions and paths; defines static paths and theme options.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or execute untrusted input or perform data transmission.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The static paths referencing sitemap and image files are part of configuration and do not exhibit malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx documentation configuration script. It sets paths, extensions, theme options, and output formats for generating project documentation. There are no indications of code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior. The script does not include network activity, file manipulation beyond static configuration, or runtime input handling. All code is static and for documentation setup purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration script for Sphinx documentation and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It simply sets up documentation parameters with no suspicious activity.",
