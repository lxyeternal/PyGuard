  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a static configuration script for Sphinx documentation.\n- The only external import is 'advertools' to fetch version info, which is benign.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is present.\n- Static paths, themes, and extensions are configured straightforwardly.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are detected.\n\n**Assessment of each report:**\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Correctly identifies the code as benign and static.  \n- Assigns malware and risk scores as 0, which is appropriate.  \n- Confidence is high (1).  \n- No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Also correctly states that the code is a standard configuration with no malicious activity.  \n- Malware and risk scores are 0.  \n- Confidence is high (1).  \n- No issues.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Same conclusion: benign, static configuration, no malicious behavior.  \n- Scores are 0 for malware and risk.  \n- Confidence is 1.0.  \n- No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Same analysis: standard setup, no suspicious activity.  \n- Scores are 0 for malware and risk.  \n- Confidence is 1.  \n- No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Consistent with others: benign static configuration.  \n- Scores are 0 for malware and risk.  \n- Confidence is 1.  \n- No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious or obfuscated code:** None.  \n- **Malware score:** Should be **0**, as there's no evidence of malicious behavior.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** Should be **0**, as the code is straightforward and readable.  \n- **Risk score:** Should be **0**, given the static, benign nature of the configuration.\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Recommendation |\n|----------------|----------------------|\n| Malware        | 0                    |\n| Obfuscated     | 0                    |\n| Risk           | 0                    |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign Sphinx configuration script with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The existing reports and scores are accurate and reasonable.",
