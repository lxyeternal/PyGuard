{
  "purpose": "This code is a static configuration script for setting up Sphinx documentation, specifying project info, extensions, paths, and output options.",
  "sources": "The code reads static configuration data, imports 'os', 'sys', and retrieves the version from 'advertools'.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or environment variable manipulations are present.",
  "flows": "The code flows from static import statements to configuration variable assignments; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and static, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Sphinx configuration file with static paths, extensions, and project info. The only dynamic element is importing 'advertools' to get its version, which is benign. No code injection, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is present. The code is well-structured, readable, and free of obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration script for documentation purposes. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and justified.",
