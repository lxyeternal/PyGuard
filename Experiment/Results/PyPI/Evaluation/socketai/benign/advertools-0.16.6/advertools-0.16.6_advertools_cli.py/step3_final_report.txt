  "purpose": "A CLI utility wrapping advertools for SEO, URL analysis, crawling, DNS lookups, and text/entity extraction, facilitating web analysis tasks.",
  "sources": "User inputs via command-line arguments, stdin, and files; network requests (DNS, crawling, sitemaps); external library functions.",
  "sinks": "Data outputs to CSV, JL, or stdout; network requests; file writes; print statements.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user inputs or files into advertools functions, with outputs directed to files or stdout; network requests are made based on user parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The default thread pool size (_max_workers=600) is unusually large, potentially resource-intensive but not malicious; no code obfuscation or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI orchestrator for advertools functions, performing URL parsing, crawling, DNS lookups, and data extraction. No dynamic code execution, code injection, or obfuscation is present. The large thread pool size is resource-heavy but not malicious. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1–0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, open-source CLI tool for SEO and web analysis, with no signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or supply chain compromise. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified; the slightly elevated risk score accounts for resource usage but not security threats.",
