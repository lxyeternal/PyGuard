  "purpose": "This script provides command-line tools for SEO, web crawling, URL analysis, entity extraction, and related digital marketing data processing using the advertools library.",
  "sources": "User inputs via command-line arguments and standard input streams; URLs, IP addresses, text files, and configuration options.",
  "sinks": "Outputs CSV or JSON data to files or stdout; performs network requests (DNS lookups, web crawling); reads files for keyword and text analysis.",
  "flows": "User inputs → command-line argument parsing → function calls → network requests (DNS, web crawling) or data processing → outputs (files or stdout).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; dynamic code execution occurs via user-provided files and arguments; no suspicious obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a command-line interface for various data analysis, URL, and web crawling tasks, relying heavily on user-provided inputs and external libraries. It performs network operations such as DNS lookups and web crawling, but these are typical features for a cybersecurity or SEO toolkit. There are no indications of malicious behaviors like unauthorized data exfiltration, system damage, or covert backdoors. The only potential concern is the reliance on user-supplied files and arguments, which could theoretically be exploited if malicious files are used, but this is typical for command-line tools. No hardcoded secrets, reverse shells, or suspicious network activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate tool for SEO and web analysis, with no evidence of malicious intent. It performs network and data processing functions typical for its domain. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or sabotage embedded in the code. Its functionality depends on external inputs, which should be validated by the user, but the code itself is not malicious.",
