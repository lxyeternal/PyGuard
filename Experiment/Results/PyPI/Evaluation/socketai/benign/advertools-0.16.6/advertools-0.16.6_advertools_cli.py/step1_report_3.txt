  "purpose": "This script provides command-line tools for SEO, SEM, and digital marketing analysis, including crawling, URL parsing, entity extraction, and data processing.",
  "sources": "Reads input from command-line arguments, standard input, files (via open()), and network (socket.gethostbyaddr).",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to CSV files, standard output, standard error, and possibly network via adv.crawl and adv.crawl_headers functions.",
  "flows": "User inputs (URLs, text, files) are processed and passed to functions like adv.crawl, adv.robotstxt_to_df, adv.sitemap_to_df, adv.url_to_df, adv.extract, adv.word_tokenize, adv.word_frequency, adv.emoji_search, adv.kw_generate, adv.logs_to_df, adv.crawl_headers, adv.reverse_dns_lookup, etc. Data flows from inputs to function calls, then to outputs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of sys.stdin.read() without strict validation; dynamic options parsing with _split_options; no obvious hardcoded secrets; no suspicious URL or network activity beyond expected function calls. No hidden code or obfuscated sections; use of standard libraries and adv. tools. No unusual dynamic execution or eval statements observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive CLI interface for various web and data analysis tasks. It reads inputs via command-line arguments and stdin, processes them, and calls corresponding adv. functions. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, system damage, reverse shells, or hidden backdoors. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URL connections, or malicious payloads are evident. The socket.gethostbyaddr is used solely for DNS lookup, not for malicious purposes. The adv library functions are assumed to be standard and trustworthy, as they are open-source and documented. The code employs standard practices, with no dynamic code evaluation, obfuscation, or code injection points. Overall, it appears to be legitimate utility code for SEO and web data analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured command-line interface for web crawling, URL analysis, and data processing. No malicious behavior or sabotage is detected. It mainly orchestrates data flow between user inputs and adv. library functions without any suspicious or malicious logic. The risk of malware or security threats is negligible, assuming adv. library functions are safe.",
