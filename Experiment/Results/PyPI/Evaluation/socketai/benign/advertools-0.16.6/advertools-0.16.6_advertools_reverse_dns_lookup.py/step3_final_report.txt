  "purpose": "Performs reverse DNS lookups for a list of IP addresses, retrieving hostnames, alias lists, and IP address lists, with statistical summaries.",
  "sources": "Input list of IP addresses; socket.gethostbyaddr for DNS resolution.",
  "sinks": "Internal data processing; no external data transmission or malicious sinks.",
  "flows": "Input IPs -> DNS resolution via socket.gethostbyaddr -> Data aggregation into pandas DataFrame.",
  "anomalies": "Standard exception handling; use of '@@' separator is benign; no suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes standard Python libraries for DNS resolution, employing parallel processing (threading or multiprocessing) based on OS for efficiency. It handles exceptions gracefully, returning error messages when resolution fails. No obfuscation, malicious code, or external network activity beyond DNS lookups is present. The processing logic is straightforward, with data summarized in pandas DataFrames for reporting. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign, utility nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe utility for reverse DNS lookups. No malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation signs are detected. The low security risk scores are appropriate given the functionality. The reports' assessments are accurate and should remain unchanged.",
