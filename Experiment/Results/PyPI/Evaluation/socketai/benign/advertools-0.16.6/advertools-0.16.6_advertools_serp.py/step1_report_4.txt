{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to query Google and YouTube APIs for search results and detailed information about videos and channels, with support for multiple query parameters and data normalization.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters for search queries, API keys, and IDs; it fetches data from Google's APIs via HTTP requests; it processes and normalizes JSON responses.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur if API keys or sensitive identifiers are exposed or logged; external requests are made to Google APIs, but no malicious data exfiltration or unauthorized system actions are evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (API keys, search terms, IDs) are used to generate request parameters, which are sent via requests.get() to Google APIs; responses are processed, normalized, and merged into dataframes; dataframes are returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data are present; logging is limited to informational messages; no code injection, system modification, or suspicious external connections are detected. Use of external APIs is standard and controlled.",
  "analysis": "The code includes functions to fetch detailed video and channel info from YouTube, as well as functions to perform Google searches and process JSON responses. Input validation ensures only valid parameters are used. External requests are to official Google APIs with standard HTTP requests. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are present. There is no evidence of backdoors, malicious data exfiltration, or harmful system modifications. The only potential concern is the exposure of API keys if logged or shared, but no such logging of secrets is observed. The code is designed for legitimate data retrieval and processing in a cybersecurity context, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code performs legitimate API querying and data processing for search and video/channel details. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code appears well-structured and safe, with no signs of obfuscation or sabotage.",
