{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to query Google Custom Search and YouTube APIs, retrieve detailed video and channel information, and normalize JSON responses into pandas DataFrames. It includes parameter validation against predefined allowed values and handles API interactions via requests.",
  "sources": "API request parameters, JSON responses from Google and YouTube APIs, input parameter lists for batch processing.",
  "sinks": "DataFrames containing search results, video details, and channel details; no data exfiltration or malicious data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> API request via requests.get() -> JSON response -> pandas normalization and DataFrame construction -> output DataFrame with combined data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious code injection, no malicious network activity, no backdoors or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard API requests to Google and YouTube, with parameter validation to prevent invalid requests. JSON responses are normalized into pandas DataFrames, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads. Logging is used for informational purposes, not malicious activity. API keys are passed as parameters, not hardcoded, reducing risk. No suspicious network activity or code injection is present. The functions are typical API wrappers with proper validation and response handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent API client for Google Search and YouTube Data APIs, with no signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation. The overall security risk is minimal, primarily related to external API key management outside this code. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0, and the low risk score (~0.1) is justified.",
