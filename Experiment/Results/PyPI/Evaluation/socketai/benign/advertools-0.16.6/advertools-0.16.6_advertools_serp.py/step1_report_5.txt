{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to query Google Custom Search, YouTube Search API, and retrieve details about videos and channels from YouTube, primarily for data collection and analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters from function arguments, including API keys, search queries, IDs, and various parameter options; makes HTTP requests to external APIs; and processes JSON responses from these requests.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs DataFrames containing search results, video and channel details, and metadata; it does not write to external or untrusted destinations directly. No data leaks or untrusted data effects are evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> API request parameters -> HTTP requests to Google and YouTube APIs -> JSON responses -> DataFrame construction and normalization -> Return of structured data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity; usage of standard API endpoints and request handling. No unusual code or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically handles input validation, parameter normalization, API requests, and JSON parsing. It includes proper error handling for API responses and normalizes nested JSON data into DataFrames. The functions focus on data retrieval without executing or executing code from untrusted sources. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious privacy violations are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate data collection utility for search and YouTube API data. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. It appears to be designed solely for structured API querying and data normalization, with no harmful or sabotage elements.",
