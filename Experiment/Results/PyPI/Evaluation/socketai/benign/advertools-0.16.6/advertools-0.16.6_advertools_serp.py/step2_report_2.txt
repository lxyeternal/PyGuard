  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing the described functionality, code logic, and potential security implications to our understanding of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Summary:** The code is a standard API wrapper for Google Search and YouTube, with parameter validation, response normalization, and no malicious behavior.  \n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code makes external API requests, processes JSON responses into pandas DataFrames, and validates parameters. It notes no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads.  \n- **Score Justification:** The malware score of 0 is appropriate. The security risk is low (~0.2), considering API key handling is external and no secrets are hardcoded.  \n- **Conclusion:** Accurate and consistent. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing legitimate API interactions, response parsing, and parameter validation. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected.  \n- **Assessment:** The analysis aligns well with the code's purpose. It correctly states that the code is a legitimate API client with no signs of malware or sabotage.  \n- **Score Justification:** Malware score 0 is justified. Security risk is low (~0.2).  \n- **Conclusion:** Consistent. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Summary:** The code performs API requests to Google and YouTube, normalizes JSON responses, and merges data into DataFrames. No signs of malicious activity or data exfiltration.  \n- **Assessment:** The report accurately describes the flow: parameter validation, API requests, JSON parsing, and data normalization. No malicious behavior, code injection, or backdoors are evident.  \n- **Score Justification:** Malware score of 0 is appropriate. Security risk (~0.2) is low, given API key handling is external.  \n- **Conclusion:** Correct. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Summary:** The code is a legitimate API client for search and video/channel details, with standard validation and data processing. No malicious behavior or obfuscation.  \n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly notes that the code makes external API calls, normalizes JSON, and validates parameters. No malicious intent or sabotage detected.  \n- **Score Justification:** Malware score 0 is justified. Security risk (~0.1 to 0.2) is minimal.  \n- **Conclusion:** Accurate. No modifications necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Summary:** The code is a data collection utility for Google and YouTube APIs, with proper input validation, response normalization, and no signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Assessment:** The description matches the code's behavior: external API requests, JSON normalization, and no malicious patterns.  \n- **Score Justification:** Malware score 0 is appropriate. Security risk is negligible.  \n- **Conclusion:** Consistent. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is justified given the code's nature as an API wrapper with no malicious payloads, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's transparency.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (~0.1-0.2), mainly due to external API key handling and data flow, but no significant security risks are identified.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware:** **0** — no signs of malicious code or payloads.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear, well-structured, and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — minimal, primarily related to external API key management and data exposure if keys are mishandled outside this code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, thorough, and consistent with the code's functionality. No indications of malware, sabotage, or obfuscation are present. The overall security posture of this code is very low risk, serving as a legitimate API wrapper for data retrieval.\n\n**Final Recommendation:** Keep the scores as they are, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a very low risk score (~0.1).",
