{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for querying Google Search and YouTube APIs to retrieve search results and media details, with parameters allowing multiple query configurations and responses structured into pandas DataFrames.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include API keys, user-supplied query parameters, and URL parameters within the functions. External inputs are primarily API responses from requests to Google's and YouTube's APIs.",
  "sinks": "The code processes and consolidates API response data into DataFrames; no direct data leaks or untrusted data flows are evident. No data is transmitted or stored outside the local context, nor are there indications of malicious data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Data flows from API requests (sources) to JSON responses, which are parsed into DataFrames (sinks). The functions normalize and merge these DataFrames without executing untrusted code or performing data leaks. Parameters are constructed and validated, but no untrusted code execution occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets are found. The code does include verbose logging but no evidence of backdoors, code injection, or obfuscated logic. No hidden or malicious behavior is apparent. The code is well-structured and primarily API interaction and data normalization.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple functions for making authorized API requests to Google Search and YouTube, handling pagination, normalization, and merging of JSON data into pandas DataFrames. Parameter validation uses predefined allowed values, preventing injection or malicious parameter manipulation. The requests are straightforward HTTP GETs with API keys, with no dynamic code execution, eval, or obfuscated logic. No hardcoded credentials or secret tokens are present. Logging is used for informational purposes only. Overall, the functions perform standard API data collection and normalization, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate API wrapper for Google and YouTube data retrieval. There are no indications of malware, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. The usage of API keys and parameter validation mitigates common security risks. The code is well-structured, and the logic is transparent. Overall, low risk of malicious behavior.",
