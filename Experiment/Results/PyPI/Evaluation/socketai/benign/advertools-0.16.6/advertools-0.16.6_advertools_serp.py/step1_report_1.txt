{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to query Google Custom Search and YouTube APIs for search results, videos, and channel details, returning results as pandas DataFrames.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as API keys, query strings, and IDs; data fetched via requests.get() calls to Google APIs.",
  "sinks": "Response data from API calls, which are parsed and converted into pandas DataFrames. No data is written to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "Parameters are processed and combined; requests are sent to Google APIs; responses are parsed into DataFrames; additional video/channel details are retrieved and merged; final DataFrame returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets beyond API keys; no suspicious code behavior, no backdoors, or hidden functionalities. Logging level settings are standard. The _split_by_comma function's behavior is straightforward; no obfuscation or misleading code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs legitimate API requests to Google Custom Search and YouTube Data APIs, processes JSON responses into pandas DataFrames, and includes functions for fetching video and channel details by IDs. It validates parameters against predefined sets to prevent invalid requests. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious network activity are present. Logging is for debugging and informational purposes only. No use of dynamic code execution or obfuscated code. Sensitive data such as API keys are expected to be supplied externally; no hardcoded credentials are present. The functions operate within standard API usage patterns, and there are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or unauthorized data access.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured utility module for accessing Google and YouTube APIs, with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. It functions as an API wrapper with parameter validation and response parsing. Overall security risks are minimal, and there are no signs of malware or supply chain sabotage.",
