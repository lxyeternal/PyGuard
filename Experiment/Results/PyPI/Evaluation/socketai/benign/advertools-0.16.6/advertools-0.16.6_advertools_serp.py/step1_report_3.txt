{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to perform search queries on Google and YouTube APIs, retrieve search results, and fetch detailed information about videos and channels, primarily for data analysis and research purposes.",
  "sources": "API requests to 'https://www.googleapis.com/...'; input parameters for search queries such as 'q', 'channelId', 'videoId', etc.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external APIs ('requests.get'); JSON responses parsed into pandas DataFrames; potential data exfiltration if API keys are mishandled or misused.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> Validation -> API request construction -> External API calls -> JSON response parsing -> DataFrame creation and merging -> Return of search results or details.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; API keys are passed as parameters, which is standard. No obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic execution, backdoors, or hidden code. Logging occurs but no malicious data is sent elsewhere.",
  "analysis": "The code performs API requests to Google's Custom Search and YouTube Data API. It normalizes and merges the returned JSON data into pandas DataFrames for further analysis. All data flows involve external API calls with provided API keys, which is typical for such applications. No signs of malware, backdoors, data theft, or hidden malicious behavior are detected. The code handles multiple parameters, constructs query combinations, and processes responses securely. There are no indications of malicious intent, such as covert data exfiltration, malicious code injection, or remote command execution. The presence of extensive valid parameter validation and standard API interaction patterns suggests a legitimate purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate API client for search and video data retrieval from Google and YouTube. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors detected. Its design aligns with common data collection tools, with no indicators of supply chain attacks or sabotage.",
