  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the logical consistency, the presence of malicious indicators, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides functions to query Google Custom Search and YouTube APIs, processes JSON responses into pandas DataFrames, validates parameters, and performs no obfuscated or malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code, no backdoors, no obfuscation. The functions are standard API wrappers with parameter validation and response normalization.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is sound. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent. The low security risk score (0.2) is reasonable, considering potential external misuse (e.g., API key exposure if mishandled). The malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, the code performs API requests, normalizes JSON data, and includes parameter validation. No malicious behaviors or obfuscation are detected.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, no backdoors, no suspicious activity. The code is well-structured and typical for API clients.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis aligns with the code's nature. The low risk score and zero malware/obfuscation scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Functions for search and media details retrieval, with standard API calls and JSON parsing. No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** API keys are passed as parameters, which is normal. No code injection, backdoors, or obfuscation. The data flows are typical.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is consistent. The low risk score is appropriate given the absence of malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Functions for querying APIs, normalizing JSON, and merging data into DataFrames. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, no malicious code, no suspicious external activity. The code is for legitimate data collection.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe very low risk score (0.1) is justified, considering the code's benign nature and standard API interactions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, functions for querying Google and YouTube APIs, with proper validation and normalization. No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, no backdoors, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe zero risk and malware scores are appropriate, given the benign purpose and implementation.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior, with scores at 0.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no obfuscation or hidden logic is present.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2) reflects minimal security risk, mainly due to external API key handling, which is standard and expected.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a legitimate API wrapper for Google and YouTube, with parameter validation, JSON normalization, and no suspicious or malicious features.\n- No signs of supply chain sabotage, malware, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the detailed reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior detected)  \n**Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation or hidden logic)  \n**Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, mostly due to external API key management, which is standard practice)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and well-justified. The code is safe, legitimate, and aligned with its described purpose.",
