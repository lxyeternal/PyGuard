  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent API client for Google Search and YouTube Data APIs, with no signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation. The overall security risk is minimal, primarily related to external API key management outside this code. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0, and the low risk score (~0.1) is justified."
