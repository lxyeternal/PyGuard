  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for packaging a Python project named 'advertools'.",
  "sources": "Reading files 'README.rst' and 'HISTORY.rst'; importing modules; defining dependencies and setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no untrusted data output or network activity; setup configuration files are standard.",
  "flows": "Input from files -> variables -> setup() configuration; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution; straightforward setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup procedures for a Python package, importing modules, reading documentation files, defining dependencies, and invoking setup() with package metadata. No dynamic code execution, network connections, or suspicious behaviors detected. No obfuscated code or hidden logic present. All dependencies are declared explicitly, and no untrusted input is processed or output.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a conventional setup configuration for packaging a Python project. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on the provided code. It is safe to use.",
