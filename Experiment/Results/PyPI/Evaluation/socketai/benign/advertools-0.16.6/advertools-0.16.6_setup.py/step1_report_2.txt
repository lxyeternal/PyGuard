  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for packaging and distributing a Python project named 'advertools'.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' and 'HISTORY.rst' files; importing modules; reading package metadata.",
  "sinks": "None of the code appears to send data externally, execute untrusted input, or write to sensitive locations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the script only reads local files and sets up package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or unusual code behaviors. The script appears standard for Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, reads local documentation files, defines dependencies, and configures setup parameters. All operations are typical for a setup.py file. No malicious code, network activity, or data leaks are present. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are evident. The code strictly manages package configuration without any runtime data processing or external communication.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup script is benign and typical for Python package distribution. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or malware. The code follows standard practices with no anomalies or suspicious features.",
