  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Overview:**\n- The script is a standard `setup.py` for packaging a Python project.\n- It reads local documentation files (`README.rst`, `HISTORY.rst`) for long description.\n- It specifies dependencies, package metadata, entry points, and configuration options.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is present.\n- The code is straightforward, using common setup practices.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** None. All reports agree that the code is standard, benign, and follows typical setup practices.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risks:** None detected.\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes:\n- No logical flaws, code errors, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The reports correctly identify that the code does not perform any malicious or risky operations.\n\n### Score Justification:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — No malicious activity, code, or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — Code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — No security risks identified.\n\n### Additional Observations:\n- All reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is a typical setup script with no anomalies.\n- The confidence in these assessments is high (1), given the thorough analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\nBased on the code and the reports, I agree with the provided evaluations. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe setup script for `advertools` is entirely benign and standard. No further security concerns are warranted.\n\n---\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a detailed breakdown or further analysis.",
