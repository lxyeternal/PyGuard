{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging a Python project named 'advertools'. It defines package metadata, dependencies, entry points, and other configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads README.rst and HISTORY.rst files for long description; imports modules; specifies dependencies; defines setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted input sinks are present; no data flows from external sources into sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No malicious source-to-sink data flow identified; the code primarily configures package metadata and dependencies without executing untrusted code or data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The script follows standard setup conventions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'os' and 'setuptools', reads static files for long description, and sets up package information and dependencies. All data appears static and derived from local files. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity is observed.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears legitimate and standard for Python package distribution. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in the provided code.",
