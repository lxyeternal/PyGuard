{
  "purpose": "The code appears to generate Python interface stubs (.pyi files) for a Browser automation library, including dynamically creating method signatures based on runtime keyword data.",
  "sources": "Reads data from 'br.get_keyword_names()', 'br.attributes', 'br.get_keyword_arguments()', and 'br.get_keyword_types()'. Uses the 'sys' module for Python version info and 'Path' for file operations.",
  "sinks": "Writes to 'Browser/browser.pyi' file; does not handle untrusted data directly in a way that affects runtime behavior or system security.",
  "flows": "Retrieves keyword names and attributes, processes method signatures, writes static stub file. No data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks beyond file writing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no network activity or reverse shell indications. The code relies on external data (browser keywords) but processes it safely for stub generation.",
  "analysis": "The script dynamically generates Python type hint stubs (.pyi) for a browser automation library based on runtime keyword data. It uses standard modules and safe string operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The file operations are for writing static interface definitions, not executing untrusted code. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns are present. The code's purpose is to create type hints, which is benign. No obfuscation or malware indicators are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign stub generator for a Python library. It uses runtime data to produce static type hints and writes them to a file. There are no signs of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks.",
