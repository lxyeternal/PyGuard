{
  "purpose": "The code generates Python stub (.pyi) files for the Browser class by introspecting runtime keyword data, extracting method signatures and types for static type hinting and documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads keyword names, arguments, and types from the 'br' object via methods like get_keyword_names(), get_keyword_arguments(), and get_keyword_types().",
  "sinks": "Writes the generated stub content to 'Browser/browser.pyi' file.",
  "flows": "Retrieves keyword metadata from 'br', formats method signatures and argument types, then writes the formatted stub to a file.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, no obfuscated code, no external network activity, no hardcoded secrets, and no dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs static introspection of the 'br' object to extract method signatures and types, then formats and writes this data into a stub file. It uses standard library modules and straightforward string operations. No untrusted data is executed or transmitted. The purpose aligns with documentation or IDE support, not malicious activity. The code is clear, well-structured, and relies on safe practices. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for generating type stub files for the Browser class, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. It operates solely through static data collection and file writing, which are standard and safe operations in this context.",
