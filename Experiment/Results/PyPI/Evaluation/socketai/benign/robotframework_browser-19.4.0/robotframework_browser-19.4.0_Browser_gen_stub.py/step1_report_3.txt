  "purpose": "This code appears to generate type stub files (.pyi) for a Python package related to browser automation, specifically the Browser class and its methods, using runtime introspection and keyword data from the 'Browser' module.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from 'br' (an instance of Browser.Browser), including keyword names, attributes, argument specifications, and types via methods like get_keyword_names, get_keyword_arguments, get_keyword_types. It also reads system information from sys.version_info and imports from standard libraries and third-party modules.",
  "sinks": "The code writes to files ('Browser/browser.pyi') using file I/O operations. No untrusted data is fed into critical sinks that could cause security issues; the main concern is the static file generation process.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'br' methods (get_keyword_names, get_keyword_arguments, get_keyword_types) to generate method signatures and type annotations, then these are written into a stub file. No external untrusted data influences this flow; the process is static and introspective.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code patterns such as obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hidden behaviors. All code is straightforward: data extraction via class methods and file writing. No hardcoded secrets, network operations, or backdoors are evident. The code comments and license headers are standard.",
  "analysis": "The script performs static code analysis to generate stub files for a Python library, extracting method signatures and types at runtime from the 'Browser' object. It uses introspection and type annotations to create interface definitions. No external inputs or untrusted data influence the process. The code is well-structured, with no signs of malicious or suspicious behaviors. It primarily automates documentation or type stub generation, a common practice in Python projects. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malware signals are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for generating type stubs for a browser automation library. It relies on introspection and static file writing without any malicious or suspicious behaviors. The overall security risk is negligible.",
