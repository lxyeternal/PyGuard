{
  "purpose": "A wrapper for managing a Node.js Playwright process, including startup, health checks, and cleanup, using environment variables and grpc communication.",
  "sources": "Filesystem checks for dependencies, environment variables for configuration, subprocess for process control, grpc for health checks and cleanup.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks; process control and grpc communication are standard and do not involve untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence process startup; grpc calls check process health; cleanup involves grpc commands and process termination.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns detected; code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code performs dependency verification, process startup with subprocess, grpc health checks, and cleanup. It uses environment variables for configuration, which is standard. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The process management and grpc communication follow typical patterns for such wrappers. No signs of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are evident. The malware score is correctly 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risk in process control code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured process management wrapper for a Playwright server, with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
