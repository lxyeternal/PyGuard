  "purpose": "A wrapper class for managing and communicating with a Node.js Playwright process for browser automation, including starting/stopping processes and establishing gRPC channels.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., ROBOT_FRAMEWORK_BROWSER_NODE_PORT, ROBOT_FRAMEWORK_BROWSER_NODE_DEBUG_OPTIONS, PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH), user environment, file system for logs, subprocess calls to start Node.js, gRPC communication channels.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess invocation to start Node.js process, environment variables used for debugging and paths, gRPC stub calls for health checks and closing processes, process termination via .kill() method.",
  "flows": "Initialization checks for Node.js path -> starting Node.js process with scripts and ports -> gRPC health check -> communication with Playwright process -> process termination and cleanup.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables to control debug options and ports, no explicit hardcoded secrets or credentials, subprocess and process management appear standard, no obfuscated or suspicious code structures, logs to files or null device.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages a Playwright server process, starting it via subprocess with configurable options, and communicates via gRPC. It checks for Node.js installation, verifies dependencies, and manages environment variables for debugging and paths. All subprocess commands and environment variable usages appear legitimate and related to process management. The use of environment variables and subprocess is standard for such wrappers. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. The code handles process cleanup and server health checks with standard methods. No suspicious network activity or data leaks are evident. Overall, the code appears to be a typical process management wrapper for browser automation with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard wrapper for managing a Node.js-based Playwright server, with process handling, environment configuration, and gRPC communication. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code injections. The environment variable usage and subprocess calls are consistent with intended functionality and pose no security risks.",
