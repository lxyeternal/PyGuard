  "purpose": "Utility script to retrieve and log version information for Robot Framework, Playwright, and local version data.",
  "sources": "Subprocess calls to system commands ('robot --version', 'npm list playwright'), reading local JSON file (package.json), reading version.py file.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or external communications; only local reads and logs.",
  "flows": "Subprocess outputs and file contents are parsed and logged; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard practices. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs version retrieval via subprocess and file reads, then logs the results. It uses regex to extract version numbers. No suspicious behaviors, malicious actions, or obfuscation are present. The subprocess commands are static and safe, and the code does not process untrusted input or perform network activity. The regex patterns are simple and appropriate. Overall, the code is a benign utility with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version reporting utility with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
