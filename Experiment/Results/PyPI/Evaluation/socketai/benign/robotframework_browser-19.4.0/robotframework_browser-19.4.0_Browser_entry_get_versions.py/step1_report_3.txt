  "purpose": "Provides utility functions to retrieve version information for Robot Framework, Playwright, and local project files, primarily for display or logging purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads process output from subprocess commands, reads text from local JSON and version files, and accesses the filesystem to locate package.json and version.py.",
  "sinks": "Decodes subprocess stdout, reads local files such as version.py and package.json, and logs information.",
  "flows": "Subprocess commands retrieve external version data; file reads extract version info; regex matches parse version numbers; logs output for display.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious network connections, and no suspicious code execution. Use of subprocess is standard for version retrieval. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard operations for retrieving software version information through subprocess calls and file reads. It includes error handling for missing or malformed files but no suspicious behaviors. It reads external process output and local files safely without executing untrusted code or external data manipulation. No malware or malicious behavior is detected. The code appears to be straightforward version utility functions with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for version retrieval with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attack vectors, or security risks. It does not contain hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity. Overall, it appears safe.",
