{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python library or module for browser automation and testing, providing imports and metadata.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'assertionengine', local modules '.browser', '.utils.data_types', and '.version'. No user input or external data sources are directly read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data, execute code, or perform network operations are present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code primarily imports modules and defines metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. The license comments are standard. No hardcoded secrets or malicious constructs are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing specific modules and attributes, defining the package version, and exporting a list of public symbols. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling is present. The license comments are standard for open-source projects. All imports seem to be from local or well-known libraries. No anomalies or malicious code are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package module setup with imports and metadata. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this code segment.",
