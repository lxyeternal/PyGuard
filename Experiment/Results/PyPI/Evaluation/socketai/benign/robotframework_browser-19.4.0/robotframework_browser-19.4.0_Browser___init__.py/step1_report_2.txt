{
  "purpose": "This code appears to set up module exports and import dependencies for a Python package related to browser automation or testing, specifically part of the Robot Framework ecosystem.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'assertionengine', local modules '.browser', and '.utils.data_types', as well as the version information from '.version'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leakage or external effects are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from imported modules and version info into the module's namespace; no external or untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and primarily consists of imports and module exports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various classes and constants from internal modules, sets the module version, and defines the __all__ list for public API exposure. It contains no dynamic execution, input processing, or suspicious behavior. The license header and code structure are typical for open-source Python packages. No security risks, malware indicators, or obfuscation patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup for an open-source Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It functions as a public interface for other parts of the package.",
