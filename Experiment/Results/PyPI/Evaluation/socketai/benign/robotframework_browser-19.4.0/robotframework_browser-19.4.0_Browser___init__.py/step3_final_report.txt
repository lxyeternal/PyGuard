  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initialization module, importing various components and defining metadata for the package.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from internal modules and the version module; no external or untrusted data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or external data flows; the code only imports and exports symbols.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to internal imports and the assignment of version and __all__, with no external or untrusted data passing through.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python package initializer, importing modules and defining __all__ and version. It contains no dynamic execution, external data handling, or malicious code. All signals point to benign, standard setup code with no security risks or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initialization script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
