  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package related to browser automation or testing, providing imports and version information.",
  "sources": "Imports from assertionengine, .browser, and .utils.data_types modules; no external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points; no untrusted data handling or output functions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code mainly sets up module exports and versioning.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules and defines __version__ and __all__ for exports. It only involves module setup and version assignment. No external data handling, user input, or system commands are present. The structure and content follow standard package conventions, with no signs of malicious activity or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module setup with imports and versioning, containing no malicious or suspicious elements. It appears to be a benign part of a larger testing or automation framework.",
