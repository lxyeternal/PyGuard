{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an initial setup or module export file for a Python package related to web automation or testing, defining imports and versioning.",
  "sources": "Import statements for external modules (assertionengine, browser, data_types, version) and version assignment.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code primarily imports modules and defines exports.",
  "flows": "Imports are straightforward; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are observed. The version is imported from a local module.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports specific modules and defines an __all__ list for exports. It assigns a version from an imported module. There are no functions, no input handling, no network communication, or dynamic code execution. It appears to be a standard, benign module definition file with no malicious intent or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module setup for a Python package, primarily consisting of imports and metadata. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
