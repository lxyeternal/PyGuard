  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'robotframework-browser' Python library, defining metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading 'requirements.txt' for dependencies, reading 'README.md' for long description, appending 'Browser' directory to sys.path.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or environment variable leaks or code execution.",
  "flows": "Dependency file read -> dependencies assigned; sys.path.append -> module import resolution; setup() call with metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Use of sys.path.append('Browser') and reading dependencies directly from a file without validation; standard in setup scripts but potential vectors if files are malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It reads dependencies from a local file, modifies sys.path to include a directory, and calls setup() with project metadata. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious network activity is present. The minor concerns about dependency file handling and sys.path modification are typical in such scripts and do not indicate malicious intent. The code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation. The risk score is minimal, reflecting standard practices with slight caution due to external file reading and path modification.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, standard setup configuration for a Python package. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The minor procedural risks are typical and do not compromise security.",
