{
  "purpose": "The code is setting up a Python package for distribution, specifically for the 'robotframework-browser' library, including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading 'requirements.txt' file, reading 'README.md', and reading package data files.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data is being sent over the network, executed dynamically, or written to system in an unsafe manner.",
  "flows": "Read from 'requirements.txt' and 'README.md' files into variables used for setup; no untrusted data flow to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected. Usage of 'sys.path.append' could be benign or potentially problematic if malicious modules are placed in 'Browser' directory, but this is standard in package setups.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup operations for a Python package using setuptools. It reads dependency requirements and description files, defines package data, and sets installation parameters. No code execution, network activity, or secret handling is present. The use of 'sys.path.append' could potentially alter module loading paths but is typical in local setup scripts. No signs of malicious or suspicious behavior are found.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It mainly reads configuration and dependency files to prepare the package for distribution.",
