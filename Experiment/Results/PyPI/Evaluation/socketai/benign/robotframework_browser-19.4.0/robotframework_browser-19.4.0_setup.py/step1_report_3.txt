  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'robotframework-browser', including package data, dependencies, and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'requirements.txt', reading 'README.md', appending to sys.path, and defining package and setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "Installation requirements from 'requirements.txt' and execution of 'setup()' with the provided parameters.",
  "flows": "Reading dependencies from 'requirements.txt' and passing them to 'install_requires' for package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behavior detected. The code uses standard setup tools without dynamic execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and reads a requirements file directly without executing code from it. It defines package data and setup parameters for publishing a Python package, with no suspicious logic, data exfiltration, or malicious activity. All operations are standard for Python package setup scripts. No anomalies or malicious indicators found.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate, performing standard package configuration tasks.",
