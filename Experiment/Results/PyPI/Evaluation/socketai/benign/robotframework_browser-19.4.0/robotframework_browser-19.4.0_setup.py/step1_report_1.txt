  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for packaging a Python project, specifically for the 'robotframework-browser' library.",
  "sources": "Reading 'requirements.txt' in the 'Browser' directory, importing modules, and reading the 'README.md' file.",
  "sinks": "The 'install_requires' list, which is used during package installation, and the execution of 'setup()' with specified parameters.",
  "flows": "File reading operations feed data into variables; these variables are then passed into 'setup()' to define package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior are observed. The code uses standard setup.py procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to package a Python library. It reads a README for the long description, reads dependencies from a requirements.txt file, and configures package metadata. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, or suspicious imports are present. All data read operations involve static files and standard package setup procedures. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware signatures are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate, standard setup configuration for a Python package. No signs of malicious activity or security risks are identified.",
