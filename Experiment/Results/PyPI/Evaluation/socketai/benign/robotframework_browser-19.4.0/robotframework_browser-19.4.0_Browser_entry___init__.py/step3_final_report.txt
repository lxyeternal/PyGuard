  "purpose": "The code contains only license comments and legal notices with no executable logic or data handling.",
  "sources": "The comments themselves; no data input or external sources are read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output data, especially untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows exist as there is no executable code or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is purely comments with standard license headers.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of license comments and legal notices, with no executable statements, data handling, or embedded logic. No sources, sinks, or data flows are present. The code does not contain obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the content. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only license comments, and poses no security threat. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
