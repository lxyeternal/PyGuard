  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to the __version__ variable, which is standard in Python packages for versioning purposes. There are no input or output operations, no data processing, and no suspicious code structures. This is typical boilerplate code used for package versioning.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains only a straightforward version assignment with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
