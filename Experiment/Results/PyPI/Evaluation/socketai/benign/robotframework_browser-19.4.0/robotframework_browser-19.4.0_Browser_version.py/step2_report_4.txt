  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code only assigns a static version string to the `__version__` variable.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - The code is minimal and standard for Python package versioning.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - No reports identify any obfuscation, suspicious code, or malicious intent.\n   - The code does not perform any data processing, network activity, or external data reading.\n   - The absence of sinks, sources, or flows further supports benignity.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; no logical errors are present.\n   - The code is straightforward and aligns with common practices.\n\n4. **Score Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The confidence scores are high (1.0), reflecting certainty about benignity.\n   - The reasoning in each report is sound and consistent.\n\n5. **Potential for False Positives or Assumptions:**\n   - No claims are made about vulnerabilities based on assumptions; all analyses correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - Given the simplicity, there is no basis for suspicion.\n\n6. **Overall Consistency and Reasonableness:**\n   - The scores and conclusions are consistent with the code content.\n   - No modifications are necessary.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- The code is a standard version declaration with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- The malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.\n- The security risk score should also be 0.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is benign, and no security concerns are present. All scores and conclusions are appropriate and should remain as-is.",
