  "anomalies": "None observed; simple version string assignment without dynamic or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to a variable named __version__. There are no inputs, no untrusted data sources, and no complex logic. The code appears to serve as a package metadata indicator, a common practice in Python modules. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a version identifier for a package or module. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
