  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to the `__version__` variable.\n   - There are no external inputs, data processing, or output functions.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, dynamic code, or malicious behavior are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign boilerplate.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - The assessments appropriately assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk of 0, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign a confidence of 1 (or 1.0), which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - Malware scores are 0, correctly indicating no malicious activity.\n   - Security risk scores are 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions**:\n   - The reports correctly dismiss any assumptions of malicious intent based solely on this snippet.\n   - No claims are made about hidden behaviors or malicious payloads, which is appropriate.\n\n5. **Overall Consistency and Reasonableness**:\n   - The scoring aligns well with the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments needed; the assessments are accurate and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score**: **0** — No security risks identified.\n\n**Additional Notes**:\n- Given the simplicity of the code, the scores should remain at zero.\n- The confidence levels are appropriate and should stay at 1.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code snippet is a standard, benign version declaration. All reports correctly identify this, and the scoring reflects the absence of security concerns. No further action or adjustment is necessary.",
