  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to the __version__ variable, serving as package metadata.",
  "sources": "Static assignment in the code (__version__ = \"19.4.0\")",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or untrusted data handling occurs",
  "flows": "None; the code is a simple static assignment with no data flow",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward and standard, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static assignment of a version string to __version__, common in Python packages. No inputs, outputs, data flows, or dynamic behaviors are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is appropriately 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk score 0. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious or security concerns. All reports accurately reflect this, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
