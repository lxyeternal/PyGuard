  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** Correctly identifies the code as a polling assertion utility with no malicious intent.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behaviors, no obfuscation, no external data leaks. The logic is straightforward, focusing on retries, timing, and logging.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 (low, justified by the utility nature). Confidence is high (0.9).\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code; no issues detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the benign nature, with potential logging data leakage if misused but no malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code, standard polling pattern.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 (still low, justified). Confidence 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code; no malicious indicators.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Same as above—standard assertion polling with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No external network, no data exfiltration, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2. Confidence: 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis matches the code's functionality.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Reinforces that the code is a benign assertion retry utility.\n- **Findings:** Uses logging for debugging, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1. Confidence: 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Valid and consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Confirms that the code is a standard assertion polling utility, safe, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No network, data leaks, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.0. Confidence: 0.95.\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Content:** The code is a straightforward implementation of assertion polling with retries, timing, and logging. It does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications. The use of `wrapt`, `logger`, and standard Python modules suggests a testing utility rather than malicious code.\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports and the code itself indicate no malicious activity. I agree with the malware score of **0**.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs. I agree with **0**.\n\n- **Risk Score:** The provided scores are very low (0.1-0.2). Given the code's purpose and absence of malicious behavior, I concur. However, the only minor concern could be if the `logger` is misused to leak sensitive data, but as per the analysis, it's intended for debugging.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (consistent with the reports and code purpose)\n\nThis code appears to be a legitimate, safe utility for assertion polling within testing frameworks, with no signs of malicious or supply chain security issues.\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, well-understood, and free of malicious intent. The provided scores are reasonable and should be maintained.",
