  "purpose": "Utility functions and decorator for assertion polling with retries, timing, and logging within testing frameworks.",
  "sources": "Configuration attributes (timeout, retry_assertions_for), function annotations, arguments passed to wrapped functions.",
  "sinks": "Logging outputs, exception handling pathways, timing calculations, and assertion operations.",
  "flows": "Input data (assertion operators, timing parameters) are processed through annotations and arguments, leading to retries and logging, with no external network or system modifications.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; minor unused variable 'assertion_op_name' but does not impact functionality or security.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of assertion polling with retries, timing, and logging. It reads configuration from class attributes and annotations, performs retries with sleep intervals, and logs metrics. No network activity, data exfiltration, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present. The logic is standard for testing utilities, and the code is clear and well-structured. The logging could potentially leak sensitive info if misused, but as implemented, it appears intended for debugging. Overall, the code poses no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard assertion polling utility used in testing frameworks. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
