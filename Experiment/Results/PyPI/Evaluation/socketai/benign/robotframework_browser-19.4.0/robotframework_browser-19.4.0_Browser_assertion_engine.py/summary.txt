  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard assertion polling utility used in testing frameworks. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content."
