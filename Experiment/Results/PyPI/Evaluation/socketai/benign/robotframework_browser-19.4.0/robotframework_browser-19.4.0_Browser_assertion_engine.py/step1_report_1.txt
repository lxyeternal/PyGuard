{
  "purpose": "This code provides a decorator for polling assertions with timeout and retry logic, and utility functions for assertion operators, primarily used for testing or validation purposes within the Robot Framework environment.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration and class attributes (wrapped.__annotations__), calls wrapped functions with provided arguments, and accesses class instance variables (instance.timeout, instance.retry_assertions_for).",
  "sinks": "Executes the wrapped function, potentially handling assertion errors, and performs logging via the logger module. No direct data leaks or external data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from function arguments to the wrapped function; assertion operators are extracted from annotations and arguments; logging occurs after assertion retries based on timing; no external network or system commands are invoked.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. The code appears straightforward, focused on assertion retries and logging. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for assertion handling and a decorator that implements polling logic for assertions with retries. It reads configuration values from object attributes, handles exceptions, and performs logging. All operations are contained within standard Python function calls, with no external system calls, network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The logic is typical for test assertion frameworks, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate testing utility designed for assertion polling with no malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily handles assertion retries, timing, and logging, with no indication of sabotage, malware, or privacy violations.",
