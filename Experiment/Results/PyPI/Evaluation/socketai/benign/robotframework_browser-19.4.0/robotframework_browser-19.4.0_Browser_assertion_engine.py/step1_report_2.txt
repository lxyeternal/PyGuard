{
  "purpose": "The code provides a decorator for polling assertions with retry logic and assertion handling utilities, likely used in testing frameworks.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function arguments, instance attributes (`timeout`, `retry_assertions_for`), and global variables like `logger`.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leakage if `logger` writes sensitive information; no other direct sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Inputs (args, kwargs, instance attributes) flow into the assertion handling and polling logic, with logs being generated. No external network or file operations are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no suspicious code constructs. The code uses sleep delays and logging but does not perform any malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of an assertion polling mechanism with retries, logging, and assertion operator checks. It leverages decorators and utility functions. No obfuscated or suspicious code structures are present. It does not interact with network resources, files, or environment variables. The logger usage could potentially expose sensitive data if misused, but as written, it appears intended for debugging/testing purposes. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system modification, or backdoors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility for assertion polling in testing frameworks. There are no malicious behaviors or security risks identified. It primarily handles retry logic and logging for assertions, with no indicators of supply chain sabotage or malware.",
