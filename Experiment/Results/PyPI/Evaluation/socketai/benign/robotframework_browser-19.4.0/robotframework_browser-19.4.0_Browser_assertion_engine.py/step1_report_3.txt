{
  "purpose": "This code provides decorators and utility functions for assertion polling and handling within a testing framework, primarily to retry assertions with timeout handling.",
  "sources": "Code reads class instance attributes (timeout, retry_assertions_for), function annotations, and arguments passed to the decorated functions.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or outputs untrusted data; it only manages control flow and logging.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., timeout values, assertion operators, function arguments) flow into assertion handling logic, which controls retries and logging but does not process untrusted data for dangerous operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. Usage of sleep and time functions is standard for polling mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for assertion management, including detecting assertion operators in annotations, retrying assertions with timeout controls, and logging assertion attempts. The functions utilize standard libraries, third-party wrapt for decorators, and a logger utility. The control flow revolves around retrying assertion failures with a timeout, and logging metrics about these retries. No external data is processed or transmitted, and no insecure operations are evident. The code appears legitimate for its purpose and does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of assertion polling with logging, without malicious intent or security risks. It is unlikely to be malicious or maliciously sabotaged based on the provided content.",
