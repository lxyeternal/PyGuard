{
  "purpose": "The code provides decorators and utility functions for handling assertion polling and assertion operator checking within a testing framework, specifically related to the Robot Framework foundation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function arguments, annotations, and instance attributes such as 'timeout' and 'retry_assertions_for'. It also reads from the imported modules 'logger' and 'wrapt'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not perform any data writes, network communication, or sensitive data handling. It mainly manages control flow, logging, and assertion logic within the test framework.",
  "flows": "Input data from function arguments and class instance attributes flow through the assertion_operator_is_set and with_assertion_polling functions, primarily affecting the flow control and logging. There are no external data flows or network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code uses standard library functions and common third-party modules with no signs of malicious obfuscation or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines decorators and utility functions for managing assertion retries and operator checks within a testing framework. It uses time-based control to implement polling, with logging to track statistics. No data leaks, network operations, or malicious behavior are evident. The code appears standard and safe, primarily focused on assertion handling.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of assertion polling and operator detection within a test automation framework. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or system manipulation.",
