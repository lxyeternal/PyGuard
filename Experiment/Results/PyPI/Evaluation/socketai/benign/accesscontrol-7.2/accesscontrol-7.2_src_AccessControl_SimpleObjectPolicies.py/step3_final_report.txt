{
  "purpose": "Defines access control rules for object attributes and container types, allowing configuration and temporary overrides to enforce security policies.",
  "sources": "Internal configuration functions, type checks, and context managers; no external untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or data leaks; configuration modifies internal assertion mappings.",
  "flows": "Configuration functions set assertions and override assertions temporarily via context managers.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code manages security assertions for various data types and container types, providing mechanisms to allow types and override assertions temporarily. It uses standard patterns for security configuration, with no external data flow or malicious behavior. The code is well-structured, with clear comments and functions that serve as a security utility within a framework like Zope. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate security utility module for managing object attribute access control. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk score (around 0.1) is appropriate given its purpose and implementation.",
