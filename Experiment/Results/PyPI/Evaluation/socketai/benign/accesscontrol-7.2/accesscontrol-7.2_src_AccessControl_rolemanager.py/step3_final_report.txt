{
  "purpose": "The code implements an access control system managing roles, permissions, and local roles within a framework, primarily for permission and role management, including debug info.",
  "sources": "Methods accessing user data, request attributes, class and instance attributes, and internal permission structures.",
  "sinks": "Functions modifying permissions, roles, local roles, and internal data structures; debug info exposing internal state.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user input, method parameters, and internal attributes into permission and role management functions; no external network activity or data exfiltration detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns. Use of base64 encoding in `_string_hash` is benign and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, well-structured role and permission management module with proper security decorators. It handles permissions, roles, local roles, and debug info without suspicious patterns. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external communication. The use of standard libraries and straightforward logic supports its benign nature. The low security risk score (0.2) reflects potential misconfiguration risks but not inherent vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard access control implementation with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate. It is safe and trustworthy, requiring no adjustments.",
