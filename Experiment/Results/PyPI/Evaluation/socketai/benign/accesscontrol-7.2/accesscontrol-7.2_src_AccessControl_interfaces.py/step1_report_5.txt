  "purpose": "Define interfaces for access control, ownership, permissions, roles, and security policies in a Zope-based system.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources; mainly defines interface method signatures.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or actions; code only declares interfaces without implementation.",
  "flows": "No data flows; purely interface declarations without executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of interface definitions for access control and security management. It lacks executable code or data processing logic that could be exploited. There are no input sources, sinks, or flows that handle untrusted data. The code appears to be a standard interface declaration for a Zope security framework. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, non-malicious interface declaration module for security policies and access control in a Zope-based system. No evidence of malicious intent or security risks found.",
