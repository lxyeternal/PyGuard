  "purpose": "Define constant permission strings for Zope built-in permissions",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources; constants are hardcoded strings",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling that could lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted code",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only assigns string constants",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic present; the code is straightforward constant definitions",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of string variable assignments defining permission labels for Zope permissions. There are no input sources, no untrusted data processing, no code execution, network calls, or data leaks. It appears to be a static configuration module with no hidden or malicious behavior. The structure and content are consistent with standard permission definitions. No indicators of malware, backdoors, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard permissions definition module for Zope. It contains no malicious behavior, no external data handling, and no security risks. It is purely a list of permission name constants.",
