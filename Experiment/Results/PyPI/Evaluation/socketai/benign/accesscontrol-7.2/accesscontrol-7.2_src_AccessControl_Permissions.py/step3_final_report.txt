  "purpose": "Static permission label definitions for a Zope application, serving as configuration constants.",
  "sources": "The code reads from predefined string constants assigned to permission variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code is purely static configuration.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the code consists solely of static assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static collection of string constants defining permissions, with no dynamic behavior, external data input, or code execution. All reports correctly identify the benign, configuration nature of the code. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static set of permission definitions with no malicious or suspicious elements. The security assessment is that it poses no threat, and the scores reflect this accurately.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
