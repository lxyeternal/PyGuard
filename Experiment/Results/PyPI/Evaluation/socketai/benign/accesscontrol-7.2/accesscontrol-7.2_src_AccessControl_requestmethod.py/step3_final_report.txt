  "purpose": "The code provides decorators for web request handlers, dynamically generating functions to enforce HTTP method restrictions based on function signatures.",
  "sources": "Signature inspection of handler functions, function name, and docstring.",
  "sinks": "exec() executes generated function definitions, creating new functions at runtime.",
  "flows": "Signature parameters are inspected; string representations of functions are built and executed via exec() to produce decorated functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() for dynamic code generation, which can be risky if inputs are manipulated, but in this context, inputs are controlled and static.",
  "analysis": "The code inspects function signatures, constructs function definitions as strings, and executes them with exec() to create decorators that restrict request methods. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity are present. The primary concern is the use of exec(), which poses a security risk if inputs are influenced externally. However, in this controlled context, the inputs are static and trusted. The code is a common pattern in web frameworks for request validation. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2-0.3) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of request method decorators using dynamic function creation. While exec() introduces some security considerations, it is used in a controlled manner here. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or malware is present. The scores assigned are justified and appropriate given the context.",
