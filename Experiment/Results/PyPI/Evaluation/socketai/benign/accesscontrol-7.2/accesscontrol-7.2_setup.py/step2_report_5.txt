  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report concludes the setup script is standard, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. It correctly notes that the code reads static files, defines a C extension with fixed source files, and sets package metadata.\n\n- **Code confirmation:** The code matches the description; no dynamic execution or untrusted input handling is present.\n\n- **Errors/Flaws:** None identified. The reasoning is sound.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 (very low, just acknowledging minimal inherent risk in package setup). This seems reasonable.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Fully aligned with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard setup patterns with no suspicious activity.\n\n- **Code confirmation:** The code is straightforward, matching the description.\n\n- **Errors/Flaws:** None.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0. The risk score is appropriate.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, the analysis indicates a typical setup script, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Code confirmation:** The code reads documentation files, defines extension modules, and sets dependencies, all standard.\n\n- **Errors/Flaws:** None.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0. The risk score is appropriate.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report states the script is standard, with no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n- **Code confirmation:** The code reads documentation files, defines extension modules, and sets package metadata—nothing suspicious.\n\n- **Errors/Flaws:** None.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0. The risk score seems reasonable.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar conclusion—standard setup script with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Code confirmation:** The code reads files, defines extension modules, and sets dependencies, all typical.\n\n- **Errors/Flaws:** None.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0. The risk score is appropriate.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of all reports:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the code analysis. No malicious behavior detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, which is correct; the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n\n- **Risk scores:** Mostly 0 or 0.1, reflecting the minimal inherent risk in package setup scripts. This is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard Python package setup script.**  \n**No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.**  \n**The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code.**\n\n---\n\n### My personal estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to reading files and executing setup, but nothing malicious)  \n\n**The code is safe, standard, and poses no security threat.**",
