{
  "purpose": "The code is a standard Python package setup script that reads static documentation files, defines a C extension module, and sets package metadata and dependencies. It serves to configure and install the package without executing untrusted code or performing malicious actions.",
  "sources": "Reading static files ('README.rst', 'CHANGES.rst'), defining extension modules with fixed source files, setting package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution present; no sinks that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Static file reads and package configuration flow without dynamic or untrusted data passing to any sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup.py script for a Python package, involving static file reading, defining a C extension with fixed source files, and setting metadata and dependencies. No dynamic code, untrusted input, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The scores assigned in all reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate given the static and benign nature of the script. The code poses no security threat and is typical for package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, well-structured, and free of malicious or suspicious behavior. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the assigned scores are justified and consistent with the code.",
