{
  "purpose": "Helper functions and class for handling input and output operations in a CLI tool for encryption/decryption using aws_encryption_sdk.",
  "sources": "Reads from sys.stdin, sys.stdout, file paths for reading input files, and user input via input() for interactive prompts.",
  "sinks": "Writes to sys.stdout or files, including potentially overwritten files; uses os.remove to delete files upon failure.",
  "flows": "Reads data from stdin or files, processes through aws_encryption_sdk streams, writes to stdout or files; can delete files on failure.",
  "anomalies": "Uses user input to decide overwriting files; contains verbose logging; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious network activity; no obfuscated code; file deletion on error is typical but should be checked contextually.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard IO handling for encryption/decryption workflows, including directory traversal, file overwriting prompts, directory creation, and data wrapping with Base64. It interfaces with aws_encryption_sdk for cryptographic operations. No suspicious code patterns, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are apparent. The code performs expected file operations, input reading, and logging without any unusual or hidden behaviors. The only potential concern is interactive prompts and file deletion, which are typical for CLI tools but could be misused if misconfigured. Overall, the code appears legitimate, with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard input/output handler for a CLI encryption tool, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It carefully manages files, directories, and data streams without performing any suspicious activities or network operations. It is safe for use in its described context.",
