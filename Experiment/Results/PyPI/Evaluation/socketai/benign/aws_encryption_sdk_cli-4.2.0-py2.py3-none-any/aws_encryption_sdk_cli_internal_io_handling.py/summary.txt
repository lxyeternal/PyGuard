  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure component for handling encrypted files in a CLI environment. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage are present. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are justified. The low security risk score of 0.2 reflects typical file handling and user interaction, which are standard practices. Overall, the code is benign and appropriate for production use."
