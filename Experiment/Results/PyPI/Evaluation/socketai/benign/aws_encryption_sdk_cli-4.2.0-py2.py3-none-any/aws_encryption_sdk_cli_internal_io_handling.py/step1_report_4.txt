{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions and an IOHandler class to manage input/output operations for a CLI tool that performs encryption and decryption using AWS Encryption SDK, handling file and directory processing with options for base64 encoding/decoding and user prompts.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from stdin or file sources; retrieves environment variables implicitly; reads files from disk for encryption/decryption; receives user input for overwrite prompts.",
  "sinks": "Writes encrypted/decrypted data to stdout or files; writes metadata; potentially outputs logs and user prompts; reads file contents for processing.",
  "flows": "Source (file or stdin) -> aws_encryption_sdk stream (encrypt/decrypt) -> destination (stdout or file); user input prompts influence overwrite behavior; metadata written during stream handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code detected; no malicious network connections or data exfiltration functions; uses standard library and AWS SDK functions only; no unusual or suspicious logic beyond typical file handling and user prompts.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically manages file encryption/decryption tasks, including directory traversal, file existence checks, user prompts for overwrite, and optional base64 encoding. It uses established libraries (aws_encryption_sdk, six, attr) with no signs of malicious intent. Error handling for file existence and cleanup is standard. There are no indications of backdoors, data theft, or network communications outside AWS SDK usage, which is expected for the context. Overall, the code is designed for secure file handling and does not exhibit malicious or sabotage behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate utility for managing encryption and decryption workflows in a CLI environment. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware within this source. It adheres to expected patterns for secure file operations and user interaction.",
