  "purpose": "Helper functions and IO handling for a CLI tool performing encryption and decryption, including file operations, stream handling, and directory management.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from stdin or files; reads environment variables for environment setup; user input for interactive prompts.",
  "sinks": "Writes output to files or stdout; writes metadata; potentially overwrites or deletes files; logs warnings and info.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from stdin or files into encryption/decryption streams, then to output files or stdout. Metadata is written during processing. User decisions influence overwriting. Files are deleted upon failure.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network connections are present. Usage of standard library functions and open-source aws_encryption_sdk; no obfuscated code. Directory creation handles existing directories gracefully. No suspicious dynamic code execution or data exfiltration detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides IO handling for encryption/decryption workflows, including safe directory creation, file existence checks, and user prompts for overwriting files. Stream wrapping for base64 encoding/decoding uses established libraries. No malicious behavior such as network connections, data theft, or system damage is observed. The handling of file operations appears standard and secure. Error handling and cleanup procedures are appropriately implemented. There are no signs of code sabotage or hidden backdoors; all functionalities align with expected CLI utility behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured IO utility module for encryption/decryption operations, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It manages files and streams securely and interactively, following best practices for such tools.",
