  "purpose": "Helper functions and classes for handling input/output operations in a command-line encryption/decryption tool, including file management and stream processing.",
  "sources": "Reads input from stdin or files, and retrieves file sizes; writes output to stdout or files; checks file existence and overwrites.",
  "sinks": "Writes encrypted/decrypted data to output streams or files; writes metadata; may overwrite files based on user interaction.",
  "flows": "Input streams are processed through aws_encryption_sdk.stream, data flows from source files or stdin to encrypted/decrypted output files or stdout, with optional base64 encoding/decoding; metadata is written during processing.",
  "anomalies": "Uses interactive prompts for overwriting files; wraps streams with Base64IO based on flags; conditional handling for file existence; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; exception handling around file deletion and stream operations.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages input/output streams, file operations, and encryption SDK integration. It includes user prompts for overwriting files and handles directory creation. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or network communications. The use of the aws_encryption_sdk suggests legitimate cryptographic handling. No obfuscation techniques are present; the code is clear and maintainable. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns are detected. The only minor concern could be the interactive prompt, which could be exploited if user inputs are malicious, but this is standard and not malicious per se.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate component of a CLI encryption/decryption tool. It manages files, streams, and encryption SDK interactions securely. No malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
