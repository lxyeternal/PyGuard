  "purpose": "Configure AWS KMS master key providers based on CLI arguments, including validation and session setup.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'profile', 'region', 'discovery-account', 'discovery-partition' from kwargs; AWS SDK session creation.",
  "sinks": "Instantiation of provider objects (MRKAwareDiscoveryAwsKmsMasterKeyProvider or MRKAwareStrictAwsKmsMasterKeyProvider) which may perform internal network calls.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated and used to create AWS sessions; session info and parameters flow into provider object instantiation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity detected. Validation is appropriate.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard SDK configuration: handling user inputs for profile and region with validation, creating AWS sessions with a custom user agent, and instantiating provider objects. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data leakage are present. The potential network activity during provider instantiation is typical for AWS SDK operations and not malicious. Validation steps are correct, and no anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate, well-structured utility for configuring AWS KMS master key providers. It performs necessary validation, session setup, and object creation without any malicious intent or security issues. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate, and the slight risk score reflects normal SDK behavior involving network calls during provider instantiation.",
