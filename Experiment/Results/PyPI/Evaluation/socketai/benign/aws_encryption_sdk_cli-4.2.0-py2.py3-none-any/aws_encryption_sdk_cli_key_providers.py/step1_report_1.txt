{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to create AWS KMS master key providers with optional discovery and profile/region configurations for encryption SDK.",
  "sources": "Reads CLI arguments from kwargs, including 'profile', 'region', 'discovery-account', and 'discovery-partition'. Accesses 'USER_AGENT_SUFFIX' constant.",
  "sinks": "Creates AWS session objects with user agent override; instantiates master key provider classes with configured parameters.",
  "flows": "Retrieves 'profile' and 'region' from kwargs, sets up AWS botocore session, passes configuration to master key provider constructors.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious network activity. Proper validation of profile and region length with exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly handles parameter parsing, session creation, and instantiation of AWS KMS master key providers. It validates profile and region inputs, applies a custom user agent, and optionally sets a discovery filter based on accounts and partition. No hardcoded credentials, no data exfiltration, and no malicious behavior are evident. The logic is standard for SDK configuration. There are no signs of obfuscation or hidden malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured utility for configuring AWS KMS master key providers. No malicious intent or security risks are detected based on the provided code. It follows standard SDK configuration patterns without suspicious activity.",
