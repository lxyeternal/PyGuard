  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate, well-structured utility for configuring AWS KMS master key providers. It performs necessary validation, session setup, and object creation without any malicious intent or security issues. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate, and the slight risk score reflects normal SDK behavior involving network calls during provider instantiation."
