{
  "purpose": "Define complex type annotations and configuration structures for use with mypy and AWS encryption SDK.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library, aws_encryption_sdk, and conditional type definitions based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "None identified; code primarily defines type aliases and imports.",
  "flows": "Imports and type alias definitions are static and do not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. The use of conditional imports and type definitions is typical and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up type annotations and constants for use with mypy static type checking. It includes imports from standard library and aws_encryption_sdk, with some conditional logic based on Python version. No dynamic code execution, data handling, or untrusted input processing is present. The structure and content are consistent with library setup code, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for type annotation and configuration purposes in an AWS SDK context. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears safe and standard for its intended purpose.",
