  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard setup for type annotations and configuration constants in a Python project involving AWS Encryption SDK.\n- No external data input, network operations, or dynamic behaviors are present.\n- The code contains conditional imports for Python version compatibility and handles ImportError gracefully.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n**Confirmations and issues:**\n- The code does not process untrusted data or contain any data sinks or flows that could be exploited.\n- The purpose is purely declarative: defining types and constants for static type checking and configuration.\n- No errors, flaws, or mistakes are evident in the logic or reasoning.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- Malware score: consistently 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- Obfuscated score: 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- Risk score: 0, since there's no security risk or vulnerability.\n\n**Potential concerns:**\n- The only point to consider is the use of a try-except block that passes silently on ImportError. While common for optional dependencies, if the module is critical, this could cause issues, but in this context, it seems acceptable as the code is mainly for type annotations and setup.\n\n**Final evaluation:**\n- The code is safe, standard, and free of malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n- No changes are necessary to the scores.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign setup module for type annotations and configuration constants, with no security concerns. The scores given are appropriate and should remain as is.",
