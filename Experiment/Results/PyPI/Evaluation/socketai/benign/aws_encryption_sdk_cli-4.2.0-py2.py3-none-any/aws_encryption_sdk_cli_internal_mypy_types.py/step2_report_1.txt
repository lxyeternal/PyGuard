  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard setup for type annotations and configuration constants related to AWS Encryption SDK and mypy.\n- The code is primarily import statements, type alias definitions, and conditional handling for Python version compatibility.\n- No data processing, network operations, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The exception handling with `try-except` around imports is a common pattern for optional dependencies, not malicious.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code does **not** process untrusted data or include any sink points.\n- There are **no vulnerabilities** or malicious behaviors implied by the code.\n- The purpose is purely declarative: setting up type annotations and configuration constants.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0. This code does not contain any malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate; the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Any discrepancies or concerns?**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. No adjustments needed.\n- The reasoning in each report correctly identifies the code as safe, standard, and non-malicious.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- Given the code's purpose and content, I concur with the reports' conclusions.\n- The overall security risk is negligible.\n- The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set at 0.\n- The risk score remains at 0.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThis code is a standard, benign setup for type annotations and configuration constants in a Python project. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The reports are accurate and comprehensive.",
