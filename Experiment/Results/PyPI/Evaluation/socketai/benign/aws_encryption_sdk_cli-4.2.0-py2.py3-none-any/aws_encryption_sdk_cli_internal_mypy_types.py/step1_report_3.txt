{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations and configurations for use with mypy and AWS encryption SDK",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, aws_encryption_sdk, and aws_encryption_sdk.materials_managers.base",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; configuration variables are defined but not used for data processing",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted sources; mostly type definitions and imports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code structures; conditional import handling for compatibility",
  "analysis": "The code is mainly defining type annotations and configuration dictionaries for an AWS encryption SDK module. It conditionally imports modules based on Python version and wraps imports in a try-except block that passes on ImportError, which is a common pattern for optional dependencies. There are no user inputs, network calls, or data processing logic. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard for type hinting and configuration setup in a Python package. It contains no malicious or suspicious content and appears to be purely for type safety and configuration management.",
