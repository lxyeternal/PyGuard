  "purpose": "Define type annotations and configurations for use with mypy in the context of AWS encryption SDK.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'sys' and 'typing', and usage of external modules 'aws_encryption_sdk' and 'aws_encryption_sdk.materials_managers.base'. No external data input observed.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, output, or untrusted data handling points present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks, as the code only defines types and constants.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes conditional imports and definitions for different Python versions; no suspicious or unusual code patterns are observed. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily sets up type annotations and configuration constants for a Python project using mypy and AWS encryption SDK. It handles Python version differences and import errors gracefully. No external data processing, user input, or sensitive operations are present. The structure is typical for type annotation setup files. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malware signatures are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign setup for type annotations and configuration constants. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks within this module.",
