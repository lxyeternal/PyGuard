  "purpose": "Define type aliases and handle compatibility for mypy annotations related to AWS Encryption SDK configuration.",
  "sources": "Import statements, conditional imports for Python version compatibility, and type alias definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration and type definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import and type alias setup, no suspicious or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign setup module for static type annotations, involving imports, type alias definitions, and Python version compatibility handling. It contains no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The exception handling is standard for optional dependencies. No secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are accurate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard configuration setup for type annotations with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are justified and should remain as is.",
