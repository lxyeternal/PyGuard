  "purpose": "Define complex type constructions for use with mypy annotations in an AWS encryption SDK context.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'sys', 'typing', 'aws_encryption_sdk', and 'aws_encryption_sdk.materials_managers.base'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no outputs or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Imports and type definitions are static, no runtime data flows involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard type alias definitions and conditional imports.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports modules and defines type aliases for static type checking with mypy. It includes conditional logic based on Python version for type compatibility. No user input handling, no external data processing, and no dynamic code execution are present. All code appears to be for type annotation purposes and is non-executable in a malicious context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup for type annotations and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It is part of a larger SDK and is purely for type hinting.",
