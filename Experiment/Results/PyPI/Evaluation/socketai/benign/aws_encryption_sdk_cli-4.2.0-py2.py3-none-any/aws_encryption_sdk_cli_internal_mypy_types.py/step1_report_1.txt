{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations and configuration constants for use with AWS Encryption SDK and mypy type checking.",
  "sources": "Imports external modules and defines constants; no data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; the code mainly defines types and constants.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only sets up type annotations and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behavior detected; the code is standard for type annotations and configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import modules and define type annotation constants for AWS SDK and mypy usage. It includes conditional handling for Python version differences and an ImportError exception for non-compatibility scenarios. There are no data inputs, network operations, or data manipulations that could be malicious. The code's purpose is purely declarative, related to type annotations and configuration schemas. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for type annotations and configuration constants in a Python project using AWS encryption SDK. It contains no malicious intent, no data leaks, and no security risks.",
