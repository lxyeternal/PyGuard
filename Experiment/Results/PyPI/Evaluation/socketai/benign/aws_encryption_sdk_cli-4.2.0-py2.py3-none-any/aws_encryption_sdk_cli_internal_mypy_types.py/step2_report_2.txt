  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is a set of type alias definitions and import statements intended for static type checking with mypy.\n- It includes conditional handling for Python version differences.\n- It wraps imports in a try-except block, passing on ImportError, which is a common pattern for optional dependencies.\n- No data processing, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors.\n- The purpose is purely declarative, supporting type annotations and configuration constants for AWS SDK integration.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **No.** All reports conclude that the code is standard setup code with no malicious or security concerns, which aligns with the code's content.\n\n- **Are there errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  **No.** The code appears syntactically correct, with proper handling of Python version differences and import errors.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n- **Are any risk scores higher than 0.5 justified?**  \n  No. The code is purely for type annotations and configuration; no malicious or risky behaviors are present.\n\n- **Are malware scores justified?**  \n  **Yes, malware score of 0** is justified. No malicious activity is detected.\n\n- **Are claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \n  No. The reports correctly identify the code as benign setup code.\n\n- **Are the scores consistent?**  \n  Yes. All scores align with the code's purpose and content.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The code is standard for a Python project that uses mypy and AWS SDK, with no suspicious or malicious elements.\n- The use of conditional imports and exception handling is common and not malicious.\n- No obfuscation, secrets, or data flows that could be exploited.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, since it's just setup code, but some might argue even configuration code has negligible risk; still, it's negligible and appropriate to keep at 0)\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign, standard setup for type annotations and configuration constants. No security issues, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
