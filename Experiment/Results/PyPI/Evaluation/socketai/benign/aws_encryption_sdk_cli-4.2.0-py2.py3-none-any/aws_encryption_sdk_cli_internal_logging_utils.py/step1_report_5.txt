{
  "purpose": "The code provides logging utilities, including custom formatters and filters, to redact sensitive KMS data in logs for secure logging practices.",
  "sources": "The code reads static configuration variables, imported modules, and logging record data (headers, bodies, messages) during execution.",
  "sinks": "Logging outputs, where log records are formatted and potentially contain sensitive data redacted from KMS requests and responses.",
  "flows": "Logging record creation -> Filtering and detection of KMS request/response -> Redaction of sensitive fields -> Formatting and output to logs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious data flows. The code performs standard logging customization with redaction logic. No obfuscated or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script defines custom log formatters and filters to redact 'Plaintext' values from KMS request and response logs, ensuring sensitive data is not exposed. It utilizes deep copies of log records for safe modifications and applies regex/string checks for specific KMS request/response patterns. No code injection, external data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The usage of standard libraries and straightforward logic indicates benign intent, focusing solely on secure logging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate logging utility designed for secure handling of KMS-related logs, with built-in redaction to protect sensitive information. No malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious behavior identified.",
