{
  "purpose": "Provides logging utilities, including a custom formatter to redact sensitive KMS request/response data, and sets up logging configurations.",
  "sources": "Reading configuration variables, importing modules, and class/method definitions. No external input reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "Logging output generated by the formatter and logger setup, which potentially could include redacted sensitive information, but no direct data leakage or malicious output is evident.",
  "flows": "Code initializes logger and formatter objects, processes logging records to potentially redact KMS plaintext data, and outputs formatted logs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets (except redaction placeholder), or suspicious behaviors observed. No external data input or network operations are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a logging utility with custom formatters and filters, specifically designed to redact sensitive KMS request/response data. It only processes log records, redacting plaintext fields from KMS-related logs. No user input, network activity, or external data handling is present. The code's purpose is to enhance security by preventing sensitive data leakage in logs. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate logging utility focused on redacting sensitive KMS data from logs. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks within this module.",
