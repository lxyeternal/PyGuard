  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, security-focused logging utility designed to prevent leakage of sensitive KMS plaintext data. It contains no malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. The low security risk score reflects the minimal threat, primarily the potential for log redaction failure if log formats change. The malware score is 0, and the obfuscated score is 0, indicating clear, straightforward code. The overall security posture is sound and appropriate for its purpose."
