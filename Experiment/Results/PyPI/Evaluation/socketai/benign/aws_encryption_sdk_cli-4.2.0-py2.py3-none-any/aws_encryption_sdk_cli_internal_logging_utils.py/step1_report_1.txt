  "purpose": "Logging utility tooling for handling and redacting sensitive KMS request and response data in logs.",
  "sources": "Logging records generated during KMS encryption requests and responses, particularly in 'botocore' library logs.",
  "sinks": "Redacted log output; does not write to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "Log records are intercepted, analyzed for specific KMS-related messages, and sensitive data like 'Plaintext' fields are redacted before being output.",
  "anomalies": "The code redacts 'Plaintext' data from KMS requests and responses, which is expected for security but could be misused to obscure sensitive info if logs are manipulated. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a logging formatter that specifically identifies and redacts plaintext data in KMS encrypt requests and responses, which helps prevent leaking sensitive encryption keys or plaintext data in logs. It uses safe JSON parsing and string handling. The filtering and formatting logic is straightforward, with no evidence of malicious behavior. The code employs deep copying for safe record handling. The logger setup includes a blacklist filter to prevent certain loggers from propagating logs. No external network access or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The redaction is targeted and does not modify other data, reducing risk of concealment of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a security-focused logging utility designed to redact sensitive KMS data from logs. There is no indication of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. The code appears well-structured and safe, with clear intent to prevent sensitive data leakage via logs.",
