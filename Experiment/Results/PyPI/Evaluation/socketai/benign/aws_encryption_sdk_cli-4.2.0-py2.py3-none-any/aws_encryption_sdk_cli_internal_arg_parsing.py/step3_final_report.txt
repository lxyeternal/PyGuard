{
  "purpose": "The code provides CLI argument parsing, validation, and configuration processing for an AWS Encryption SDK tool, ensuring correct user input and setup.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (via os.path.expandvars), command-line arguments, configuration lists and key-value pairs.",
  "sinks": "Potentially expanded environment variables, but primarily internal data structures and validation functions; no data leaks or external effects observed.",
  "flows": "Input arguments and environment variables are parsed and validated; configuration data flows through parsing functions into internal structures; no external network or data exfiltration occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.path.expandvars could be exploited if environment variables are maliciously set, but this is standard in CLI tools and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard CLI argument parser with validation routines, environment variable expansion, and configuration handling. No suspicious or malicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: ~0.2) are consistent with the code's transparency and purpose. The use of environment variable expansion is typical but should be noted as a minor potential vector if environment variables are maliciously manipulated. Overall, the code is safe, well-structured, and free of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate CLI argument and configuration handler with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low risk score appropriately reflects the standard operations involved. The assigned scores are justified and consistent with the code's functionality.",
