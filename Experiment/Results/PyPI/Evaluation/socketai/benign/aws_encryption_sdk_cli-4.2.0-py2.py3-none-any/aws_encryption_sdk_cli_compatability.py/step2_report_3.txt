  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward version check and warning issuance script.\n- It imports standard modules (`sys`, `warnings`) and performs no dynamic code execution, network calls, or data manipulation.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The purpose is to inform users about deprecated Python versions, which is a common, benign practice.\n- No signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks are evident.\n\n**Specific review of each report:**\n\n---\n\n### Report 1:\n- **Assessment:** Correctly states that the code checks Python versions and issues warnings.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** None observed.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0.1 seem reasonable; the slight security risk score is due to warning issuance, but this is minimal.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, benign utility code.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2:\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; accurate and detailed.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0.1 are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3:\n- **Assessment:** Correct; detailed explanation matches the code's behavior.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0.1 are reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4:\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; the logic is standard.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0.0 or 0.1 is acceptable; the code is benign.\n- **Conclusion:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5:\n- **Assessment:** Correct; notes the code is benign.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0.1 seem appropriate.\n- **Confidence is slightly lower (0.9), but still acceptable.**\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** Given the code's benign nature, a risk score of 0.1 is acceptable; it's a minimal warning mechanism.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (or possibly 0, since the code is entirely benign)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are accurate, and their reasoning is sound. The scores are reasonable, reflecting the benign nature of the code. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nThis code is a standard, well-understood pattern for deprecation warnings, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores appropriately reflect its benign intent.",
