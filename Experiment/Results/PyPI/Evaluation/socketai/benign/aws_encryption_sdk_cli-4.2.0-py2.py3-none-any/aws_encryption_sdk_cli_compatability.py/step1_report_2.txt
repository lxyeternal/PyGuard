{
  "purpose": "To check Python version compatibility and issue deprecation warnings if the running Python version is outdated.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info (reads current Python version), warnings.warn (potentially outputs warnings).",
  "targets": "The warnings module outputs messages to the user; no untrusted data flow involved.",
  "flows": "Python version info is read from sys.version_info; if deprecated, a warning is generated and shown via warnings.warn.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard deprecation warning pattern. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports system and warnings modules, defines a map for deprecation dates, and includes a function to warn users about deprecated Python versions. The function checks the current Python version against a list of deprecated versions and issues a warning if applicable. There is no input/output manipulation beyond standard warning output. No external network calls, no data exfiltration, no backdoors or malicious actions are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a straightforward version check and issues deprecation warnings. It appears to be a benign, standard version management utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
