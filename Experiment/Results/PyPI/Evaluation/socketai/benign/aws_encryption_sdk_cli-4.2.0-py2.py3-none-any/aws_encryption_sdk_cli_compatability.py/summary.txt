  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for issuing deprecation warnings based on Python version. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score should be 0 or very close to zero. Slightly elevated scores (e.g., 0.1) are acceptable but can be lowered to 0 for precision."
