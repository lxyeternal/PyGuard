{
  "purpose": "The code provides a utility for checking and warning about deprecated Python versions related to the AWS Encryption SDK.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Python interpreter version via sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "The code uses warnings.warn to notify users about deprecation, which can be seen as a benign user notification.",
  "flows": "sys.version_info is read to determine Python version -> warnings.warn is called if version is deprecated.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The warning mechanism is standard and does not contain obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys and warnings modules, defines a map for deprecation dates, and includes a function that checks the current Python version against a list of deprecated versions. If the version matches, it issues a deprecation warning with relevant details. The logic is straightforward, and there are no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. The purpose appears to be to inform users about deprecated Python versions for the AWS Encryption SDK support policy.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for issuing deprecation warnings about Python versions. There are no malicious behaviors, data leaks, or suspicious activities detected.",
