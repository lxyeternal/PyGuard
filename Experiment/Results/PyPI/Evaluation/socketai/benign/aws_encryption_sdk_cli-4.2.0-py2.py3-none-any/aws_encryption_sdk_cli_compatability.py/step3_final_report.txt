  "purpose": "Check Python version and issue deprecation warnings for outdated Python versions.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info for current Python version.",
  "sinks": "warnings.warn() to emit deprecation warnings.",
  "flows": "sys.version_info → version check → warnings.warn() if deprecated.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward version check and warning issuance.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, defines a map of deprecation dates, and issues warnings if the current Python version matches deprecated versions. It performs no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data manipulation. The logic is transparent, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The warnings are informational and benign, intended to inform users about deprecated Python versions. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code are present. The code's purpose is purely advisory, with no security implications beyond standard deprecation notices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for issuing deprecation warnings based on Python version. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score should be 0 or very close to zero. Slightly elevated scores (e.g., 0.1) are acceptable but can be lowered to 0 for precision.",
