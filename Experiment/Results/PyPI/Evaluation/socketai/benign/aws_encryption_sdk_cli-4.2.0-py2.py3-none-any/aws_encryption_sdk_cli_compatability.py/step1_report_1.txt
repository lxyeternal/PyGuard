{
  "purpose": "The code checks Python version compatibility and issues deprecation warnings for unsupported versions of Python.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current Python version from sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "The warnings.warn() function outputs deprecation warnings to the user; no data leaks or malicious actions are evident.",
  "flows": "The code flows from checking sys.version_info to issuing a warning via warnings.warn() based on the version.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior observed. The code performs standard version checking and warning issuance.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys and warnings modules, defines a version-to-deprecation date map, and contains a function that checks if the current Python version is deprecated. If so, it constructs a warning message and issues it via warnings.warn(). The logic is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, external data fetching, or malicious activity. No hardcoded credentials or hidden backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version compatibility check with deprecation warnings, exhibiting no malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign utility script for informing users about Python version support status.",
