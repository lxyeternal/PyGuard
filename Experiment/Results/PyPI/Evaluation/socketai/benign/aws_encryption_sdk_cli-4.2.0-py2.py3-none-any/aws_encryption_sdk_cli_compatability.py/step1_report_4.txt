  "purpose": "To check Python version deprecation and issue warnings accordingly",
  "sources": "Reads system version info from sys.version_info",
  "sinks": "Issues warnings via warnings.warn()",
  "flows": "sys.version_info -> _warn_deprecated_python() -> warnings.warn()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears to perform standard deprecation warnings",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys and warnings modules to determine the current Python version. It defines a map for deprecation dates for different Python major versions. The function _warn_deprecated_python() checks if the current Python version is deprecated based on a predefined list. If so, it constructs a warning message indicating deprecation and instructing users to upgrade Python, then issues this warning via warnings.warn(). The logic is straightforward, with no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious intent. The code only manages deprecation warnings, which is a standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard deprecation warnings for outdated Python versions. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected. It is typical version management code with no malicious intent.",
