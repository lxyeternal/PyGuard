{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to check Python version compatibility and issue deprecation warnings for unsupported Python versions in the context of the AWS Encryption SDK.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current Python version from sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "The warnings.warn function, which outputs a deprecation warning message.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves Python version info, checks it against a list of deprecated versions, and if a match is found, issues a warning via warnings.warn.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs standard version checking and warning issuance without suspicious or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the sys module to access Python version info and warnings to issue warnings. It defines a mapping for deprecation dates. The function _warn_deprecated_python() checks if the current Python version is in the deprecated list and, if so, issues a DeprecationWarning with detailed information. The logic is straightforward, uses standard Python practices, and does not include any hidden or malicious operations. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. The purpose is solely to warn users about deprecated Python versions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version deprecation warning utility for the AWS SDK, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It performs version checks and issues warnings responsibly without side effects or malicious actions.",
