  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the same core functionality: checking Python version via `sys.version_info` and issuing a deprecation warning via `warnings.warn()` if the version is outdated.\n- The code is straightforward, using standard Python modules, with no obfuscated code, external data fetching, or dynamic code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious logic are present.\n- The purpose is benign: informing users about deprecated Python versions in the context of the AWS Encryption SDK.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious activity, backdoors, or data leaks.\n- It performs standard version compatibility checks and warnings.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are observed.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- The logic is correct and standard for deprecation warnings.\n- The only minor point is that the `DEPRECATION_DATE_MAP` uses string dates, which are fine, but there's no issue with that.\n- The `deprecated_versions` dictionary maps specific Python versions to deprecation dates, which is correct.\n\n### Score review:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports — **correct**.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 for all reports — **correct**.\n- **Security risk score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports, which seems reasonable given that the code outputs warnings, but these are benign notifications. The risk is minimal, so a score of 0.1 is acceptable.\n- **Overall risk score:** The reports assign a 0.1 or 0.2, which seems reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code only reads system info and issues warnings, the **risk score** should remain very low, around 0.0 to 0.1.\n- No reason to increase the risk score unless malicious intent or vulnerabilities are present.\n\n### Malware score:\n- The malware score is correctly assigned as 0 in all reports, as no malicious activity is observed.\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:\n- The reports assume that issuing warnings is harmless, which is correct.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified; the code is straightforward.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- Slight variations in the reported confidence (1.0 vs 0.9) are minor and do not impact the overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on all reports and the code analysis:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, benign warning issuance)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.05 (very low, as it's just a version check and warning)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard, benign utility for deprecation warnings. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, and I agree with them.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed. The code is safe and non-malicious.",
