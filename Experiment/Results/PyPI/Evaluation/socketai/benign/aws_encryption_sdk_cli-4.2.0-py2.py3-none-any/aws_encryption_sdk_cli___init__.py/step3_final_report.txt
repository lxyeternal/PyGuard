  "purpose": "A CLI utility for AWS Encryption SDK that manages file and directory encryption/decryption with extensive validation and logging.",
  "sources": "Filesystem paths, stdin (\"-\") for input, environment variables for configuration, and imported SDK modules.",
  "sinks": "File outputs, stdout (\"-\") for output, and internal SDK functions that process encryption/decryption.",
  "flows": "Input sources (files, directories, stdin) are validated and then passed to SDK functions via handler methods; output destinations are validated before writing; validation functions prevent path traversal and overwriting issues.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic behaviors; validation functions are thorough; no obfuscation or network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured CLI wrapper for AWS Encryption SDK, focusing on input validation, argument parsing, and orchestrating SDK calls. It does not contain any malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation. Validation functions ensure safe filesystem operations, and exception handling is standard. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and structure. No signs of supply chain risks or malicious intent are present in the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure, and well-validated CLI utility for AWS Encryption SDK operations. No malicious or obfuscated behaviors are evident. The low security risk score is appropriate given the code's functionality and validation measures.",
