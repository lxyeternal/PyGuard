  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for AWS Encryption SDK CLI error handling.",
  "sources": "No data input, external data sources, or dynamic code execution; class definitions are static.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external communication; exception classes are used internally for error handling.",
  "flows": "N/A; static class definitions with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, standard exception class definitions with licensing comments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from Python's Exception, with descriptive docstrings. It contains no input/output, data handling, network activity, or dynamic execution. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are present. The code is standard for error handling in CLI tools. All reports agree on its benign nature, with high confidence scores (1), malware scores (0), and security risk scores (0). The code's simplicity and clarity confirm the absence of security issues or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk elements. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent. No further action or suspicion is warranted.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
