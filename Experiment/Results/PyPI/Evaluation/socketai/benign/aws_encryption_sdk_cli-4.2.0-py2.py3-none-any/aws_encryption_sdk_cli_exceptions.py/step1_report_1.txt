  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for use in AWS Encryption SDK CLI.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink since there are no input or output operations.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to be straightforward class definitions for exceptions, with no unusual code patterns or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class declarations inheriting from Exception, used for error handling within a CLI tool. It does not contain any external data handling, network communication, or dynamic code execution. The structure is standard for custom exceptions and shows no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes for a CLI tool. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks.",
