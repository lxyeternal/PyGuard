  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - The code defines four custom exception classes inheriting from Python's `Exception`.\n   - All classes are straightforward, with descriptive docstrings.\n   - There are no input/output operations, external data handling, network communication, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The code includes licensing comments, which are standard and benign.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n   - No external dependencies, data flows, or code behaviors that could be exploited.\n   - The code is purely definitional, serving as part of an error handling mechanism in a CLI tool.\n\n3. **Assessment of the Reports**:\n   - All reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious behavior.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, indicating high certainty.\n   - The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - The security risk scores are 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n   - No anomalies or unusual patterns are identified.\n\n4. **Score Justification and Recommendations**:\n   - The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all appropriate at 0.\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate regarding the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- The code is a standard, straightforward implementation of custom exception classes.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are justified and accurate.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus in the reports.",
