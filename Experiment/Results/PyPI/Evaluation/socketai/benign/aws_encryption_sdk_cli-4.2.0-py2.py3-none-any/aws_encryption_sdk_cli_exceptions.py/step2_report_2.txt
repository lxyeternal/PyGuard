  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:  \n   The provided code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from Python's `Exception`. There are no input/output operations, no data processing, no external dependencies, no network communication, and no dynamic code execution. The classes are straightforward and include descriptive docstrings.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:  \n   The code is standard for defining custom exceptions in a CLI tool. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are evident. The license comments are standard and do not indicate malicious intent.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports**:  \n   All five reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and has no security issues. They correctly identify that the code is purely definitional, with no external data handling or suspicious patterns. The confidence scores are all 1, which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n4. **Scores and Justification**:  \n   - **Malware Score**: 0 across all reports is appropriate. No malicious activity or code is present.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score**: 0 is correct; there's no obfuscation.  \n   - **Security Risk Score**: 0 is justified; the code does not introduce any security vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns**:  \n   Since all reports are consistent and accurate, there is no need to adjust the scores. The code is benign and does not pose any security threat.\n\n6. **Overall Conclusion**:  \n   Based on the code and reports, I agree with the assessments: the code is standard, harmless, and contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My own estimate** after reviewing everything:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Final notes**:  \nThe code is a textbook example of exception class definitions with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent. No further action or suspicion is warranted.",
