  "flows": "No data flow; purely class definitions for exception handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward exception class definitions with no dynamic code or external dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class declarations for the AWS Encryption SDK CLI. It contains no input/output handling, no dynamic execution, no environment variable usage, and no suspicious or malicious code patterns. All classes inherit from built-in Exception and are used for error handling, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, legitimate set of custom exception class definitions with no malicious behavior or security concerns.",
