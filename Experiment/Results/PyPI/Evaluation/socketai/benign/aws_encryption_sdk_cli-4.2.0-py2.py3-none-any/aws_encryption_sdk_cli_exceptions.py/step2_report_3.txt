  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from Python's `Exception`.\n   - There are no input/output operations, data handling, external communications, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are evident.\n   - The code is straightforward, standard for defining custom exceptions in a CLI tool.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is benign, purely definitional, and contains no security risks.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are apparent in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - The `confidence` score is 1, which is justified based on the clear, straightforward nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The risk scores are all 0, which aligns with the benign assessment.\n   - No justification is needed for higher scores, as the code shows no security issues.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n   - There is no malicious activity, code injection, or suspicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as simple exception class definitions.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature and the detailed analysis.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Security Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\nGiven the code's simplicity and benign nature, I concur with the existing scores. There is no indication of malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes with no security concerns.",
