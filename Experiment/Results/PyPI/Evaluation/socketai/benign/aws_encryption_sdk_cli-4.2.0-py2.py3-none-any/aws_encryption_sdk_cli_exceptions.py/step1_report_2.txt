  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the AWS Encryption SDK CLI tool.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths since the code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual behaviors detected. The code is straightforward class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from the base Exception class. There are no input sources, no data processing, no external interactions, and no suspicious or malicious code behaviors. It is a typical pattern for defining exceptions in Python modules, specifically for CLI error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard, benign, and serves as part of a larger CLI utility. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
