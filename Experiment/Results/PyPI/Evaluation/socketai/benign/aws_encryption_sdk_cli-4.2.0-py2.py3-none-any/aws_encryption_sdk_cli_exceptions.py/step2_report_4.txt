  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:  \n   The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from Python's built-in `Exception`. There are no input/output operations, data processing, external communication, or dynamic code execution. The classes are straightforward and include descriptive docstrings.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:  \n   The reports uniformly state that the code is benign, standard, and contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. This assessment aligns with the code content, which is simple exception class definitions.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that there are no anomalies, no external data handling, and no suspicious code patterns. No errors or logical flaws are evident in the reports.\n\n4. **Scores Review and Justification**:  \n   - **Obfuscated Score (0)**: Correct, as the code is straightforward and lacks obfuscation.  \n   - **Malware Score (0)**: Correct, no malicious behavior or code is present.  \n   - **Security Risk Score (0)**: Correct, no vulnerabilities or security issues are apparent.  \n   - **Confidence (1)**: Justified, given the clear and benign nature of the code.\n\n5. **Potential Risks and Justification for Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since the code is purely definitional for exception handling with no external or dynamic elements, there's no reason to assign any higher scores for malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n\n6. **Challenge Any Assumptions**:  \n   The reports assume that exception class definitions are inherently safe, which is valid. No assumptions about hidden malicious behavior are made, and this aligns with the code.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n### Additional Remarks:\n\nGiven the simplicity and clarity of the code, I concur with the reports' evaluations. The code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exception classes for a CLI tool, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Summary**:  \n- The code is safe, straightforward, and typical for its purpose.  \n- No changes needed to the reported scores.  \n- The overall security posture based on this code is benign.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:  \nMaintain the current scoring and conclude that this code poses no security concern.",
