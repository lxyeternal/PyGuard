  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from Python's built-in `Exception`.\n   - There are no input/output operations, data handling, network communication, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The code includes licensing comments, which are standard and benign.\n   - The exception classes are straightforward, with descriptive docstrings, serving as error handling mechanisms within a CLI tool.\n\n2. **Security and Malicious Behavior:**\n   - No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n   - No external data sources or sinks are involved.\n   - No suspicious patterns or behaviors are present.\n   - The code does not contain any hardcoded secrets or dynamic behaviors that could be exploited.\n\n3. **Assessment of the Reports:**\n   - All reports uniformly describe the code as standard, benign, and straightforward.\n   - They correctly identify that there are no external data flows, no obfuscation, and no malicious intent.\n   - The confidence scores are high (1), which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - Malware scores are 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - Security risk scores are also 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - The malware score of 0 is justified; there's no indication of malicious activity.\n   - The obfuscated score of 0 is correct; the code is clear and readable.\n   - The security risk score of 0 is appropriate; no vulnerabilities or security concerns are evident.\n\n5. **Potential for Adjustments:**\n   - Given the clear and benign nature of the code, no score adjustments are necessary.\n   - The reports' conclusions are consistent with the code content.\n\n**Final Evaluation:**\n- The code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exception classes.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements are present.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My Overall Estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is purely definitional, with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports accurately reflect the benign nature of the code.",
