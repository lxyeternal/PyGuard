  "sources": "pkg_resources.iter_entry_points, provider configuration arguments, environment variables (indirectly via provider load functions).",
  "sinks": "Loading provider classes/functions, instantiating key provider objects.",
  "flows": "Discovery of entry points -> loading provider classes -> instantiation with parameters -> adding master keys -> assembling into crypto manager.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard plugin discovery via pkg_resources, dynamically loads provider classes, and constructs cryptographic manager objects. It contains no malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The reliance on external plugins introduces trust considerations but is typical for plugin systems. No hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads are present. The malware score is appropriately zero; the low security risk score reflects the potential risk if untrusted plugins are registered, which is inherent to plugin architectures but not a flaw in the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign plugin management utility for AWS Encryption SDK, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal and primarily depends on plugin trustworthiness. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
