{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a generated Python module for the Apache Airflow provider, primarily setting version information and enforcing version requirements.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, packaging.version, airflow.__version__",
  "sinks": "Potential RuntimeError raise if Airflow version is below 2.9.0",
  "flows": "Import airflow version -> parse airflow version -> compare with 2.9.0 -> raise RuntimeError if condition met",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The version check is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports versioning libraries and checks the installed Airflow version against a minimum required version. It raises an error if the version is incompatible. No external input or untrusted data sources are used; the code functions as a version guard. All imported modules are standard, and there are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, auto-generated version check and import setup for a Python package. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are present. It performs a straightforward version comparison to enforce compatibility.",
