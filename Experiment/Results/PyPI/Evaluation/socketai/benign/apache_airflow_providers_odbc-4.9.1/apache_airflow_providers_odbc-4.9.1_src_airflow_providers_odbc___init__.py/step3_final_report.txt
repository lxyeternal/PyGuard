{
  "purpose": "This code performs a version check to ensure the installed Apache Airflow version meets the minimum required version (2.9.0).",
  "sources": "It reads the installed airflow.__version__ from the airflow module.",
  "sinks": "The code raises a RuntimeError if the version requirement is not met, which is a control flow sink for enforcing dependencies.",
  "flows": "The source (airflow.__version__) is compared against a hardcoded version string; if the condition fails, it triggers an exception.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, auto-generated, and performs a standard dependency validation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version parsing library, retrieves the current airflow version, and compares it to a minimum required version. If the installed version is below 2.9.0, it raises an exception. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or external data manipulation. The logic is simple and standard for dependency enforcement, with no network activity or data leakage. The code's clarity and purpose are evident, and it relies solely on trusted modules and static version checks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated dependency version check with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs a standard validation to prevent incompatible versions, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity.",
