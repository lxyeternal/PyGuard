{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be an auto-generated module that sets the version of an Apache Airflow provider package and enforces a minimum Airflow version requirement.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Airflow version from the imported airflow.__version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "The code raises a RuntimeError if the Airflow version is below 2.9.0; no other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The source (airflow.__version__) flows into a version check that may trigger an exception if the condition is met.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no unusual or suspicious constructs; it is a straightforward version check with auto-generated comments.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, defines package version info, and compares the current Airflow version with a minimum required version. If the version is too low, it raises an exception. The code is typical for ensuring compatibility, with no indications of obfuscated or malicious behavior. It does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or system modifications. The use of version parsing and exception raising is standard practice in version enforcement.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard auto-generated version check for compatibility, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It enforces a minimum Airflow version and raises an error if unmet. There are no suspicious behaviors or anomalies.",
