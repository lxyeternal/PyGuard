{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be an auto-generated Python module for an Apache Airflow provider, mainly setting version information and performing a version check.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Airflow version from the imported __version__ attribute and the local __version__ string.",
  "sinks": "The version comparison and potential RuntimeError could be triggered based on untrusted or manipulated __version__ data, but this is standard version validation.",
  "flows": "The airflow_version is read and parsed; if it is less than 2.9.0, a RuntimeError is raised.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code performs a straightforward version check and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'packaging.version' module and the Airflow version. It defines a version string and checks if the imported airflow_version's base version is less than 2.9.0; if so, it raises an error. The logic is standard for dependency validation. No input or untrusted data sources are involved outside the version string. No suspicious behavior or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign version check script for package compatibility. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It simply ensures the runtime environment meets the specified version requirements.",
