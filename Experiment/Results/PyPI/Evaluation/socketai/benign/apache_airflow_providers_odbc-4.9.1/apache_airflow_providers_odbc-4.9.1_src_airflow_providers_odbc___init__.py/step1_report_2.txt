{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a generated module for an Apache Airflow provider, mainly handling version validation and imports.",
  "sources": "Import statements for __future__, packaging.version, and airflow version info, along with the inline version string __version__.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks or external output operations. The only notable action is raising an exception if version conditions are not met.",
  "flows": "The code parses the airflow_version from the airflow module, compares it to a static version string, and potentially raises an exception based on this comparison.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs a version check and raises an exception if the condition is met. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code is present. The code is straightforward, generated, and contains no obfuscated or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code imports required modules, defines version variables, and performs a version check that raises a RuntimeError if airflow_version is below 2.9.0. The check uses nested parsing of the version string, but this is a common pattern for version validation. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no external network or file I/O, and no suspicious code or malicious behavior. The code is static, straightforward, and intended to enforce a version requirement.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, automatically generated version check for a package dependency. It contains no malicious intent, no malicious or suspicious code, and no security risks beyond normal version validation. The overall security risk is very low.",
