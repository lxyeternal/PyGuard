  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is a straightforward auto-generated version check, importing standard modules, defining a version string, and raising a RuntimeError if the installed Airflow version is below 2.9.0.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** No signs of malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Security Risk:** The check is standard and safe.\n- **Score justification:** The score of 0 for malware and 0.5 for security risk seems appropriate. The code performs a benign version check with no external data or suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, with a detailed analysis confirming the straightforward nature of the version validation.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** None detected.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low, standard version enforcement.\n- **Score justification:** The report assigns a security risk of 0.1, which is reasonable considering the code raises an exception based on version validation, but this is a common pattern.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent or security concern.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, a typical version check, importing the airflow version, comparing, and raising an exception if below 2.9.0.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** No signs.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low.\n- **Score justification:** The score of 0.1 for security risk is appropriate, given the benign nature of the code.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern, standard dependency validation.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** None.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low.\n- **Score justification:** Consistent with other reports.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar auto-generated version validation code.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** No.\n- **Security Risk:** No.\n- **Score justification:** Appropriate to assign low scores.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- **Code presence of malicious or suspicious behavior:** None.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Malware:** Zero across all reports.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, consistent with standard version validation code.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and align with the code's behavior.\n- The code is standard, auto-generated, and performs a benign version check.\n- No adjustments needed based on the provided reports.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, standard version validation, no security concern)\n\nThis assessment confirms that the code is safe, standard, and does not pose any security threat.",
