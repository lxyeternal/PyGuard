{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be an auto-generated initialization script for an Apache Airflow provider package, mainly setting version compatibility and metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment information via imported modules and the Airflow version variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leaks or untrusted data processing are present.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves version checking of the Airflow environment and raising an error if the version is too low.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs standard version validation and metadata setting.",
  "analysis": "The script is straightforward, importing necessary modules, setting version variables, and enforcing a version constraint for compatibility. It raises an exception if the Airflow version is below 2.9.0, which is standard practice. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical auto-generated package initialization file used for version validation and metadata, with no malicious intent or security risks.",
