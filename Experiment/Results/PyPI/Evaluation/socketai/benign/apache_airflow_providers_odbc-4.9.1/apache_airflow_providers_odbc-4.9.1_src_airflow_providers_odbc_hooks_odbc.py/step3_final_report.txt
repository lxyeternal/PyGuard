  "purpose": "Provides a database connection hook for ODBC data sources, constructing connection strings dynamically from configuration and parameters.",
  "sources": "Connection parameters, connection extras, constructor arguments, environment/configuration variables.",
  "sinks": "pyodbc.connect, SQLAlchemy engine creation, URI generation, connection string assembly.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (parameters, extras) flow into connection string and URI construction, leading to database connection objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Connection string built from user-controlled inputs without sanitization could pose injection risk if inputs are malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs connection strings from various sources, including user-supplied parameters and configuration. It uses standard libraries (pyodbc, SQLAlchemy) and patterns typical for database hooks. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The primary security concern is the potential for injection if untrusted inputs are supplied in connection parameters, but this is a common and documented pattern. The code does not perform any malicious actions or exfiltrate data. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and potential misconfiguration risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate implementation of an ODBC connection hook with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk score reflects the potential for configuration-based manipulation but does not indicate active malicious behavior. The scores are appropriate and justified.",
