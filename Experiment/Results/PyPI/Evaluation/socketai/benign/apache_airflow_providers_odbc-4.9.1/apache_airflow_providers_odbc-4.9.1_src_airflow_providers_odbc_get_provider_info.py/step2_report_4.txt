  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a static, auto-generated Python function returning package metadata.\n- No external inputs, dynamic code execution, network calls, or data processing are present.\n- URLs and dependencies are legitimate and well-known.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are identified.\n\n**Confirmations & Validations:**\n- The code matches the description: a simple function returning a static dictionary.\n- No issues are present in the code itself.\n- The reports' assessments of benign nature are consistent and accurate.\n\n**Scores & Justifications:**\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, static code.\n- **Security Risk Score:** All assign 0, justified by the lack of vulnerabilities or suspicious behaviors.\n\n**Potential Discrepancies & Recommendations:**\n- The scores seem reasonable and aligned with the analysis.\n- No modifications are necessary; the assessments are justified.\n\n**Final Expert Evaluation:**\n- The code is a benign, static metadata provider.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate and thorough. The code is safe, with no security concerns.",
