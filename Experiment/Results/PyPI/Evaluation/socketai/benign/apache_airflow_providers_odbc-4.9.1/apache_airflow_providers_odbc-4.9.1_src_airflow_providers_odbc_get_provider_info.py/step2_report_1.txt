  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the findings, scores, and underlying assumptions.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code in question is a simple Python function returning static package metadata.\n- All reports agree that the code is auto-generated, static, and contains no dynamic or suspicious operations.\n- No external inputs, network calls, or data processing occurs.\n- URLs and dependencies are legitimate and standard for package metadata.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code. It is benign and purely informational.\n- **Malware or malicious activity:** None detected. The code does not perform any actions that could be malicious.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed; the code is straightforward.\n- **Security risks:** None apparent; static data with no external interactions.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Risk score:** 0, since there's no security concern.\n\n### Justification:\n\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is static, auto-generated, and safe.\n- The high confidence (1) in each report is justified.\n- No changes are needed to the scores.\n\n---\n\n### Critical points:\n\n- **Potential assumptions:** Some reports mention \"no suspicious URLs or code constructs,\" which is accurate.\n- **Any overlooked risks?** Given the simplicity, unlikely. The code is purely static data.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Scores:** Keep all scores at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n- **Risk justification:** Zero risk is justified; no malicious or suspicious activity is detected.\n- **Estimate for overall scores:** Based on all reports, the overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at **0**.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, static, and safe. No modifications or concerns are necessary.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, with no security concerns or malicious intent.",
