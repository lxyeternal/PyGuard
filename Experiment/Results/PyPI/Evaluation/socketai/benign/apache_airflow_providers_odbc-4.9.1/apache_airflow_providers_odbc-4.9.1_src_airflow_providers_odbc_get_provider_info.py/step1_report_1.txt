{
  "purpose": "Provides metadata and configuration details for the 'apache-airflow-providers-odbc' Python package, including version info, dependencies, and integration data.",
  "sources": "Reads static data embedded within the function, including package info, version lists, URLs, and dependency lists.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output; no external system calls or data leakage points are evident.",
  "flows": "Static data is returned directly from the function without processing untrusted inputs; no data flows from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code is auto-generated, contains only static data, and does not perform any dynamic or suspicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple Python function returning a static dictionary with package metadata. No external input, user input, or environment variable usage is present. There are no dynamic code evaluations, no network operations, and no handling of untrusted data. The content appears to be a standard generated metadata file for a package, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. All dependencies and URLs are related to official or well-known sources. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, auto-generated metadata provider for a Python package. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, and no security risks. It is safe and typical for package configuration files.",
