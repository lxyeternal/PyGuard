{
  "purpose": "Provides metadata and configuration details for the 'apache-airflow-providers-odbc' package, including version info, dependencies, and integration details.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from static dictionaries and lists defining package metadata, dependencies, and configurations.",
  "sinks": "The data is returned as a dictionary; no sinks that process untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from static definitions within the function to the returned dictionary object; no external input flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious URLs, or unusual code constructs are present. The code is auto-generated and purely informational.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single function returning a static dictionary with package info, version lists, dependencies, and metadata. There are no external data inputs, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated parts. The URLs are legitimate documentation links, and the dependencies are standard for a Python package. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, auto-generated metadata provider for a Python package with no malicious or suspicious elements. It is safe and serves purely informational purposes.",
