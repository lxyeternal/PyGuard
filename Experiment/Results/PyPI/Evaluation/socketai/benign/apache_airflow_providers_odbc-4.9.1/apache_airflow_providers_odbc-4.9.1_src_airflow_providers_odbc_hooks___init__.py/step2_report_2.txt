  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n1. **Report 1**:\n   - **Claim**: The code is a benign license header comment with no executable code, data flow, or malicious behavior.\n   - **Assessment**: The analysis is accurate. The code is a standard license comment, with no signs of obfuscation, malware, or security risks.\n   - **Scores**:\n     - Malware: 0 (correct)\n     - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n     - Security Risk: 0 (correct)\n   - **Conclusion**: Scores are appropriate.\n\n2. **Report 2**:\n   - **Claim**: Same as above—benign license header, no executable code or malicious intent.\n   - **Assessment**: Accurate. No issues detected.\n   - **Scores**:\n     - Malware: 0 (correct)\n     - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n     - Security Risk: 0 (correct)\n   - **Conclusion**: Scores are appropriate.\n\n3. **Report 3**:\n   - **Claim**: Again, a standard license header with no suspicious elements.\n   - **Assessment**: Correct. No executable code or anomalies.\n   - **Scores**:\n     - Malware: 0 (correct)\n     - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n     - Security Risk: 0 (correct)\n   - **Conclusion**: Appropriate scores.\n\n4. **Report 4**:\n   - **Claim**: License header, no executable code or data handling.\n   - **Assessment**: Accurate. No malicious or suspicious behavior.\n   - **Scores**:\n     - Malware: 0 (correct)\n     - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n     - Security Risk: 0 (correct)\n   - **Conclusion**: Scores are suitable.\n\n5. **Report 5**:\n   - **Claim**: Standard license header comment.\n   - **Assessment**: Correct. No issues.\n   - **Scores**:\n     - Malware: 0 (correct)\n     - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n     - Security Risk: 0 (correct)\n   - **Conclusion**: Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports correctly identify that the code is a license header comment with no executable code, data flow, or malicious behavior. The scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, security risk all at 0) are consistent and reasonable.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate and well-justified.** There is no need to adjust the scores. The code is benign boilerplate license text.",
