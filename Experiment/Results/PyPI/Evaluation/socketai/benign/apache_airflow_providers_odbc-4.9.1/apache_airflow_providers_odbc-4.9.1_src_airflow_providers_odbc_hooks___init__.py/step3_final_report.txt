  "flows": "No data flows; only static comments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code consists solely of licensing comments with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely a license header comment, containing no executable statements, data input/output, or data flows. It does not include any obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors. The code's structure is standard boilerplate licensing information, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the content. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected, and the code does not pose any security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign license header comment with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-related issues. The reports correctly identify its nature, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
