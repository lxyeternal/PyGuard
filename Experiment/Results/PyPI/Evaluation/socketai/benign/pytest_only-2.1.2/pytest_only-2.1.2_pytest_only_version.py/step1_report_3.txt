{
  "purpose": "Retrieve the version number of the 'pytest-only' package if installed, otherwise set version to 'dev'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the installed package information using pkg_resources.get_distribution('pytest-only').version.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or actions that could lead to data leakage or execution of untrusted code based on input.",
  "flows": "The source (package version info) is assigned to a variable, with no further processing or transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present. The code simply checks for package installation and retrieves version info.",
  "analysis": "The code uses a standard approach to determine if a specific package ('pytest-only') is installed by querying the distribution info via pkg_resources. If the package is present, it stores its version; if not, it defaults to 'dev'. This pattern is common for setup or version checks. No malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or obfuscation is evident. The logic is straightforward and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, designed to obtain package version info, and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
