  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code.\n\n**Code Recap:**\n```python\nimport pkg_resources\n\ntry:\n    __version__ = pkg_resources.get_distribution('pytest-only').version\nexcept pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound:\n    __version__ = 'dev'\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the presence of issues:\n- The code's logic is straightforward: it imports `pkg_resources`, attempts to retrieve the installed version of `'pytest-only'`, and defaults to `'dev'` if not found.\n- No suspicious or malicious code, such as dynamic execution, network calls, or obfuscated patterns, is present.\n- The exception handling is standard and appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**No issues are present in the code.** The reports correctly identify this as a benign version check.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n#### Reports 1-5:\n- **Purpose & Sources:** All correctly describe the goal: retrieve the package version or fallback.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** They note that the data flows are internal and do not lead to external or malicious actions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** All reports agree that the code is standard, with no anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** All conclude benign behavior with high confidence (1).\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAll five reports are consistent, accurate, and correctly interpret the code as harmless.\n\n---\n\n### Scores and Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 for all reports. The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present.\n- **Security Risk:** 0, as the code performs a benign package version check with proper exception handling.\n\n**Are the scores reasonable?**  \nYes. They align with the code's actual behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores:**  \n  Given the analysis, I would assign:\n\n  - **Malware:** 0  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0  \n  - **Security Risk:** 0\n\n- **Additional considerations:**  \n  The code is standard and does not pose any security threat.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type           | Recommended Score |\n|----------------------|-------------------|\n| Malware              | 0                 |\n| Obfuscated           | 0                 |\n| Security Risk        | 0                 |\n\n**All reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nThe initial assessments are correct; the code is benign, and the scores reflect that.",
