  "purpose": "Retrieve the version number of the 'pytest-only' package if installed, otherwise set version to 'dev'.",
  "sources": "The call to pkg_resources.get_distribution('pytest-only').version reads package metadata.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data into critical operations or external effects.",
  "flows": "From the package metadata read to setting the __version__ variable; no external data flows or user input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code simply attempts to read package info and handles the exception gracefully.",
  "analysis": "The code uses pkg_resources to get the version of a specific package, 'pytest-only'. It employs a try-except block to handle the case where the package is not installed, defaulting to 'dev'. This is a standard method for retrieving package version information and does not involve any suspicious or malicious behavior. No external network connections, code injections, or obfuscated code are present. The logic is straightforward and typical for version detection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a simple package version check with proper exception handling. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
