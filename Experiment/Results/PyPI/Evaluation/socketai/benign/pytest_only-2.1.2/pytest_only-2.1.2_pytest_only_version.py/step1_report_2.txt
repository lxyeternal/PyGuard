  "purpose": "Retrieve the version number of the 'pytest-only' package if installed, otherwise set version to 'dev'.",
  "sources": "pkg_resources.get_distribution('pytest-only').version",
  "sinks": "Assignment to __version__ variable; no external data sinks or network operations.",
  "flows": "Source (get_distribution) -> sink (__version__ assignment).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard package version retrieval with exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pkg_resources and attempts to obtain the installed version of the 'pytest-only' package. If the package is not found, it assigns 'dev' to __version__. The logic is straightforward and uses standard library functions. No obfuscated code, malicious data handling, or suspicious behavior is present. It performs a common task of retrieving package metadata with exception handling for missing packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign operation to get the package version with proper error handling. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
