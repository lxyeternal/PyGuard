{
  "purpose": "Retrieve the installed version of the 'pytest-only' package or default to 'dev' if not installed.",
  "sources": "pkg_resources.get_distribution('pytest-only').version",
  "sinks": "Assignment to __version__, no external data leaks or effects",
  "flows": "Source (package metadata) to variable __version__",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward version retrieval with exception handling",
  "analysis": "The code imports pkg_resources and attempts to get the version of 'pytest-only'. If the package is not found, it assigns 'dev' to __version__. The logic is simple, uses standard library functions, and contains no malicious or suspicious patterns. No obfuscation, data leaks, or network activity are present. The exception handling is appropriate, and the code's behavior is benign. All reports correctly interpret this as a benign version check, with no security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe pattern for package version detection. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, which are consistent with the code's behavior.",
