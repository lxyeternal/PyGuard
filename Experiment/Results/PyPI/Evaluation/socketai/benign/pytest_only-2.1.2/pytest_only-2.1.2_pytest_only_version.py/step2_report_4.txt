  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Code Review Summary:**\n- The code simply imports `pkg_resources` and attempts to retrieve the version of `'pytest-only'`.\n- If the package isn't installed, it assigns `'dev'` to `__version__`.\n- No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution occurs.\n- The logic is straightforward, with standard exception handling.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Evaluation of Each Report:\n\n#### Reports 1-5:\n- **Purpose & Sources:** All accurately describe the code's intent—retrieving package version or defaulting to `'dev'`.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly note that data flows are limited to variable assignment with no external effects or data leaks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** All find no anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious behavior, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** All conclude benign behavior with high confidence (1), which is appropriate.\n\n**Scores for all five reports:**\n- **obfuscated:** 0 (correct)\n- **malware:** 0 (correct, no malicious activity detected)\n- **securityRisk:** 0 (correct, no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### Potential Issues or Discrepancies:\n- **Malware Score:** Consistently 0 across all reports, which is accurate given the code.\n- **Risk Score:** All are 0, which is appropriate since the code performs a benign version check.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a standard pattern for package version retrieval with exception handling.\n- No malicious or suspicious activity is present.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious intent or activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** This is a straightforward, standard package version check with no security concerns.",
