  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, scores, and overall security implications.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: a straightforward attempt to get the version of 'pytest-only' using `pkg_resources.get_distribution`, with a fallback to `'dev'`.\n- The code is simple, uses standard library functions, and employs typical exception handling.\n- There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or data leaks.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Evaluations:\n\n**1. Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious logic, backdoors, or vulnerabilities.\n- It is a benign version check pattern.\n\n**2. Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n- The reports are accurate; they correctly interpret the code as a standard package version retrieval.\n- No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n- The reasoning that the code is safe and straightforward is sound.\n\n**3. Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware: 0` — correct, no malicious activity.\n  - `obfuscated: 0` — correct, code is clear.\n  - `securityRisk: 0` — appropriate, no security issues.\n- The confidence scores are 1, which is reasonable given the clarity and simplicity.\n- No adjustments needed here.\n\n**4. Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n- Since the code is benign, no justification for higher risk scores exists.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n\n**5. Malware Score:**\n- Correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n- No malicious behavior detected or implied.\n\n**6. Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n- All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code is a typical package version check, with no malicious or suspicious activity.\n- The reports are accurate and well-justified.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious intent or activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk detected)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code snippet. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
