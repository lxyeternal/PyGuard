{
  "purpose": "The code attempts to retrieve the installed version of the 'pytest-only' package, or sets it to 'dev' if the package is not found.",
  "sources": "The code reads the installed packages' metadata via 'pkg_resources.get_distribution'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted or user input; the code only accesses package metadata.",
  "flows": "The source (package metadata access) does not lead to any data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code performs a standard package version check with exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and attempts to get the version of 'pytest-only'. If the package is not installed, it assigns 'dev' to '__version__'. There are no suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The exception handling is standard and does not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscated code, unusual language features, or dynamic execution are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package version check with fallback; it does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
