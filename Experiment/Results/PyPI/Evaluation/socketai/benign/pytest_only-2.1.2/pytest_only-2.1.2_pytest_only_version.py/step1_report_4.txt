  "purpose": "Retrieve the version information of the 'pytest-only' package if installed; set to 'dev' if not found.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package distribution information using pkg_resources.get_distribution('pytest-only')",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data leakage or insecure operations detected.",
  "flows": "Attempt to get package version (source), fallback to setting version as 'dev' (sink) if package is not found.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present; the code simply retrieves package info.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pkg_resources to check for the installed version of 'pytest-only'. It uses a try-except block to handle the case where the package is not installed, setting __version__ accordingly. The code performs a common task with no signs of malicious activity or malicious code injection. It does not contain hardcoded credentials, network activity, or obfuscated constructs. The exception handling is standard, and there are no suspicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward package version retrieval with no malicious intent or security issues. It poses no security risk.",
