  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall code review:**\n\nThe code:\n```python\nimport pkg_resources\n\ntry:\n    __version__ = pkg_resources.get_distribution('pytest-only').version\nexcept pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound:\n    __version__ = 'dev'\n```\n\nThis is a standard pattern for checking whether a package is installed and retrieving its version, with a fallback. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data leaks. The code only reads package metadata and assigns a value to a variable, with proper exception handling.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n#### Reports 1–5:\n- **Purpose:** All describe the same core function—getting the version of `'pytest-only'` or defaulting to `'dev'`.\n- **Sources:** They all correctly identify the source as `pkg_resources.get_distribution('pytest-only').version`.\n- **Sinks:** No external data sinks, no network, no user input, just variable assignment.\n- **Flows:** Straightforward data flow from package metadata to variable.\n- **Anomalies:** None. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- **Analysis:** All reports correctly identify this as benign, standard package version retrieval code.\n- **Conclusion:** All agree the code is safe, with no security risks or malicious intent.\n- **Confidence:** 1 (high confidence).\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Malware:** 0.\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring considerations:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, correct since no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Are the scores reasonable?\n\nYes. The code is straightforward, and the reports correctly identify no malicious or risky behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Potential issues or inconsistencies:\n\n- The reports are all very similar and consistent; no discrepancies to challenge.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Justification:**\n\nThe code performs a common, well-understood task with standard exception handling, and no suspicious patterns are present. The uniformity across reports confirms that there are no overlooked issues.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- All reports are accurate and reasonable.\n- The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the scores at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk.",
