  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, the code behavior, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n- The code simply imports `pkg_resources` and attempts to get the version of `'pytest-only'`.\n- If the package is not installed, it assigns `'dev'` to `__version__`.\n- The logic is straightforward, standard, and does not involve any malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- No user input, network activity, obfuscation, or data leaks are involved.\n- The code is a common pattern for package version detection.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n#### Reports 1–5:\n- **Purpose & Sources:** All describe the same basic operation: retrieve package version or fallback to `'dev'`.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks, no external effects, just assignment.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected; standard exception handling.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** All agree that the code is benign, standard, and safe.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - `malware`: 0 — correct, no malicious activity detected.  \n  - `securityRisk`: 0 — no security issues.  \n  - `obfuscated`: 0 — code is clear and straightforward.  \n  - `confidence`: 1 — all reports are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes, the code behaves as described; no issues or malicious behavior are present.\n\n- **Are there any errors or flaws?**  \n  No. The reasoning is correct; the code is standard.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  The malware score of 0 is appropriate. The security risk is 0, obfuscated is 0, all consistent with the code.\n\n- **Potential risks or assumptions?**  \n  No. The reports correctly dismiss any security concern based on the code.\n\n- **Any inconsistencies?**  \n  No, all reports are aligned.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendation:\n\nGiven the analysis, **the scores assigned are appropriate and justified**. The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security concern.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a simple, safe package version check with proper exception handling. All reports correctly assess it as benign.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate. The scores are justified. No changes needed.",
