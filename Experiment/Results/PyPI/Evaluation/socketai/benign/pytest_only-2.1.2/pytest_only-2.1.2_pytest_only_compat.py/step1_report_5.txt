{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to provide compatibility functions for accessing pytest Node marker methods depending on the pytest version.",
  "sources": "The code reads the imported pytest module, checks attributes on Node objects, and accesses Node methods.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing modules, checking attributes on objects, and defining functions accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hard-coded secrets, or suspicious code are present. The use of conditional attribute checks is typical for compatibility layers.",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to import Node from pytest. It conditionally defines a function based on the presence of specific methods on the Node class. If neither method is present, it raises an error. All operations are limited to importing modules, checking attributes, and defining functions. No data is read from external sources, nor are there any inputs, network operations, or data leaks. The code is a straightforward compatibility shim for pytest versions and does not exhibit any malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign compatibility utility for pytest, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It only performs attribute checks and function definitions based on the pytest version. No suspicious or malicious code is detected.",
