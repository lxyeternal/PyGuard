{
  "purpose": "This code provides compatibility functions to access marker information from pytest Node objects, ensuring compatibility across different pytest versions.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'pytest' module version and attempts to import Node class from '_pytest.nodes' or '_pytest.main'. It also checks for attributes on the Node class to decide which method to use.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include any sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations. No data is written to external systems or files, nor are there network connections or system modifications.",
  "flows": "The flow involves checking available methods on the Node class and returning references to those methods; there are no complex data flows involving external inputs.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The code appears straightforward and standard for compatibility purposes.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally defines a function 'get_closest_marker' based on the presence of certain attributes on the Node class, which vary across pytest versions. It imports Node from different modules depending on availability, and raises an error if neither method is present. This approach ensures compatibility without executing any external commands or processing untrusted data. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code focuses solely on compatibility logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a compatibility utility for pytest, with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs safe attribute checks and imports, with no external data handling or network activity. Overall, it is a benign piece of code intended to support testing environments.",
