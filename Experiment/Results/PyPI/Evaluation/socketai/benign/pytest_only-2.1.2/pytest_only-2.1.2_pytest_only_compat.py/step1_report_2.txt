  "purpose": "The code provides compatibility functions for accessing pytest Node class methods across different pytest versions.",
  "sources": "Import statements for pytest and conditional attribute checks on Node class.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, and no dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports pytest and attempts to import Node from different pytest modules based on availability. It then defines a function get_closest_marker that adapts to different pytest versions by checking the presence of specific methods on the Node class. If neither method is available, it raises an error indicating version incompatibility. The code is focused on compatibility and does not perform any data processing, network operations, or file manipulations. It does not contain any malicious behavior or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a compatibility utility for pytest versions, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply adapts to different pytest API versions to ensure functionality. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are present.",
