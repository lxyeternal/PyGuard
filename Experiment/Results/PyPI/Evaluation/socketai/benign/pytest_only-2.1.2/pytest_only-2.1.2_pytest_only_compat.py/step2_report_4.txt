  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n**Code Review Summary:**\n- The code imports the pytest Node class from internal modules, depending on availability.\n- It then inspects whether the Node class has certain methods (`get_closest_marker` or `get_marker`) to define a compatibility function.\n- If neither method is available, it raises a RuntimeError.\n- The code is straightforward, with no data processing, network activity, or system modifications.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The purpose is to ensure compatibility across pytest versions.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  The code does not contain vulnerabilities, malware, or malicious behavior. It performs a simple compatibility check and function definition.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No logical errors or flaws are evident. The code handles missing methods gracefully and raises an error if neither is present.\n\n- **Scores review:**  \n  All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0 or very close to 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0. The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain malicious payloads.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n- **Risk Score:**  \n  The overall security risk is minimal; some reports assign a very low value (~0.1) for security risk, which is reasonable considering the code's compatibility purpose.\n\n- **Justification for higher scores:**  \n  Since the code is purely a compatibility shim with no malicious intent, higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \n  No. The code is standard, with no external inputs or data handling.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a benign compatibility utility.\n- No malicious or suspicious activity is evident.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### My personal estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (due to the potential for misconfiguration or misuse in a compromised environment, but generally very low)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, with no security risks or malware concerns. The existing scores are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports correctly identify the code as a benign compatibility layer with appropriate scoring. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are present.",
