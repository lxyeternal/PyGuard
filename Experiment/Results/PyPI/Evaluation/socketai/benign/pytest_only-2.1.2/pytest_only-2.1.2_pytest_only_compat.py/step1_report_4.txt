{
  "purpose": "The code provides compatibility functions for different versions of the pytest testing framework, specifically for retrieving test node markers.",
  "sources": "The code reads the pytest module version, attempts to import from internal pytest modules, and inspects attributes of the Node class.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs are present; the code does not process user input or external data directly.",
  "flows": "The code checks for the existence of specific methods in the Node class and defines functions to call these methods, based on availability.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses conditional attribute checking for compatibility, which is common. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to maintain compatibility across different pytest versions by inspecting available methods on the Node class. It imports necessary classes carefully, handles ImportError, and raises runtime errors if expected methods are missing. There are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. It functions solely to ensure compatibility and does not process or transmit sensitive data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility shim for pytest and does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears safe and straightforward, serving a common purpose in test suite setups.",
