  "purpose": "Compatibility layer for pytest Node class methods, ensuring support across different pytest versions.",
  "sources": "Imports internal pytest modules, inspects Node class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external data handling or network activity.",
  "flows": "Checks for method existence on Node, defines wrapper function, raises error if methods missing.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward attribute inspection and function definition, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports internal pytest modules, conditionally defines a wrapper for get_closest_marker based on method availability, and raises an error if neither method exists. It performs no data processing, network activity, or system modifications. The code is a simple compatibility utility with no malicious intent or security issues. Scores across reports consistently assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, and very low security risk, typically 0 or 0.1, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility shim for pytest, with no malicious or security concerns. The existing reports' scores are accurate and justified.",
