{
  "purpose": "This code provides compatibility functions for accessing pytest Node object markers, ensuring compatibility across different pytest versions.",
  "sources": "The code reads the pytest Node class from internal pytest modules and inspects the Node class's attributes.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing modules, checking attributes of Node, and defining a compatibility function based on available methods.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected. The code is straightforward and only handles compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to import the Node class from different pytest internal modules, then checks for the presence of certain methods to define a compatibility function. If neither method is available, it raises an error. The code does not perform any data processing, network activity, or system modifications. It relies on standard library functions and internal pytest structures, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility shim for pytest and contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It is a safe utility script for ensuring consistent access to Node marker methods across pytest versions.",
