  "purpose": "Static analysis tool to detect 'pytest.mark.only' decorators in Python test code, preventing focused tests from being overlooked.",
  "sources": "Decorator list of functions, class decorators, module-level assignments to 'pytestmark'",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions",
  "flows": "AST traversal from module/class/function definitions to decorator checks and assignment evaluations",
  "anomalies": "No malicious or suspicious code; the only minor point is an assertion that could be more robust but is not security-related",
  "analysis": "The code performs static AST traversal to identify 'pytest.mark.only' decorators and related assignments. It does not execute code, transmit data, or modify the environment. It accurately reports focused tests for test hygiene purposes. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or external data leaks are present. The scoring reflects this benign nature, with malware and risk scores at 0, and high confidence in the benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static analysis utility designed to flag 'pytest.mark.only' decorators. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The provided reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
