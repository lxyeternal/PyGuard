{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to analyze Python AST for the presence of pytest.mark.only decorators, likely to enforce or detect focused tests during test runs.",
  "sources": "The code reads decorator lists of functions, classes, and modules, as well as assignment statements related to 'pytestmark'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or external effects are present; the code primarily inspects AST nodes for specific patterns.",
  "flows": "Sources include decorators and assignment targets; flows lead to internal error collection for any 'pytest.mark.only' decorations detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code behavior such as data leaks, network access, or system modification detected. The code performs static AST analysis without executing or modifying runtime data.",
  "analysis": "The script uses AST parsing to detect 'pytest.mark.only' decorators in functions, classes, and modules. It defines helper functions to identify such decorators and processes the AST accordingly. No external data, network calls, or system modifications are present. The focus is solely on static code analysis for test marker annotations, with no evident malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static analysis tool for detecting focused tests marked with 'pytest.mark.only'. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign, specialized utility for code quality enforcement.",
