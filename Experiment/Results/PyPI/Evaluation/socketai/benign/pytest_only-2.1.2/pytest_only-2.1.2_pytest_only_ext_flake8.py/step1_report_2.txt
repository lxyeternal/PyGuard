{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to analyze Python AST to identify the presence of 'pytest.mark.only' decorators, which are used to focus or select specific tests during pytest execution.",
  "sources": "Input data is the AST of a Python module, specifically inspecting decorator lists, assignment statements, and class/function/module bodies for 'pytest.mark.only' marks.",
  "sinks": "The code only performs static analysis and does not include runtime data sinks or external data transmission points.",
  "flows": "The code traverses AST nodes (Module, ClassDef, FunctionDef, AsyncFunctionDef) to identify decorators and assignments related to 'pytest.mark.only' and logs errors when such decorators are found.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code detected. The code is focused solely on AST inspection related to testing markers.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'ast' module to parse Python code into an Abstract Syntax Tree and defines classes to visit nodes for the purpose of detecting 'pytest.mark.only' decorators. It includes utility functions to identify such decorators, check for specific assignment patterns, and report errors. There are no signs of malicious code or malicious data handling; the code performs static checks for specific test marking decorators. It strictly analyzes code structure without executing or transmitting data externally.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign static analysis tool intended to detect the use of 'pytest.mark.only' decorators. It contains no malicious behavior, no external data handling, and no obfuscated or malicious code. The purpose appears to be quality control or code hygiene enforcement within test suites.",
