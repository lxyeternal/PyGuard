{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to analyze Python AST for the presence of 'pytest.mark.only' decorators, likely for test code review or enforcement of testing standards.",
  "sources": "Reads AST nodes from the parsed Python source code, specifically decorator lists, function definitions, class definitions, module body, and assignment statements related to 'pytestmark'.",
  "sinks": "Adds error messages to internal list when 'pytest.mark.only' decorators are detected, but does not perform any data output or external actions.",
  "flows": "Traversal of AST nodes from module, class, function, and decorator levels to identify 'pytest.mark.only' decorators; reports findings via add_error.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a static code analysis tool focused on identifying specific decorator patterns; no suspicious or malicious behaviors are present. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are visible.",
  "analysis": "The script systematically traverses AST nodes to identify 'pytest.mark.only' decorators at module, class, and function levels. It uses helper functions to determine if an expression is a 'pytest.mark.only' mark. The code's purpose is to flag test code that uses focused tests, likely for code review or test hygiene enforcement. There are no network, file, or environment interactions. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident. It operates purely as a static analyzer, with no malicious or maliciously intended behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a static analysis utility to detect 'pytest.mark.only' decorators in Python test code. It does not contain any malicious behaviors, malware, or security risks. Its purpose is benign and purely for code review enforcement. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
