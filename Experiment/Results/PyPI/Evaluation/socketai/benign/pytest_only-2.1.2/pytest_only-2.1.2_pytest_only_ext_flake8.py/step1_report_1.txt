{
  "purpose": "This code defines an abstract syntax tree (AST) visitor for detecting 'pytest.mark.only' decorators in Python code, likely used as a test suite quality check or linting tool.",
  "sources": "Reads input code via AST parsing, specifically from decorator lists, assignment statements, and module/class/function bodies.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data flows into sensitive operations, such as network or file I/O.",
  "flows": "Analyzes decorators and assignment statements to identify 'pytest.mark.only' decorators, without forwarding data to external systems or performing side effects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code is straightforward, with clear purpose of identifying and reporting specific test decorators.",
  "analysis": "The code processes AST nodes to find 'pytest.mark.only' decorators, logging errors for such decorators to prevent their use. It employs visitor patterns to traverse functions, classes, and modules, checking for specific pytest marks. The logic is focused solely on static code analysis for test marking, with no data leaks, external calls, or obfuscated elements. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code's structure is clean, and it performs a specific linting function without side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign static analysis tool designed to flag specific decorators in Python test code. It does not contain any malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is purely used for code quality enforcement and does not perform any suspicious operations.",
