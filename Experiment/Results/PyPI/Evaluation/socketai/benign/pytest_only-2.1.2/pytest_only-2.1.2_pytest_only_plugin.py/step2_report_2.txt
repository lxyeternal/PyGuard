  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the correctness, potential security issues, malware, obfuscation, and consistency of scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard pytest plugin that adds options and filters tests based on an 'only' marker. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling is detected.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.95 (as per report), but the report states no malicious intent.\n- **Assessment:** The high securityRisk score (0.95) seems unjustified given the analysis. The code is benign, and no vulnerabilities or malicious activity are identified.\n- **Recommendation:** Reduce securityRisk to 0.1 or 0, aligning with the report's conclusion.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, straightforward pytest plugin for test filtering with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 1.\n- **Assessment:** The securityRisk score of 1 is too high; no vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are evident.\n- **Recommendation:** Lower securityRisk to 0.1 or 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard pytest extension with no signs of malicious activity. The report notes a securityRisk of 0.1, which seems acceptable.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.1.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, no malicious behavior. The only minor concern is the default '--only' set to True, which might restrict testing unintentionally.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.1.\n- **Assessment:** The securityRisk score is appropriate, given the limited impact.\n- **Note:** The default True setting could be a usability concern but not a security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** The report notes that '--only' defaults to True, which could restrict test runs unintentionally. No malicious code is present.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.1.\n- **Assessment:** The securityRisk score is justified; no malware or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis**\n\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security Risk:** Some reports assign high scores (0.95, 1) despite the code being benign. The code only filters tests based on markers, with no data leaks, external network activity, or malicious code.\n\n### **Final Recommendations**\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should be 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should be 0 across all reports.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Given the benign nature, should be around 0.1 at most, mainly due to the default '--only' being True, which could unintentionally restrict tests but isn't a security vulnerability.\n\n### **Summary**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Security Risk | Comments |\n|---------|---------|--------------|----------------|----------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0.1            | Reduce from 0.95 to 0.1 |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0.1            | Reduce from 1 to 0.1 |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0.1            | Correct as is |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0.1            | Correct as is |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0.1            | Correct as is |\n\n**Final note:** The code is safe, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The high securityRisk scores in some reports are overestimations; they should be lowered to reflect the benign nature of the code.",
