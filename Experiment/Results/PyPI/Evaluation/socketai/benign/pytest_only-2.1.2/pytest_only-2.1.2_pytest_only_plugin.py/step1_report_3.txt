{
  "purpose": "This code customizes pytest test collection and configuration by adding command-line options and marker filtering for test execution.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (--only, --no-only), and accesses pytest configuration and test items for marker filtering.",
  "sinks": "Modifies the list of test items to run based on the 'only' marker, affecting test execution flow.",
  "flows": "Command-line options influence the test selection; test items are filtered based on presence of 'only' marker; filtered list affects which tests are run.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated features observed. The marker filtering is standard pytest behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script extends pytest functionality by adding options '--only' and '--no-only', controlling whether only marked tests are executed. The marker 'only' is used to select specific tests for execution. The code modifies the 'items' list directly based on the marker presence, which is typical in pytest plugins. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling present. The code operates solely within the pytest testing framework, with no external network or system access.\n\nOverall, the code performs standard test filtering with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward pytest plugin extension for filtering tests based on markers. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It operates within expected pytest practices.",
