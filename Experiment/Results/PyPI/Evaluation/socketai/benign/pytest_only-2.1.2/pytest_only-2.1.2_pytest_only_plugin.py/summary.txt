  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pytest plugin for filtering tests based on markers, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The high security risk scores in some reports are unjustified and should be adjusted downward. Overall, the code is safe, benign, and well within acceptable security parameters."
