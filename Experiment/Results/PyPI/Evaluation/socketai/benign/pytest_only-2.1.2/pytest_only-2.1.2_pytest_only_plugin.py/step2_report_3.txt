  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** The report states the code is a standard pytest plugin for filtering tests based on an 'only' marker, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.95.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code is straightforward, and no malicious behavior is detected. The security risk is correctly scored as zero. The high confidence score aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, confirming standard pytest plugin behavior, no malicious code or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent and thorough. The scores are appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues; scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Again, the code is standard pytest extension, with no malicious activity. The only note is that the default '--only' is set to True, which might be unconventional but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** The slight security risk score (0.1) is justified due to the default enabling of '--only', which could unintentionally restrict test runs. No malware or obfuscation is present.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to previous, standard pytest plugin, no malicious code. The analysis emphasizes that the code is safe and typical.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent, and the scores reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Conclusion:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** The report notes that '--only' defaults to True, which might restrict test runs unintentionally, but no malicious behavior. The overall assessment is that the code is standard and safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The concern about the default value of '--only' is valid but does not constitute a security risk or malicious behavior. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final thoughts:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slightly higher (0.1) in some reports due to the default '--only' being True, which could lead to unintentionally limited test runs, but not a security threat.\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — the default setting of '--only' to True could cause operational issues but is not a security risk.\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, standard pytest plugin code with a minor quirk regarding default behavior. The scores in the reports are reasonable and justified.**",
