{
  "purpose": "This code customizes the behavior of pytest test runner by adding options and configuring test selection based on markers.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line options (--only, --no-only), pytest configuration, and test item markers.",
  "sinks": "Potentially modifies the test collection based on user options and markers, affecting which tests are executed or deselected.",
  "flows": "Command-line options influence the conditional selection of tests marked with 'only', altering the test suite execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious dynamic code, or obfuscated logic present. The code performs standard pytest plugin customization without unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to add command-line options (--only, --no-only) and to configure pytest markers. It then modifies the test collection based on the presence of the 'only' marker, filtering tests accordingly. The logic is straightforward, using pytest hooks and marker checks, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a typical pytest plugin feature to run only marked tests when specified. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code appears safe and benign.",
