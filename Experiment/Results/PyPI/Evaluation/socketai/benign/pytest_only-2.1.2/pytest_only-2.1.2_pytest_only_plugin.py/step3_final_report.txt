{
  "purpose": "This code customizes pytest options '--only' and '--no-only' to filter test execution based on the 'only' marker, enabling selective test runs.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from command-line options '--only' and '--no-only', and accesses test items via 'items' parameter in 'pytest_collection_modifyitems'.",
  "sinks": "The code modifies the 'items' list in-place to filter tests; no external data sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input from command-line options influences the filtering logic in 'pytest_collection_modifyitems', which then alters the 'items' list based on the presence of the 'only' marker.",
  "anomalies": "The default value for '--only' is set to True, which may be unconventional and could unintentionally restrict test runs; no malicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward pytest plugin that adds options for test filtering based on markers. It uses standard pytest hooks and marker detection. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The high security risk scores assigned in some reports (e.g., 0.95, 1) are overestimations given the benign nature of the code. The malware score is correctly zero; obfuscation is absent. The risk score should be lowered to approximately 0.1 to reflect the minimal operational impact and lack of security concerns. The code's design does not involve data leaks, network activity, or malicious actions. The only minor concern is the default '--only' being True, which could restrict test coverage unintentionally but does not constitute a security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pytest plugin for filtering tests based on markers, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The high security risk scores in some reports are unjustified and should be adjusted downward. Overall, the code is safe, benign, and well within acceptable security parameters.",
