{
  "purpose": "The code customizes pytest test collection and filtering behavior based on a custom 'only' marker.",
  "sources": "Input sources are command-line options '--only' and '--no-only', as well as pytest configuration and collection hooks.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include modifications to the 'items' list during test collection, which can influence test execution flow.",
  "flows": "Command-line options influence whether only tests marked with 'only' are run; the collection hook filters tests accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic. The code only modifies test selection based on markers and options.",
  "analysis": "The code defines pytest hooks to add command-line options '--only' and '--no-only' and to filter collected tests to only run those marked with 'only'. The logic involves standard pytest extension practices, with no obfuscated or malicious code detected. It uses 'get_closest_marker' to identify 'only' markers and modifies the 'items' list accordingly. No data leaks, external network activity, or malicious behavior is present. The code's structure is clear, and no unusual or suspicious behavior is observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard pytest plugin extension that filters test runs based on a custom marker. There are no signs of malicious activity, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate testing utility.",
