{
  "purpose": "Enhance pytest testing framework with options to run only marked tests",
  "sources": "Input options '--only' and '--no-only' from command line; marker definitions in pytest configuration",
  "sinks": "Modification of 'items' list during collection; potential control over which tests are executed",
  "flows": "Command line input -> pytest options -> conditional logic in 'pytest_collection_modifyitems' -> modifies 'items' list to filter tests",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'get_closest_marker' to identify 'only' markers; no hardcoded secrets or unusual code structures; standard pytest plugin pattern",
  "analysis": "The code defines pytest hooks to add command-line options '--only' and '--no-only' to control test selection. It registers a marker 'only' that filters tests during collection, executing only marked tests if '--only' is enabled. The logic is straightforward and uses standard pytest plugin conventions. No obfuscated or suspicious behavior, no code injection, data leakage, or malicious actions are present. The control flow is limited to test filtering and configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a simple test filtering mechanism for pytest, allowing selective test execution based on markers. There is no malicious or suspicious activity detected; the code aligns with standard testing plugin practices.",
