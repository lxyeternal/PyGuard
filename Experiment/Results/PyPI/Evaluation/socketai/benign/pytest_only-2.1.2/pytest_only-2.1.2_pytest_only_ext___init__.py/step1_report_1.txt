{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple utility module, potentially for data processing or configuration management, with no clear malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input data may be read from environment variables, function parameters, or external files (if any are used). Specific source points are not explicitly shown due to the lack of code content.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include print statements, network connections, file writes, or system commands if present; however, none are explicitly evident in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources such as environment variables or parameters to processing functions and possibly to output or storage mechanisms, but specific flows cannot be confirmed without detailed code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious function calls, or unusual code constructs are visible. The code structure appears straightforward and typical.",
  "analysis": "The provided code snippet is either empty or lacks substantive content, making detailed analysis challenging. Based on the minimal content, no signs of obfuscated or malicious code are evident. The absence of complex logic, hidden functions, or suspicious patterns suggests this code is benign. Without further details, the confidence level remains low, but no immediate threats are detectable.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks based on the current snippet. It is likely a harmless utility or placeholder code, but additional context could provide more definitive insights.",
