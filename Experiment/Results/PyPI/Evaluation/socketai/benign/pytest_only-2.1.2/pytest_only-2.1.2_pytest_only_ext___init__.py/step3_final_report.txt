  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user inputs, external files, network sources, dynamic code execution (eval/exec).",
  "sinks": "System commands, network connections, data storage, untrusted data flows into system or network.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user inputs flow into eval/exec or network connections, potentially leading to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec, obfuscated variable names, suspicious URLs, hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code in Report 3 exhibits patterns indicative of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which pose security concerns. Other reports lack substantive code, showing minimal or benign patterns. The suspicious patterns in Report 3 justify a moderate security risk and malware score, while the absence of malicious payloads in other reports supports low scores. The scores are consistent with the described patterns and confidence levels, with Report 3 warranting slightly higher suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low malware and obfuscation scores, except Report 3 which shows suspicious patterns like eval/exec and obfuscation. The overall security risk is moderate for Report 3 and low for others. Scores are adjusted to reflect these observations.",
