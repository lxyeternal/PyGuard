{
  "purpose": "This source code appears to be a typical Python module, possibly designed for data processing or utility functions, with no explicit indication of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from variables, possibly from function arguments or environment variables, but no specific input sources like files, network, or user input are clearly evident.",
  "sinks": "Data is processed within functions and potentially written to files or output streams, but no explicit sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system modifications are clearly present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (variables/environment) through functions, with no evident untrusted data reaching sensitive sinks or performing risky operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated parts, or unusual constructs. No backdoors or hidden behavior are evident. No dynamic code execution or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is standard Python with clear, understandable logic. There are no signs of malicious payloads, such as data exfiltration, system modification, or malicious network activity. Usage of third-party libraries appears normal, and no suspicious code paths are detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears safe and non-malicious. Confidence in this assessment is high, given the straightforward nature of the code.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
