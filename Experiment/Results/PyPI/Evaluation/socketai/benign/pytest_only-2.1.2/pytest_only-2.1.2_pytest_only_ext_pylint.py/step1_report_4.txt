{
  "purpose": "This code defines a static analysis checker for pylint to identify and warn about the presence of pytest.mark.only decorators in Python test code.",
  "sources": "The code reads decorator nodes, function definitions, class definitions, and module-level local variables to identify pytest.mark.only usage.",
  "sinks": "The code does not directly write to external systems, perform network operations, or execute untrusted data; it only adds warning messages within the pylint framework.",
  "flows": "Source nodes (decorators, function/class/module locals) are analyzed, and when a match for pytest.mark.only is found, a warning message is generated.",
  "anomalies": "There are no obvious anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code behaviors; the logic is straightforward for static code analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically checks for 'pytest.mark.only' decorators on functions, classes, and module-level pytest marks. It inspects decorators and local variables for the presence of specific attribute patterns indicating 'pytest.mark.only'. It then registers a custom pylint checker that emits warnings when such decorators or marks are detected, aiming to prevent test focus or selective test execution. No malicious or suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The code relies on standard AST node inspection methods and does not include external or network operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static analysis plugin designed to warn developers about the use of 'pytest.mark.only' in tests. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
