{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom pylint checker to identify and warn about the use of pytest.mark.only decorators in test files.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function definitions, class definitions, and module-level locals, specifically inspecting decorators and local variables such as 'pytestmark'.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks in this code where untrusted data is used for dangerous actions or data leaks.",
  "flows": "The code inspects decorators and local variables to identify usage of pytest.mark.only, then adds warning messages. No data flows into external systems or executes malicious commands.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be purely analytical, with no signs of malicious payloads, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior. It does not perform any dangerous operations or include hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a static analysis tool to detect pytest.mark.only annotations in test functions, classes, and modules. It inspects decorator nodes and local variables, specifically 'pytestmark'. It issues warnings when such markers are found. The code only uses standard AST analysis patterns and does not include any network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign static analysis script designed for code quality enforcement. It does not contain malware or security risks. The code simply inspects code structure to warn about specific test annotations, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
