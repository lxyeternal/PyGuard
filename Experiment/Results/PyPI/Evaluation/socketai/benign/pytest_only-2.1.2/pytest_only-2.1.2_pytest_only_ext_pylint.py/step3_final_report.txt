  "purpose": "A static analysis plugin for pylint that detects the use of pytest.mark.only decorators or markers in test code to warn developers about focused tests.",
  "sources": "Decorators on functions and classes, and the pytestmark variable in modules and classes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling; the code issues warnings via pylint messages based on code structure inspection.",
  "flows": "Inspection of decorators and pytestmark variables leading to message generation; no data flow outside static analysis.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; straightforward AST inspection.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard static analysis plugin that inspects function, class, and module definitions for pytest.mark.only usage. It uses AST nodes to identify decorators and pytestmark assignments, then issues warnings if such focused markers are found. The logic is clear, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external system interaction. The scores assigned in all reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign, purely analytical purpose of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static analysis plugin designed to promote testing best practices by warning about focused tests marked with pytest.mark.only. It does not pose any malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly reflect this, with appropriate scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk. No modifications are necessary.",
