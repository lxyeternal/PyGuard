{
  "purpose": "This code defines a custom pylint checker to identify and flag the use of pytest.mark.only in test code, which is used to focus on specific tests during development.",
  "sources": "The code reads function, class, and module nodes, as well as decorators and local variables like 'pytestmark'.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data is processed, stored, or transmitted; the code only inspects test definitions and decorators.",
  "flows": "The code flows from source nodes (decorators, function/class definitions, module locals) through helper functions that identify 'pytest.mark.only' usage, to the checker methods that report findings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code logic solely inspects test metadata to produce warnings.",
  "analysis": "The code imports relevant modules for AST analysis and defines functions to detect 'pytest.mark.only' decorations. The core class 'PytestOnlyMarkChecker' checks function definitions, class definitions, and modules for this marker and issues warnings when found. The check is straightforward and limited to test code inspection. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are evident; the code serves as a static code quality tool.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign static analysis tool designed to identify and warn about focused tests using 'pytest.mark.only'. It does not contain malicious behavior, malicious data handling, or security risks. The code is well-structured for its purpose.",
