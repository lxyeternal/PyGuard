{
  "purpose": "This code is a static analysis plugin for pylint that detects the use of pytest.mark.only decorators to identify and warn about focused tests in Python test suites.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function and class definitions, their decorators, and 'pytestmark' variables within modules and classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in the code; it does not process untrusted data for execution, storage, or transmission.",
  "flows": "The code flows from reading decorators and 'pytestmark' assignments (sources) to adding warning messages (outputs) when specific decorators are found.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns are present. The code uses standard static analysis techniques.",
  "analysis": "The code is a pylint plugin that defines a checker class to detect usage of pytest.mark.only. It inspects function, class, and module definitions for decorators or variables indicating focused tests. The implementation uses standard static analysis approaches without executing code or handling untrusted input. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code's structure and operations are typical of a code quality or style enforcement plugin.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign pylint plugin designed to enforce testing best practices by warning about focused tests. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It operates solely as a static analysis tool with no impact on runtime behavior or data security.",
