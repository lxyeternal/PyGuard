{
  "purpose": "This code defines a static analysis checker for pylint to detect the presence of pytest.mark.only decorators in test code, which are used to focus or run specific tests exclusively.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function and class decorators, as well as module-level variables such as 'pytestmark'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not appear to write or send data anywhere, nor does it execute untrusted input or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Input data from decorators and class/module variables flows into functions that identify 'pytest.mark.only' decorators, leading to the addition of warning messages if such decorators are found.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious or unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements. The code strictly performs static analysis and message reporting without executing external commands or network activities.",
  "analysis": "The script defines functions to identify 'pytest.mark.only' decorators in Python test code. It inspects function, class, and module nodes for these decorators or 'pytestmark' assignments. The 'PytestOnlyMarkChecker' class uses these functions to scan code nodes and adds warnings when 'pytest.mark.only' is detected. The purpose is to enforce testing best practices by discouraging focused tests. No malicious or maliciously intended code is present; it is a standard static analysis checker. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or code injection. The code operates entirely within the static analysis context, analyzing code structure without executing or transmitting data.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a static analysis tool designed to detect the use of pytest.mark.only decorators in test code. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It performs a benign, targeted inspection for a specific pattern to promote testing discipline.",
