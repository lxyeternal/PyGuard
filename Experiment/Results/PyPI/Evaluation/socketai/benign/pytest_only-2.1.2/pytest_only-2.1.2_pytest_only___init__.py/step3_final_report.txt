{
  "purpose": "The code imports local modules 'plugin' and '__version__' from the current package, serving as part of package initialization or version management.",
  "sources": "Import statements accessing local modules within the package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not handle user input, network data, or external data streams.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code merely imports modules without processing data.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of dynamic code execution, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns; the code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of straightforward import statements from local modules, typical for package setup. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The minimal nature and lack of data handling or network activity indicate a benign purpose. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module import segment with no malicious or security concerns. The provided assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
