{
  "purpose": "Importing a plugin module and version information, likely for module initialization or setup.",
  "sources": "Import statements for local module 'plugin' and version information from '.version'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output generation present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; simple import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; only module imports with relative paths.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for a local plugin module and version information. There are no functions, data processing, network calls, or code execution beyond imports. The relative imports suggest internal package structure, and no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are evident. The code appears standard for module setup or initialization.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving only to import local modules and version info without any malicious intent or security risks.",
