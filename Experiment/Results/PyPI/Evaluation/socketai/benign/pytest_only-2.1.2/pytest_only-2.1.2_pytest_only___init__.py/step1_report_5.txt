  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python package, importing a module named 'plugin' and a version string from 'version'.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'plugin' and '__version__' from 'version'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; these are static import statements.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports a local module and a version variable, which is typical for Python packages to expose metadata and modules. There are no dynamic executions, network operations, or suspicious patterns. The structure and content are consistent with standard package code.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the minimal code provided, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be standard package initialization or module import statements.",
