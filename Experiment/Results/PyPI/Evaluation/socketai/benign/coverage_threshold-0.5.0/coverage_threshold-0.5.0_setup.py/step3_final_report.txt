  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for a Python package named 'coverage_threshold', defining metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, package metadata, dependencies, and entry point declaration.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data or external inputs processed in a suspicious manner.",
  "flows": "Reading README content -> passing data to setup() -> defining package metadata and entry points.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and adheres to common packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with no embedded malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. It reads a README file, specifies package info, dependencies, and CLI entry points. No hardcoded secrets, network connections, or malicious payloads are present. The dependency 'toml >= 0.10.2' is trustworthy. The structure and content are standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The package setup script is benign, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The code is straightforward and aligns with best practices for Python packaging. The empty reports further support the conclusion that there are no security concerns.",
