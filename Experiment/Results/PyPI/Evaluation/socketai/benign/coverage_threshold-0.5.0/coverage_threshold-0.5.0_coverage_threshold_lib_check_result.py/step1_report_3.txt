{
  "purpose": "Define data structures and functions to represent and combine check results, indicating success or failure with optional problems list.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; the code defines static classes and functions operating on passed-in data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or external output; the code only manipulates data internally.",
  "flows": "Results from combine_check_results propagate through fold_check_results; no external data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code provides classes Pass and Fail to represent validation results, with a function to combine two results and a function to reduce multiple results into a single outcome. No input/output handling, network calls, or external dependencies are present. The logic is simple and does not contain any dynamic code execution or suspicious patterns. It appears to be utility code for internal validation processes, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, designed for internal result handling. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling mechanisms. It is a standard pattern for combining validation results.",
