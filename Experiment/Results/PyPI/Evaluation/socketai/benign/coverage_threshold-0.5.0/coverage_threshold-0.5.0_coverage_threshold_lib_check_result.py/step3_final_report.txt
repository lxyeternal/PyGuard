{
  "purpose": "Defines immutable classes Pass and Fail to represent check results, and functions to combine and fold these results for internal result aggregation.",
  "sources": "Internal data classes and functions; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling; purely internal logic.",
  "flows": "Results are combined within combine_check_results; fold_check_results reduces multiple results into one.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple, immutable data classes for pass/fail results and functions to merge these results. No external inputs, outputs, or dynamic code execution are present. The logic is correct, well-documented, and aligns with standard patterns for result aggregation. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the benign, utility-focused nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility module for managing check results. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The current scores are justified and accurate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
