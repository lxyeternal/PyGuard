  "purpose": "Define data structures and functions to represent and combine check results, indicating pass/fail status with optional problem descriptions.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write or transmit data or execute untrusted input.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs identified.",
  "analysis": "The code defines immutable data classes 'Pass' and 'Fail' to represent check results, with 'combine_check_results' merging two results based on their type, and 'fold_check_results' aggregating multiple results using reduce. The functions include docstring examples demonstrating expected behavior. There are no signs of obfuscated code, external data handling, or malicious logic. The code appears to be straightforward utility functions for result management without external interaction or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard utility implementation for managing check results. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies are detected. It appears safe and well-structured for its intended purpose.",
