{
  "purpose": "Define data structures and functions to combine and evaluate multiple check results, indicating pass/fail outcomes.",
  "sources": "Input data for check results (not explicitly from external sources); class definitions and function parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data output, network communication, or untrusted data handling evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from result objects through combination functions; no external data flow or processing observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. The code is straightforward and self-contained.",
  "analysis": "The code defines immutable data classes 'Pass' and 'Fail' to represent check outcomes, with a function to combine these results and a fold function to process multiple results. The use of standard Python features and clear docstrings suggests benign intent. No external input handling, network communication, or malicious behavior is evident. The logic focuses solely on internal data manipulation without side effects.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility for handling check results. There are no signs of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks. The implementation is straightforward, and no suspicious behaviors are detected.",
