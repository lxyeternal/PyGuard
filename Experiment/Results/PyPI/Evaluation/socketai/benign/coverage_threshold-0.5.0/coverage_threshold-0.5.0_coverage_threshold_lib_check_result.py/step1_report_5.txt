{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures and functions for combining and folding check results, representing success or failure states with optional problems.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external output handling present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no source-to-sink data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated constructs, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily establishes immutable data classes 'Pass' and 'Fail' to represent check outcomes, along with functions to combine and fold these results. The logic is straightforward, with no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no use of environment variables, network operations, or system calls. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs present. The functions operate purely on in-memory data structures, serving as utility functions for result aggregation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of result handling with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a benign utility module intended for internal logic of larger systems.",
