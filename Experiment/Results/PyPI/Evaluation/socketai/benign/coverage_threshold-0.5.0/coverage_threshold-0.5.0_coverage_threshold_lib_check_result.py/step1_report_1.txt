  "purpose": "Defines data structures and functions to combine and evaluate check results (Pass/Fail).",
  "sources": "No external input sources; only internal data processing.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or output to external systems.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; functions operate on passed-in data objects without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines immutable data classes Pass and Fail, and functions to combine and fold these results using reduce. The logic is straightforward for result aggregation. There are no external inputs, no network operations, and no side-effects. The code appears to be purely for internal logic management without any malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a utility for result management. No indicators of malicious intent, malware, or security risks are present.",
