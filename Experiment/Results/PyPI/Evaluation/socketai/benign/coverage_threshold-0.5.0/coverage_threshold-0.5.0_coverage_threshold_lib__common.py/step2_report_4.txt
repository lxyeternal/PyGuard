  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is straightforward, performing coverage calculations and threshold checks without malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behaviors, no obfuscation, no external untrusted data handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent with the analysis.\n- **Assessment:** Valid and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, the code is standard for coverage checks, with no suspicious patterns.\n- **Findings:** No external inputs or malicious logic.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is a typical coverage utility, with safe calculations and no malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No obfuscation, no external data leaks, no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n- **Assessment:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with a focus on standard calculations and checks.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity, minimal security risk (0.1), which might reflect inherent reliance on trusted data.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — reasonable.\n- **Assessment:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern; straightforward utility functions with no malicious indicators.\n- **Findings:** No obfuscation, no external data leaks, standard calculations.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n- **Assessment:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- **Code Presence:** The code is present and functions as described.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No evidence of malware or obfuscation across all reports.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low, as the code only performs internal calculations and threshold checks without external interactions.\n- **Scores Consistency:** All scores align well with the analysis.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\nGiven the consistent findings across all reports, I would assign:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — minimal security risk, as the code performs standard coverage checks.\n\n**Note:** The slight security risk score of 0.1 in one report likely accounts for the reliance on trusted data sources but does not indicate any real threat.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, well-structured utility for coverage metrics with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.",
