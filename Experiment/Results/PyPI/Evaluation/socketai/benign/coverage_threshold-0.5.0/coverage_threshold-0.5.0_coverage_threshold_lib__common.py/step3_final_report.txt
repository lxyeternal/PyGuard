  "purpose": "Utility functions for coverage metrics calculations and threshold checks, no malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Reads from trusted attributes of CoverageSummaryModel, no external inputs.",
  "sinks": "Uses internal data for calculations; no external data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from CoverageSummaryModel attributes through calculations to check functions.",
  "anomalies": "Typo in '_safe_percent' function parameter name ('denomenator' instead of 'denominator'), but does not affect functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward coverage calculations and comparison checks. It handles division by zero safely and performs simple, trusted data manipulations. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The typo in the parameter name is a minor spelling mistake but does not impact execution. The security risk and malware scores are correctly low (0), reflecting the benign nature of the code. The reports' assessments are consistent and accurate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe utility module for coverage metrics with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores are appropriate. Minor spelling correction recommended for clarity.",
