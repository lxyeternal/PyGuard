{
  "purpose": "This module appears to coordinate various file and total checks on a report object, likely for validation or analysis purposes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: report (ReportModel) and config (Config). Imports from internal modules (_file, _totals, check_result) and external modules (coverage_threshold.model).",
  "sinks": "Function calls: check_all_files, check_totals, and fold_check_results, which may process data and potentially produce outputs or effects based on report and config data.",
  "flows": "Input data (report, config) flows into check_all_files and check_totals, whose results are combined by fold_check_results, forming a unified CheckResult.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or suspicious data handling are evident. The code acts as a coordinator for checks and does not contain embedded malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific modules, defines a single function 'check_all' that calls two other functions with the report and config parameters, then aggregates their results. The pattern suggests a modular validation or analysis workflow. There are no signs of code injection, obfuscated code, or data leaks. The function operates as a simple orchestrator without any suspicious behavior or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward coordinator for report checks, with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It performs expected operations within a modular validation context.",
