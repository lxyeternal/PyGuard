{
  "purpose": "This module coordinates various checks on a report object using configuration settings, aggregating results from file checks and total checks.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules and functions for configuration, report handling, and check functions; no input or external data reading is explicitly shown.",
  "sinks": "The code invokes functions that process report data, but no direct sinks like network communication, file writing, or sensitive data exposure are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from report and config parameters into check functions, then results are aggregated via fold_check_results; no external untrusted input is processed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present; code appears straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific modules and functions, defines a function 'check_all' that takes report and config objects, and returns an aggregated check result. It calls 'check_all_files' and 'check_totals', then folds their results. There is no evidence of data leakage, malicious behavior, or suspicious activity. The code functions as a coordinator for checks, with no external data sources or sinks. No anomalies or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple orchestrator for performing multiple report checks and aggregating results. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security issues. Overall, it appears benign and safe.",
