  "purpose": "A minimal CLI entry point script that imports and executes a main function.",
  "sources": "The import of 'main' from 'coverage_threshold.cli' and the __main__ block calling sys.exit(main()).",
  "sinks": "The call to 'main()' which may process command-line arguments or perform actions, but not evident in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Execution flow from script start to calling 'main()' and exiting with its return code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, standard, and lacks obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python CLI bootstrap that imports 'main' and executes it if run directly. No data processing, network activity, or malicious code is present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature. The security and malware scores are appropriately zero, reflecting no malicious intent or obfuscation. The overall risk is negligible, assuming 'main()' is safe. No vulnerabilities or suspicious behaviors are detected in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard CLI entry point with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate and do not require adjustments. The overall security posture based on this snippet is safe.",
