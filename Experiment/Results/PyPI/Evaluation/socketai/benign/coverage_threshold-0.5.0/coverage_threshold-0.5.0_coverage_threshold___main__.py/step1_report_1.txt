{
  "purpose": "To invoke the main function of the coverage_threshold.cli module when executed as a script.",
  "sources": "The code reads the execution context to determine if it is run as a main program.",
  "sinks": "sys.exit() used to terminate the program, potentially passing the main function's return code.",
  "flows": "Execution begins at the if __name__ == '__main__' check, then calls main(), and exits with its return value.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing a main function from a CLI module, then executing it if run directly. It relies on the external main() implementation. No data is processed directly, and no suspicious patterns or obfuscated code are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward script launcher for a CLI tool, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues within this snippet.",
