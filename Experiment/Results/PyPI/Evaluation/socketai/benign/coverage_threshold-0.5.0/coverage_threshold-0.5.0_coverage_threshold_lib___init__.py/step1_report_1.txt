{
  "purpose": "This code module imports specific functions from internal submodules and defines the public API for the package via __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules: ._all_checks, ._file, ._totals",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks; no untrusted data handling or output operations present",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks, as this code only imports functions and sets __all__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears to be straightforward module setup with no suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports three functions from internal modules, likely part of a package's internal structure. The __all__ list indicates the public API. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no external data handling are present. The code structure is standard for Python packages, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python module setup for exporting functions, with no malicious behavior or security concerns identified. It appears safe and typical for package initialization.",
