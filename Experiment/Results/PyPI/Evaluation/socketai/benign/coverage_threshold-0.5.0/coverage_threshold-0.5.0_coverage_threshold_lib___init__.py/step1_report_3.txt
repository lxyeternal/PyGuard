{
  "purpose": "The code defines the public interface of a Python module by importing specific functions from internal modules and setting the __all__ attribute to specify exported symbols.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (_all_checks, _file, _totals).",
  "sinks": "None explicitly identified; no data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only imports functions and declares exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code solely handles module imports and defines the public API. It imports functions check_all, check_all_files, and check_totals from internal modules, then sets __all__ to expose these functions. There is no dynamic execution, no handling of untrusted input, no network activity, or other suspicious behavior. The structure and content are typical for Python modules meant for API exposure.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward module interface definition without any malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain obfuscation, malware, or suspicious logic. It is a benign and standard pattern in Python package development.",
