  "purpose": "Define module exports by importing specific functions from internal modules.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (_all_checks, _file, _totals). No external or user input data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data sinks or output functions are present that handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; this is a simple export definition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports functions from internal modules and defines an export list. There are no network operations, data processing, or code execution; it serves as a straightforward module initializer. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module export pattern with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It appears to be a benign part of a larger codebase, simply organizing exports.",
