{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define module exports and imports for a Python package, specifically re-exporting functions from internal modules.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (_all_checks, _file, _totals) and the __all__ declaration listing exported functions.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks; no untrusted data handling or external outputs present in this fragment.",
  "flows": "The code imports functions from internal modules and exposes them via __all__, but no data flows or processing are shown.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious variables, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward imports and module exports, a common pattern for organizing Python packages. It does not contain any input handling, data processing, or external communication. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or unusual behavior in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup for a Python package, with no malicious intent or security risks detected based on this fragment.",
