  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward module that imports functions from internal modules and defines the `__all__` list for public API exposure.\n- No data sinks, external communication, or data processing are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code is standard for Python package setup.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code snippets are consistent across reports.\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1, which seems appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n- Malware scores are 0 across all reports, aligning with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- Security risk scores are also 0, consistent with the lack of security concerns.\n\n**Critical evaluation:**\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is benign and typical.\n- There are no claims based on assumptions that need challenging.\n- The scores seem reasonable and aligned with the code's behavior.\n\n**My assessment:**\n- The code does not contain any malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The malware score should remain at 0.\n- The obfuscated score is correctly at 0.\n- The overall security risk is minimal, at 0.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- I agree with the provided reports' assessments.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a benign, standard module setup with no security concerns.",
