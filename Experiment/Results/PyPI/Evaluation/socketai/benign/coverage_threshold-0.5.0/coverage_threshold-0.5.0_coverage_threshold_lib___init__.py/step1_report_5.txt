  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules: ._all_checks, ._file, ._totals",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data sinks or external data outputs.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow present; code only imports and defines exports.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports functions from internal files and specifies them for export. It does not process or handle data directly, nor does it perform any operations that could lead to data leaks or malicious activity. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues based on this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module import/export pattern with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
