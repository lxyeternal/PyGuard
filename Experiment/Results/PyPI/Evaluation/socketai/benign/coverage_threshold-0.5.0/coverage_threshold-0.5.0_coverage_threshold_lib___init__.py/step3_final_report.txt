  "purpose": "This code defines the public API of a Python package module by importing internal functions and setting the __all__ list.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (_all_checks, _file, _totals)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data sinks are present",
  "flows": "Importing functions from internal modules; setting __all__ for API exposure",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module setup for a Python package, importing functions and defining __all__. It contains no dynamic code, external communication, or data processing. The structure is standard, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code's simplicity and clarity support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package module setup with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and justified.",
