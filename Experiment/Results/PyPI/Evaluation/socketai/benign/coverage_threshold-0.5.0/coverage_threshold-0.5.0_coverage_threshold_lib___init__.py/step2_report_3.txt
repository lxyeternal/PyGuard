  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Functionality & Presence of Issues**  \nAll reports agree that the code is a straightforward module that imports internal functions and sets the `__all__` attribute to define the public API. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, data processing, or external communication. The code appears standard and benign.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is simple, with no suspicious behavior or anomalies. No errors or logical flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation**  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity and transparency of the code.  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.  \n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified.  \n- **Confidence:** All are at 1, indicating high certainty, which is reasonable given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nSince the code is purely an import/export pattern with no suspicious behavior, scores higher than 0.5 are unwarranted. The reports correctly reflect this.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \nThe malware score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the analysis that no malicious activity is present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nNo report makes unwarranted assumptions; all correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nThe scores are consistent with the code's nature and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)  \n\nGiven the comprehensive review, I agree with the reports' conclusions. The code is a standard, safe module setup with no security concerns.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is benign and poses no security threat.",
