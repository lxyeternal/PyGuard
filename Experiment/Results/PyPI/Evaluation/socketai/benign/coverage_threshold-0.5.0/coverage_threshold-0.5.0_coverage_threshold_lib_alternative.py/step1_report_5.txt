  "purpose": "Utility function to return the first non-None value among two options.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'left' and 'right' (function arguments).",
  "sinks": "Return statement uses the inputs directly; no external sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Input variables 'left' and 'right' are evaluated and returned; no external data flow or untrusted sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns. Function is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a generic fallback function that returns the first argument if it is not None, otherwise returns the second argument. The function includes docstring with tests, verifying expected behavior. No external input, network calls, or data leaks are present. The logic is simple and standard, with no signs of malicious intent. The use of Optional and TypeVar is typical for type hinting in Python. Overall, the code performs a basic null-coalescing operation without any malicious or suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple utility function with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs a common pattern of fallback logic safely, with no anomalies or malicious intent detected.",
