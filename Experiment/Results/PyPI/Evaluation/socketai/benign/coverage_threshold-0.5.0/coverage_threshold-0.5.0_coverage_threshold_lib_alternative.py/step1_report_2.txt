  "purpose": "Utility function to select the first non-None value between two options.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'left' and 'right', which accept optional inputs.",
  "sinks": "Return statement providing the selected value; no external data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow directly to the return statement to determine which value to output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual language features, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a generic fallback function that returns 'left' if it is not None; otherwise, it returns 'right'. It includes docstrings with test cases verifying behavior with None and non-None objects. The implementation is straightforward, with no external data sources, unsafe operations, or suspicious constructs. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The code appears as a simple utility function for handling optional values.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility function with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It simply returns the first non-None value from two options as expected.",
