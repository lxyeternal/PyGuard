  "purpose": "A simple utility function that returns the first non-None value among two options.",
  "sources": "Parameters 'left' and 'right' passed to the function.",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs the selected value; no external data sinks or side effects.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are evaluated; if 'left' is not None, it is returned; otherwise, 'right' is returned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected; straightforward control flow.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard fallback function using a simple None check. It includes inline tests confirming expected behavior with various None and non-None inputs. No external data sources, network calls, or security-sensitive operations are present. The implementation is clear, safe, and commonly used in Python. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are identified. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility function with no malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its safety and assign appropriate scores. No modifications are necessary.",
