  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code defines a generic utility function `fallback` that returns `left` if it is not `None`; otherwise, it returns `right`.\n- It includes type hints and inline docstring tests verifying behavior with various combinations of `None` and non-`None` objects.\n- The implementation is straightforward, with no external data sources, side effects, or complex logic.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** The code matches the description; no issues or anomalies are present.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected; the function performs a simple `None` check and return.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risks:** None evident; no external data handling, network calls, or sensitive operations.\n\n### Review of individual reports:\nAll reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and performs a common fallback operation. They assign:\n- **Malware scores:** 0 or 0.0, consistent with no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** 0 or 0.0, matching the clarity of the code.\n- **Security risk scores:** 0 or 0.0, aligned with the absence of vulnerabilities.\n\n### Scores justification:\n- The **malware score** should be **0** since there's no malicious behavior.\n- The **obfuscated score** should be **0** as the code is not obfuscated.\n- The **security risk score** should be **0** given the lack of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is a standard utility function with no security concerns.\n- No assumptions or speculative vulnerabilities are made.\n- The test cases and logic are clear and safe.\n\n### Final recommendation:\nGiven the analysis, I agree with the provided scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign, straightforward utility function with no security or malicious concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final note:** No further action needed; the code is safe and well-understood.",
