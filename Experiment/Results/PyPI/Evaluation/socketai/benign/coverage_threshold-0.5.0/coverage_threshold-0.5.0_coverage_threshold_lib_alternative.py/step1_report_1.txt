  "purpose": "Utility function to select the first non-None value between two optional values",
  "sources": "None; 'left' and 'right' parameters, which are optionally provided objects",
  "sinks": "The return statement, which outputs one of the input objects based on None checks",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'left' and 'right' flow into the return statement; the function logic directs which object is returned based on their None status",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The function performs a straightforward None check and return logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple utility function 'fallback' that returns 'left' if it is not None; otherwise, it returns 'right'. It includes type hints and docstring with usage examples. No external data sources or untrusted inputs are processed within this function. The logic is standard and safe, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. It performs basic control flow without any system calls, network activity, or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility function with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is straightforward, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns observed.",
