{
  "purpose": "The function 'fallback' returns the first non-None value between two inputs, or None if both are None.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources; function arguments are the only data inputs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs that handle untrusted data; function returns a value based on input checks.",
  "flows": "Input variables 'left' and 'right' are checked and potentially returned, but no external data flow or untrusted source is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward and well-structured; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a generic function to select the first non-None value between two options, with inline docstring including tests. No external input, no data leakage, no unsafe operations, or suspicious logic. The implementation is simple and does not perform any network activity, system modification, or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility function with no malicious intent or security concerns. It performs a basic fallback operation without any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
