  "purpose": "A utility function to return the first non-None value among two options, with included docstring tests.",
  "sources": "The function reads the input parameters 'left' and 'right'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs are present; no data leakage or external effects are identified.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are directly returned based on their None status; no complex data flow or external data manipulation occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a generic fallback function that returns 'left' if it is not None, otherwise 'right'. It includes docstring examples that test various cases. There are no external data sources, sinks, or complex data flows. The logic is simple and intended for utility use only. No signs of malicious behavior, such as malicious code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are present. The code adheres to standard Python practices and contains no suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility function with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs a standard fallback operation and is safe for use.",
