{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an __init__.py file, defining the public API for a Python package by importing specific functions and variables from internal modules.",
  "sources": "Imports from .cli, .lib, and .model modules.",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or environment variable interactions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only re-exports functions and variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and typical for a package's __init__.py file.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions and variables from internal modules and exposes them via __all__ for public API. It does not include any data handling, user input, or external communication. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic. This pattern is standard for Python packages and does not inherently pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initializer with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply re-exports selected components for public use, with no suspicious behavior detected.",
