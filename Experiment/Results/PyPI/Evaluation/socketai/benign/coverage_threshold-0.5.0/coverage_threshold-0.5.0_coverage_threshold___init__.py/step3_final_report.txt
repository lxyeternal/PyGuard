  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initializer (__init__.py) that imports specific functions and variables from internal modules and exposes them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from .cli, .lib, and .model modules",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, network communication, or external data sinks are present",
  "flows": "Import sources are assigned to module namespace and exposed via __all__; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import/export pattern, no obfuscation, secrets, or malicious code",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package __init__.py file that imports internal components and exposes them via __all__. No data handling, network activity, or user input processing is present. The code structure is typical and does not contain obfuscation or malicious patterns. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The confidence scores are high, reflecting certainty in the benign assessment. No suspicious signals or anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initializer with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
