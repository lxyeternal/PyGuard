{
  "purpose": "This code defines module exports and imports specific functions and variables from other modules within the package, likely for use in a command-line interface or API.",
  "sources": "Imports from .cli, .lib, and .model modules, specifically 'main', 'check_all', 'config', and 'report'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted input or data are present; the code only imports and exports identifiers.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code does not process or handle data directly.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated elements, or hidden behaviors are present. The code is straightforward module import/export statements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of import statements and an __all__ list defining public API exports. It does not include data processing, user input, network activity, or other operations that could introduce security risks. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are detected. It appears to be a standard Python module initializer.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical module setup for a Python package, importing functions and variables for external use. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks present.",
