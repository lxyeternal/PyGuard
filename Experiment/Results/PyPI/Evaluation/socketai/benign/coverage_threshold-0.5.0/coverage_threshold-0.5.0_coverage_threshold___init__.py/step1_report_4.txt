{
  "purpose": "This code appears to set up module exports for a Python package, exposing certain functions and variables.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .cli, .lib, .model",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or external communication occurs here",
  "flows": "No data flow paths from sources to sinks; this file only exports symbols",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; simple import and export statements",
  "analysis": "The code solely imports functions and variables from local modules and defines __all__ for exports. No data processing, no input reading, no external calls, and no suspicious or malicious code behaviors are present. It functions as a standard module interface setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical module __init__.py pattern for organizing exports, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
