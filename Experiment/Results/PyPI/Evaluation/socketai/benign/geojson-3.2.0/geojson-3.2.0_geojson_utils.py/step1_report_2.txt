  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for handling, transforming, and generating GeoJSON geometries and features.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'obj' in 'coords', 'map_coords', 'map_tuples', 'map_geometries', and 'featureType' in 'generate_random'. Internal functions generate random geometries.",
  "sinks": "No evident sink points that process untrusted data leading to security vulnerabilities; external library calls (geojson, random, math) are standard for geographic data processing.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through 'coords', 'map_coords', 'map_tuples', 'map_geometries', and 'generate_random'. Data transformation occurs via map functions and random geometry creation, but no untrusted data is propagated into dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import random' and 'import math' inside a function is unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials or secrets observed. No obfuscated code patterns or hidden backdoors. The 'generate_random' function relies on randomness for geometry creation but does not interact with external data sources or network.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard GeoJSON manipulation functions, including recursive traversal and coordinate mapping. It employs safe practices such as input validation and raises exceptions for invalid data. The 'generate_random' function creates random geographic features within specified bounds using standard libraries and algorithms, with no external data exfiltration or command execution. The use of 'import' inside functions is unconventional but not malicious. Overall, no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward utility for geographic data processing and random geometry generation without any malicious activity. It does not contain backdoors, network communications, or data exfiltration mechanisms. No security risks or malware indicators are identified.",
