  "purpose": "Utility functions for processing and generating GeoJSON coordinate data, including coordinate extraction, transformation, and random feature generation.",
  "sources": "Functions like coords, map_coords, map_tuples, map_geometries, and generate_random read data from input GeoJSON objects or generate new data based on parameters.",
  "sinks": "The functions output transformed GeoJSON data structures or generators; no direct sinks for untrusted data are evident, but the generate_random function creates potentially untrusted GeoJSON objects.",
  "flows": "Input data (GeoJSON objects or parameters) flows through functions like coords, map_coords, map_tuples, and map_geometries, transforming coordinate data or generating new data. The generate_random function creates new geojson features based on parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The generate_random function imports 'random' and 'math' locally; the code does not show any suspicious or malicious behaviors like network access, data exfiltration, or backdoors. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected. No dynamic code execution or suspicious hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard utilities for extracting, mapping, and generating GeoJSON coordinate data. It handles nested structures with recursion and supports multiple geometry types. The generate_random function produces random geographical features within specified bounding boxes, using random number generation for coordinate creation. All functions rely on standard Python libraries and open-source geojson modules. No indications of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration are present. The code appears to serve legitimate purposes of geographic data manipulation and generation.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of well-structured, legitimate geographic data utility functions with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or harmful behaviors. It performs coordinate processing and random feature generation for mapping purposes, with no network access or data leakage mechanisms. Overall, it appears safe and benign.",
