  "purpose": "Utility functions for processing, transforming, and generating GeoJSON geographic data structures.",
  "sources": "Function parameters, imported modules (geojson, random, math).",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that send untrusted data over networks, write to files, or access sensitive system resources.",
  "flows": "Data flows primarily within GeoJSON structures through transformations and coordinate extractions; no external data flow or untrusted input handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. The 'generate_random' function uses random module for feature creation but does not contain malicious code. No obfuscated code detected; functions are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code provides GeoJSON coordinate extraction, mapping, and random feature generation. It imports standard modules and external 'geojson' library but does not perform any network operations, file IO, or system modifications. The random feature generator is deterministic and solely creates geographic features within specified bounds. No signs of data exfiltration, malicious behavior, or sabotage. No suspicious logic or anomalies are present. All functions process data internally, with clear, standard logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of geographic data utility functions with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It performs data transformations and random geographic feature generation safely. No security risks or malware are detected.",
