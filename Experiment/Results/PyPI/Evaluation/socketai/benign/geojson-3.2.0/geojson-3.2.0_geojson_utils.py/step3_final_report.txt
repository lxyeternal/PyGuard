  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for extracting, transforming, and generating GeoJSON coordinate data, including random feature creation.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from GeoJSON objects, feature collections, geometries, and parameters for random generation.",
  "sinks": "Outputs transformed GeoJSON structures or coordinate tuples; no external data exfiltration or system modification.",
  "flows": "Source data (GeoJSON objects or parameters) flows through coordinate extraction or transformation functions, resulting in modified GeoJSON or coordinate lists.",
  "anomalies": "Unconventional local imports within functions, but no malicious or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard geospatial utility functions relying on common libraries ('geojson', 'random', 'math'). No network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The functions perform data extraction, coordinate mapping, and random feature generation with clear logic. No obfuscation or hardcoded secrets are identified. The local imports are unconventional but benign. The code's purpose is legitimate, and no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of geospatial utilities with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1). The existing reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
