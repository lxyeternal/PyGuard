  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling, transforming, and generating GeoJSON coordinate data.",
  "sources": "Input parameters, function arguments, and data from provided objects like 'obj' and 'featureType'.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks where untrusted data is directly written or sent; no network operations or file writes observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input objects through coordinate extraction, transformation functions, and random feature generation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. The random feature generator relies on the 'random' module, but this is a typical utility. No obfuscation, malicious obfuscation, or hidden code identified.",
  "analysis": "The code provides functions to extract coordinates from various GeoJSON structures, transform these coordinates with user-provided functions, and generate random GeoJSON features within specified bounds. The functions are standard for geospatial data manipulation, utilizing recursive calls, type checking, and well-known modules such as 'geojson' and 'random'. The random generation function creates typical geometric shapes with no suspicious behavior. All data handling appears to be contained within the scope of normal GeoJSON processing, with no network, file, or system manipulation observed. No unusual code constructs, no encoding tricks, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of utility functions for GeoJSON manipulation and generation with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration mechanisms. It is standard geospatial code with safe patterns. No malware or security risks are evident.",
