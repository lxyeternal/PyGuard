  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: presence of malicious code, obfuscation, security risks, and the validity of the scores assigned.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements from the 'geojson' package modules, followed by defining the `__all__` attribute for module exports.\n- No report indicates any dynamic code execution, data processing, user input handling, network activity, or other behaviors that could be malicious.\n- The code appears to be standard boilerplate or module initialization code, typical for Python packages.\n- The malware scores are all 0, aligning with the analysis that no malicious activity is present.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward nature of the code.\n- Security risk scores are all 0, as no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are identified.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The reports consistently conclude that the code is safe, standard, and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, indicating high certainty in these assessments.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the code content.\n\n**Potential issues or points of contention:**\n- Since the code is purely import statements and an `__all__` declaration, there is no basis for any higher risk or malware scores.\n- The reasoning in all reports is consistent and sound.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security concerns)\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports correctly identify the code as standard module setup with no security issues. The scores are appropriate, and no changes are warranted.",
