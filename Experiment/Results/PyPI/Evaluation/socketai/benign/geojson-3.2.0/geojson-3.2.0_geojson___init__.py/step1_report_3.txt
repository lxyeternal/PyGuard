{
  "purpose": "The code imports various modules and functions from the 'geojson' library and defines the __all__ attribute to specify exported symbols.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'geojson.codec', 'geojson.utils', 'geojson.geometry', 'geojson.feature', 'geojson.base', and 'geojson._version'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that execute untrusted data; no network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports modules and assigns __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of import statements from a known library ('geojson') and an assignment to __all__ for module exports. There are no functions, data processing, or external interactions that could be exploited. The use of __all__ is standard practice to control symbol exports and does not introduce security risks. No malicious patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious data flows are present.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a straightforward module import and export declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be part of a larger package, focusing on exporting geojson functionalities for use elsewhere.",
