{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer or API export file, importing various components from the 'geojson' package and defining the __all__ list for public API exposure.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'geojson' modules, reading module attributes and functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, no data leaks, no external data handling or network operations.",
  "flows": "Import statements and __all__ assignment; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, standard package setup code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and an __all__ declaration, typical for a package's __init__.py. It does not process data, handle user input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the benign nature of the code. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module setup file with no security risks or malicious intent. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
