{
  "purpose": "This code is setting up imports and exports for a Python package related to geojson data handling, focusing on serialization, geometry, and features.",
  "sources": "Imports from the 'geojson' library modules such as codec, utils, geometry, feature, base, and version information.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or user input are present in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "This code only imports components and defines the __all__ list for module exports; it does not process or handle external data or inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are observed. The code appears to be straightforward package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code solely performs import statements and constructs the __all__ list for module exports. There are no data flows, input handling, or dynamic code execution. It imports classes, functions, and version info from a well-known geojson library and consolidates them for export. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard module setup code for a geojson package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and normal.",
