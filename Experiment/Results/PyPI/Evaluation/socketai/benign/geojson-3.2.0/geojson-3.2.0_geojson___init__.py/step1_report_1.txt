{
  "purpose": "This code imports various functions, classes, and version information from the 'geojson' package modules, and defines the __all__ attribute for module exports.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the 'geojson' package modules: geojson.codec, geojson.utils, geojson.geometry, geojson.feature, geojson.base, and geojson._version.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process or handle untrusted data directly; it only imports modules and defines an export list.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks as there are no data manipulations or untrusted data handling present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors observed. The code solely imports standard library components and sets an export list.",
  "analysis": "The script imports multiple functions, classes, and version info from the 'geojson' package modules, then consolidates them into the __all__ attribute for public API exposure. There are no dynamic code executions, external data processing, or handling of user input. The code appears to be a standard module initialization pattern without any signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical module import and export definition with no malicious behavior, no data handling, and no security concerns. It is standard boilerplate code for exposing package components.",
