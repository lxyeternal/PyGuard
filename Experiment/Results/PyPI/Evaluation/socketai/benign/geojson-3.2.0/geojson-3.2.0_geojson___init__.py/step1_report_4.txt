{
  "purpose": "This code imports various components from the geojson library for handling GeoJSON data structures and re-exports them for external use.",
  "sources": "Imported modules and attributes from the 'geojson' library, including functions, classes, and version info.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling, user input, or network operations observed.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from external input to critical functions or data leaks are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; the __all__ list comprehensively exports imported items, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs import statements and constructs the __all__ list for module exports. It references internal library components and version information, all standard for a module's __init__.py or API definition. No code execution, input handling, or data manipulation occurs. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The code appears to be a straightforward re-export of geojson library components for external use.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical module initialization or API export file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply imports and re-exports components from the 'geojson' library, with no malicious or suspicious code detected.",
