{
  "purpose": "This code imports various components from the geojson library for encoding, decoding, and handling GeoJSON objects, and then exports these components.",
  "sources": "Imports from geojson modules: geojson.codec, geojson.utils, geojson.geometry, geojson.feature, geojson.base, geojson._version",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted input data or perform sensitive operations are present in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code only imports modules and defines __all__, no data flow or processing occurs here.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code strictly performs module imports and exports.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it imports specific functions, classes, and version info from the geojson package modules and aggregates them into the __all__ list for export. There are no dynamic code executions, input handling, or network operations. The structure and content are consistent with standard Python module organization. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module import and export setup for the geojson package. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and does not perform any data processing or network activity. It is safe and appears to be part of a library’s interface definition.",
