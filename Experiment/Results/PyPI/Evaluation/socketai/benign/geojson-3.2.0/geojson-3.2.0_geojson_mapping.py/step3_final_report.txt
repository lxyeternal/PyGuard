  "purpose": "Utility functions for checking if an object is a mapping and converting objects to mappings, with special handling for geojson objects and normalization via JSON serialization/deserialization.",
  "sources": "Access to object attributes (__geo_interface__), type checks, geojson.GeoJSON instances, json.dumps() and json.loads() on arbitrary objects.",
  "sinks": "json.dumps() and json.loads() on untrusted objects, which could potentially be exploited if objects contain malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "Input objects are checked for __geo_interface__ attribute or type; if not, they are serialized to JSON and deserialized back, which could be exploited if the objects are maliciously crafted.",
  "anomalies": "Use of json.dumps() and json.loads() on arbitrary objects as a normalization step; no other suspicious or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for handling geojson and mapping objects, with a fallback serialization/deserialization step for normalization. The pattern of serializing and deserializing arbitrary objects can be risky if the objects are maliciously crafted, but within this context, it appears to be a benign normalization method. No external network calls, hardcoded secrets, or code execution are present. The use of standard libraries and well-known third-party packages indicates low likelihood of malicious intent. The potential risk stems from processing untrusted data via JSON, which could lead to errors or resource exhaustion if exploited, but no such malicious behavior is evident in the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for handling geojson and mapping objects, with no signs of malicious code or backdoors. The use of JSON serialization/deserialization on arbitrary objects introduces a minor security concern if used with untrusted data elsewhere, but within this snippet, it is a common pattern. Overall, the code is benign, with a very low security risk. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting minor concerns about untrusted data processing.",
