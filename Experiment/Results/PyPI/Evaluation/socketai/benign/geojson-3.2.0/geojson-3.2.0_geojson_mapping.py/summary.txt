  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for handling geojson and mapping objects, with no signs of malicious code or backdoors. The use of JSON serialization/deserialization on arbitrary objects introduces a minor security concern if used with untrusted data elsewhere, but within this snippet, it is a common pattern. Overall, the code is benign, with a very low security risk. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting minor concerns about untrusted data processing."
