{
  "purpose": "Utility functions to determine if an object is a mapping and to convert objects to mapping structures, primarily for geojson data handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads imported modules, attribute access on objects, and data passed to functions such as 'to_mapping'.",
  "sinks": "JSON serialization/deserialization (json.dumps and json.loads), attribute access, type checking, and dictionary conversion.",
  "flows": "Input data is checked for specific attributes or types; if necessary, data is serialized to JSON string and then deserialized back into a Python object.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscation. Use of json serialization could potentially be exploited if untrusted data is passed, but not malicious per se.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules for JSON handling and geojson processing, defines utility functions for identifying mapping objects, and converts objects to mappings via attribute access, type checking, and JSON serialization/deserialization. The use of json.dumps and json.loads on potentially untrusted data could be a minor concern, but it is standard for data normalization. No external network or system access, no backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. The code appears to be a straightforward utility module with no suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for handling geojson objects and mappings, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any external communications or harmful operations.",
