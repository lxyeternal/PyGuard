  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as utility functions for checking and converting objects to mappings, especially handling geojson objects.\n- The main potential security concern highlighted is the pattern `json.dumps(obj)` followed by `json.loads()` on arbitrary objects, which could, in theory, be exploited if the objects are maliciously crafted.\n- No reports mention external network activity, code execution, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, indicating no malicious activity detected.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or 1), suggesting the reviewers are confident in their assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The core logic of the code matches the description.\n- The pattern `json.loads(json.dumps(obj))` is standard for deep copying or normalization but can be risky if the object contains malicious data, especially if custom encoders are involved.\n- No actual vulnerabilities or malicious code are present.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- The reports do not identify any concrete vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n- The security risk scores are uniformly low (0.1 to 0.2), which is reasonable given the context.\n- The reasoning is consistent across reports; no contradictions or unreasonable scores are evident.\n\n### Score analysis:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting minor concerns about JSON serialization/deserialization on untrusted data, which is standard practice but could be exploited in specific scenarios.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign risk scores above 0.5, which is appropriate. The highest is 0.2, aligning with minor concerns about processing untrusted data.\n\n### Potential discrepancies:\n- The reports are consistent with each other and with the code. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n**Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 — minor, standard data normalization concerns.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\nGiven the analysis, I would assign:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (since the only concern is JSON serialization/deserialization of potentially untrusted data, which is a common pattern but not inherently malicious)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign utility module with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The minor risk stems from the serialization/deserialization pattern, which is standard but should be used cautiously with untrusted data. Overall, the supply chain risk is very low.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No further action or suspicion is warranted based on these reports.",
