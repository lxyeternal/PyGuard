  "purpose": "Define GeoJSON Feature and FeatureCollection classes for GIS data handling",
  "sources": "Imports from geojson.base, class initializations, method calls like self.get, self['key'], and super().__init__",
  "sinks": "Potentially any use of self['id'], self['geometry'], self['properties'], or self['features'] that could involve untrusted data, but these are only data containers and do not perform I/O or network operations",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor parameters into object properties; no external or untrusted data sources or sinks involved; no execution of external commands",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated constructs. The code appears standard for data model classes. The __getitem__ method includes exception handling but no malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for GIS features inheriting from a base GeoJSON class. Initialization involves setting properties from parameters. Methods include error checks and custom item access with exception handling. No external input, network, or file operations are present. No suspicious logic, code injection, or data leakage points are observed. Usage of self.get and self['key'] are typical for dictionary-like objects, and error handling is standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of GIS data models without any malicious intent or security issues. No signs of supply chain attacks, malware, or malicious behavior are evident.",
