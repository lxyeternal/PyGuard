  "purpose": "Define classes for representing GeoJSON features and feature collections, extending base GeoJSON functionality.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs; relies on class instantiation with parameters.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks or external outputs; no network, file, or environment interaction.",
  "flows": "Data flows occur within object attributes and method calls, primarily in class constructors and error methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior observed. The class methods are standard for handling GeoJSON objects.",
  "analysis": "The code implements two classes, Feature and FeatureCollection, extending a base GeoJSON class. The constructors initialize attributes like 'id', 'geometry', and 'properties' for Feature, and 'features' for FeatureCollection. The error methods delegate to geometry errors or list error checks. No user input, external data, or network interactions are present. The code appears straightforward, with no obfuscation, malicious patterns, or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be standard GeoJSON data structure definitions with no malicious intent, no suspicious data handling, and no security risks. It solely manages data structures related to geographic features.",
