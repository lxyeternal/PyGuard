  "purpose": "Define classes for GeoJSON features and feature collections with validation and error checking.",
  "sources": "Initialization methods, property accessors, and error methods; primarily reading input parameters, object properties, and internal attributes.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data outputs or network calls.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (id, geometry, properties, features) to internal attributes; property accessors to error methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious external calls, no obfuscated code, and no unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data model classes for GeoJSON features, extending a base class GeoJSON. It includes constructors initializing attributes, with optional parameters, and error-checking methods. There is no code that reads from untrusted sources, does network operations, or manipulates sensitive data. The methods perform straightforward data assignments and retrievals. The 'errors' method calls, but does not implement any network or file operations, nor does it process untrusted input in an unsafe manner. No anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of GeoJSON data structures with validation and error checking. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data flows, and appears safe for use. The code is well-structured for its purpose without any signs of sabotage or malware.",
