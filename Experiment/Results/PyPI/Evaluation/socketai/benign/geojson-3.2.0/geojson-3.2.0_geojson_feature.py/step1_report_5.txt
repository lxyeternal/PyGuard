  "purpose": "Define classes for handling GeoJSON features and feature collections with validation.",
  "sources": "Class instantiation, attribute access, method calls (e.g., __init__, get, errors).",
  "sinks": "Superclass method calls, attribute modifications, error handling, potential data retrieval via get method.",
  "flows": "Initialization and method calls pass data to superclass or within class attributes; no external data flows evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. Use of inheritance and potential error handling does not suggest malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for GeoJSON objects, extending a base class, with straightforward data handling, initialization, and error checking. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code constructs are present. The code primarily manages in-memory data structures without external data sources or sinks. No obfuscated logic, external commands, or hidden behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign implementation of GeoJSON feature handling classes. It serves data encapsulation and validation purposes without any malicious intent or security risks.",
