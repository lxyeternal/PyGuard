  "purpose": "Define GeoJSON-based classes for representing GIS features and feature collections, enabling structured handling of spatial data.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to constructors (id, geometry, properties, features), and the 'geometry' object in Feature.",
  "sinks": "None evident; the code does not perform data output or network transmission.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to internal methods and attribute assignments; no data flows to external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns observed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external data fetching.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides class definitions for handling GeoJSON features, with initialization and error checking methods. It relies on superclass 'GeoJSON' and expected external data structures. No data is read from external sources, nor are there any sinks or external communications. The code structure is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of GeoJSON data structures for GIS applications. There are no indications of malicious intent, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities. It does not contain malware or obfuscated code. Overall, this code is safe for use.",
