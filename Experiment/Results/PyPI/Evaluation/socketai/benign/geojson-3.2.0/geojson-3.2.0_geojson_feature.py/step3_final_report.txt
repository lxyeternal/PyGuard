  "purpose": "Define classes for GeoJSON features and feature collections with validation.",
  "sources": "Initialization parameters, property accessors, error methods, class attributes.",
  "sinks": "None.",
  "flows": "Data from constructor parameters to object attributes; internal method calls.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; standard data modeling code.",
  "analysis": "The code implements data classes for GeoJSON features and collections, extending a base class 'GeoJSON'. It performs attribute assignments, validation via 'errors()' methods, and internal data management. No external I/O, network communication, or malicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious logic. The methods delegate validation to other functions, likely safe. Overall, it appears to be a benign, standard implementation of data structures for GIS features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation of GeoJSON data models with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports—malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1—are consistent with the code's benign nature. No modifications are necessary.",
