{
  "purpose": "To set up and configure the Python package 'geojson' for distribution, including reading version info and README content.",
  "sources": "Reads README.rst file for long description, reads _version.py for version string, inspects sys.version_info for Python version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; setup() function uses static configuration and read files only.",
  "flows": "Reads version string from _version.py, reads README file, checks Python version, then calls setup() with static parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with version extraction and Python version check.",
  "analysis": "The script reads the README file for package description, extracts version info from a designated version file using regex, and enforces Python version constraints. It then proceeds to configure package setup with static metadata and dependencies. No user input, network activity, or untrusted data is processed or used in a way that could lead to security issues. The code is standard for Python package setup scripts and contains no obfuscated or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks. It properly reads static files and enforces compatible Python versions without involving untrusted sources or executing arbitrary code. The overall security risk is minimal.",
