{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for the 'geojson' Python package, responsible for reading package metadata, extracting version info, validating Python version compatibility, and invoking setuptools.setup() with static metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' for long description, reading 'geojson/_version.py' for version string, checking sys.version_info for Python version validation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the script only reads files and outputs to stderr or raises exceptions.",
  "flows": "Version string read from file -> regex extraction -> version used in setup() -> Python version check -> script execution proceeds if valid.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, static, and performs standard setup tasks without obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup procedures: reading static files, extracting version info via regex, validating Python version, and calling setup() with static metadata. No suspicious or malicious behavior, external network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The regex for version extraction is conventional, and the Python version check is explicit. The code is clear, readable, and follows common practices. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external dependencies are involved. The minimal security risk score (~0.1) assigned in the reports reflects the benign nature of the script, which only performs static configuration tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. No further action or modification is necessary.",
