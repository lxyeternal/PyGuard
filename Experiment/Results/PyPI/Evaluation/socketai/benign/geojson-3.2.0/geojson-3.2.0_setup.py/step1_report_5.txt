{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration script for the 'geojson' Python package, including version extraction, dependency requirements, and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.rst file for long description, reads the version string from geojson/_version.py, inspects sys.version_info for Python version compatibility.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes to stderr and exits if Python version is incompatible; no other untrusted data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from _version.py and uses it in setup; checks Python version compatibility, then proceeds to setup with static metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors observed. Use of regex to extract version is standard. Version check enforces Python version compatibility; no malicious intent evident.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup tasks: reading a README for long description, extracting the version from a file, verifying Python version compatibility, and calling setuptools.setup() with static and dynamic data. All operations are typical for Python package setup scripts. No obfuscated code, suspicious network activity, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a conventional setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply reads metadata, verifies Python version, and calls setup().",
