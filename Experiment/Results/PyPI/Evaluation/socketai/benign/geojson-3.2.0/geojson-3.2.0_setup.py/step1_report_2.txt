  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the 'geojson' Python package, including version extraction, dependency management, and metadata definition.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' for long description, reading version string from 'geojson/_version.py', and obtaining Python version info from sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data is written to external systems or outputs in an insecure manner.",
  "flows": "Version string extraction from a file to the setup configuration; Python version check to enforce compatibility.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code performs standard setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a README file for long description, extracts version info from a version file using regex, checks Python runtime version compatibility, and invokes setuptools.setup() with package metadata. All steps follow standard practices for package setup. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or suspicious external connections. The code appears to be a typical setup script with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration script with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs typical package setup tasks safely.",
