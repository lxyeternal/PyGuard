{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'geojson' Python package, used to define package metadata and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads README.rst file for long description; reads __version__ string from geojson/_version.py; checks Python version compatibility.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes untrusted data, executes external commands, or uses dangerous APIs.",
  "flows": "Reads version string -> Validates Python version -> Calls setup() with package info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual constructs detected. Version extraction via regex appears standard; no obfuscation or malicious pattern.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks: reading a README file, extracting version info from a version file with regex, validating Python interpreter version, and calling setuptools.setup() with package metadata. No suspicious data flows or external data manipulations are present. The version extraction method using regex is typical and safe; the Python version check ensures compatibility. No anomalies like hardcoded secrets or backdoors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign setup script for a Python package. No malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks are evident.",
