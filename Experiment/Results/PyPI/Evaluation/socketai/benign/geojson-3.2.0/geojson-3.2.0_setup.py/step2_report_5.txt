  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports describe the same code: a standard Python package setup script.\n- They note that the script reads a README file, extracts version info via regex from `geojson/_version.py`, checks Python version compatibility, and calls `setup()` with static metadata.\n- No suspicious or malicious behaviors are identified in any report.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low security risk (~0.1 to 0).\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n\n1. **Code correctness and presence of issues:**\n   - The code appears straightforward and standard for a setup script.\n   - The version extraction via regex is common practice.\n   - Python version validation is explicit and safe.\n   - No code injection, external network calls, or user input processing.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n   - No logical errors or security flaws detected.\n   - The only minor point is that the script assumes the version string exists in a specific format; if the `_version.py` format changes, it could break, but this is standard practice.\n\n3. **Scores assigned in reports:**\n   - Malware: 0 in all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - Obfuscated: 0, consistent with no obfuscation.\n   - Security risk: very low (~0.1), justified by the standard nature of the script.\n   \n   **Suggestion:** The small security risk score (~0.1) seems appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of external dependencies or user input. No change needed.\n\n4. **Risk justification:**\n   - Since the code is a benign setup script, the risk score of 0.1 is reasonable, reflecting minimal security concern.\n   - The malware score remains at 0, correctly indicating no malicious activity.\n\n5. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code performs only setup tasks.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions about malicious intent are made.\n\n6. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is a standard, transparent setup script.\n- No malicious or suspicious activity detected.\n- The minimal risk score accounts for the fact that the script reads files and performs version validation, which is typical and safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis reflects a standard, secure setup script with negligible security concern.",
