{
  "purpose": "This script sets up a Python package named 'geojson' by reading package metadata, version info, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads README.rst for long description; reads version string from geojson/_version.py; reads sys.version_info; reads version string with regex.",
  "sinks": "Potential injection points include the 'read()' calls, especially the version file; no other direct data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Reads version string from file -> uses regex to extract version -> verifies Python version compatibility -> runs setup() with metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. Use of regex for version parsing is standard; no obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward package setup tasks: reading files for metadata, validating Python version, and calling setup(). The version is extracted via regex from a known file, and Python version compatibility is enforced. No user input is processed, and no network or system modifications occur. All operations are standard and secure. No anomalies, malicious behaviors, or suspicious code structures identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It strictly performs package metadata processing and environment validation.",
