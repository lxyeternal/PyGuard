  "purpose": "Define the public API of a module by re-exporting specific classes from the 'geojson' library.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from 'geojson.geometry', 'geojson.feature', and 'geojson.base' modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; purely static imports and list construction.",
  "flows": "Imports are static; __all__ list is constructed from imported classes without dynamic data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, explicit, and static with no obfuscation or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from the 'geojson' library modules and constructs the __all__ list via list concatenation. There are no dynamic imports, no code execution, no handling of untrusted data, and no obfuscation. All reports correctly identify this as a benign, standard pattern for defining a module's public API. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is a simple, static module for API surface definition, with no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static module that re-exports classes from the 'geojson' library. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation. The provided reports and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
