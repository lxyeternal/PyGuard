{
  "purpose": "The code imports various classes from the 'geojson' library modules related to geometries, features, and base types, and then defines __all__ for module exports.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'geojson' package modules: geojson.geometry, geojson.feature, and geojson.base.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks that process untrusted data or perform output operations. The code only imports classes and defines __all__.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks, as the code only performs static imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code appears standard for a module exposing certain classes.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static imports of geometry, feature, and base classes from the 'geojson' package, and sets __all__ to specify exported symbols. It is purely declarative with no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The structure is typical for defining a module interface. No signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module import and export setup with no malicious or security concerns. It appears to be a normal part of a Python package designed to re-export classes from the 'geojson' library.",
