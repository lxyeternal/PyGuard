  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n**Summary of the code:**\nThe provided code imports specific classes from the 'geojson' library modules and constructs the `__all__` list to specify what symbols are exported when the module is imported. The code is static, straightforward, and typical for defining a public API surface.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports agree that the code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The code is simply importing classes and defining `__all__`.  \n  **Yes, the code matches the reports' descriptions.**\n\n---\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- **Logical or security flaws?**  \n  No. The code is static, explicit, and standard.  \n  **No errors or flaws are present.**\n\n---\n\n### Scores and their Reasonableness:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.  \n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is correct.  \n- **Risk score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is justified because there's no evidence of security issues or malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe scores are consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Claims about potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify that this code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Any inconsistencies?**  \n  No. The assessments are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\nGiven the detailed analysis and the reports' consensus, I concur that:\n- The code is a benign, static module defining exports.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security risk behaviors are present.\n- The scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is safe and typical for a Python package module setup.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and no further action or concern is warranted. The code is a straightforward, benign API definition with no security issues.",
