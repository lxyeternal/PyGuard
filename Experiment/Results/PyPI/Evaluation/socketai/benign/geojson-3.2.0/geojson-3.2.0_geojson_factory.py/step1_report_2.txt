{
  "purpose": "The code defines and exports a list of classes and functions related to geojson geometries and features for use in geographic data processing.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the 'geojson' package modules; __all__ list for exporting symbols.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data affects system behavior or leaks occur.",
  "flows": "Imports are gathered at the beginning; __all__ exports are constructed from imported classes/functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no unusual code constructs, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from the 'geojson' package modules, then constructs an __all__ list to specify exported symbols. There is no input handling, no data processing, no external network access, and no dynamic execution. The code's structure appears standard and straightforward, solely defining what symbols to export.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard module import and export configuration for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
