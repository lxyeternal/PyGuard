{
  "purpose": "This code defines __all__ to export various classes and objects from the geojson library modules related to geometric and feature data structures.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing classes from 'geojson.geometry', 'geojson.feature', and 'geojson.base' modules.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that execute untrusted data or perform data leak operations.",
  "flows": "The code imports classes and then aggregates them into __all__, with no data flow or execution of untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, dynamic execution, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports specific classes from the 'geojson' package modules and assigns them to __all__ for export. This is a common pattern for defining module exports. No user input is read, no data is processed, and no potential security vulnerabilities are evident. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices. There are no signs of malicious behavior or backdoors, and no suspicious data flows or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup for exporting specific classes from the 'geojson' package. It contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a benign and typical use of Python import and export syntax.",
