{
  "purpose": "This code defines exports for a module related to geojson geometry and feature classes, enabling their import elsewhere.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the 'geojson' library modules; the __all__ variable that aggregates the imported classes.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or user input; no data processing or external communications are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only performs static imports and assigns an export list.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs; imports are standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple classes from the 'geojson' library modules and then sets the __all__ variable to define public exports for the module. The structure is typical for a Python module that re-exports classes for easier access. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code. The imports are static, and the __all__ variable only lists these classes, which aligns with standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module re-exporting geojson classes with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is a typical pattern for simplifying imports in larger projects.",
