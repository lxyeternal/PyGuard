  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code performs static imports from the 'geojson' library modules.\n   - It constructs the `__all__` list via straightforward list concatenation of imported classes.\n   - There are no dynamic constructs, no execution of untrusted input, no obfuscation, and no code that would suggest malicious intent.\n   - The purpose appears to be to define the public API of a module that re-exports specific classes from the 'geojson' package.\n\n2. **Security and Malicious Behavior:**\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n   - The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code.\n   - The structure is standard for a module that re-exports symbols for convenience.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, explicit import statements.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, justified by the lack of any security concern or malicious activity.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - The code is very simple and standard; no issues or anomalies are detected.\n   - The reports are consistent in their assessment and scoring.\n   - No changes are necessary; the scores reflect the benign nature accurately.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - Since the code only imports and exports classes, it does not pose a security risk.\n   - The purpose is purely declarative, with no indication of malicious behavior.\n   - The uniformity across reports suggests consensus on its benign nature.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThese scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and the analysis.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard module that re-exports classes from the 'geojson' library. It is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports' scores are reasonable and should remain as is.",
