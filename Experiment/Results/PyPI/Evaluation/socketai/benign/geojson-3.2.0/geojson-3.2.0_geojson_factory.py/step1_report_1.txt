{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific classes and functions from the 'geojson' library modules, and defines the __all__ list to specify what symbols are exported when the module is imported.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'geojson.geometry', 'geojson.feature', and 'geojson.base' modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data are present; the code does not execute or handle external input.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely imports and defines exports.",
  "anomalies": "The __all__ list is constructed via concatenation of class lists; no unusual code structures, obfuscation, or dynamic execution are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple classes from the 'geojson' library modules, and combines them into the __all__ variable for module exports. The imports are static, explicit, and typical for a Python package defining its public API. The __all__ list is built through straightforward list concatenation, without dynamic code or obfuscated logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears to serve as an API surface definition.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign module that specifies the public API of a 'geojson' package component. No malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks are detected.",
