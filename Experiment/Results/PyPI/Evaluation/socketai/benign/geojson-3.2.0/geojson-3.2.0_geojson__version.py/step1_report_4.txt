  "purpose": "Define package version information for the module.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string and parsing it into a tuple.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; simple assignment and parsing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, secrets, or unusual code structures observed.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to __version__, then splits it and converts each part into integers to form __version_info__. Both operations are straightforward and involve standard string manipulation. There are no external inputs, no environment variables, no network calls, and no execution of dynamic or untrusted data. The code performs basic data assignment and parsing without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for version management, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It is standard and benign.",
