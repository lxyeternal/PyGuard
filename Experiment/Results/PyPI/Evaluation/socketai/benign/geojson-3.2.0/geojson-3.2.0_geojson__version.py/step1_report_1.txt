  "purpose": "Define the version of the package as a string and as a tuple of integers for version comparison.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __version__ string and splits it to create __version_info__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not handle untrusted input or data flow.",
  "flows": "The code converts a version string into a tuple; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are evident; the code is straightforward and typical for version declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string, then creates a tuple of integers by splitting the string. This is standard practice for handling package versions. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or suspicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple version assignment with no malicious intent or security risks.",
