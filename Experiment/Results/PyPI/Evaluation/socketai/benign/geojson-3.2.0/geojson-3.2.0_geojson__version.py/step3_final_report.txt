  "purpose": "Define a version string and convert it into a tuple of integers for comparison purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version string from a hardcoded variable __version__.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows are present; the code does not process external input or output data.",
  "flows": "The version string __version__ is split and converted into integers, then stored in __version_info__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static version string and converts it into a tuple of integers for easy comparison. It involves no external inputs, dynamic execution, or data leaks. The logic is standard and benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The code's simplicity and clarity suggest no vulnerabilities or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version handling snippet with no malicious or suspicious activity. All assessments and scores indicating no malware, no obfuscation, and no security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
