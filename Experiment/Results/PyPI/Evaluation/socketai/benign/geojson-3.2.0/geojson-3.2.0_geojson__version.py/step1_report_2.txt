{
  "purpose": "Define the package version as a string and convert it into a tuple of integers for version comparison or validation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version string __version__ and splits it into parts.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "The version string is split and mapped to integers to create __version_info__, but this is internal processing without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with standard version handling.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string __version__ and creates a tuple __version_info__ by splitting the string and converting each segment into an integer. There are no external input sources or data sinks. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior observed. The code is typical version handling code, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is simple version parsing logic with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It performs standard version string processing for package version management.",
