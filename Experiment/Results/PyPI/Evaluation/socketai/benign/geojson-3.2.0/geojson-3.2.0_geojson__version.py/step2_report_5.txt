  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully, focusing on the code's actual content, the reasoning provided, and the scoring.\n\n**Code Under Review:**\n```python\n__version__ = \"3.2.0\"\n__version_info__ = tuple(map(int, __version__.split(\".\")))\n```\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Defines a version string.\n- Converts it into a tuple of integers for comparison purposes.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code is straightforward, with no dynamic or external input.\n- No obfuscation, malicious activity, or suspicious behavior is evident.\n- The logic is standard for version handling.\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n#### Reports 1-5:\n- All correctly identify that the code is simple version assignment and parsing.\n- No external data sources, sinks, or flows are involved.\n- No anomalies, secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n- The reasoning is sound and aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n### Scores:\n- All reports assign:\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n- These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Critical observations:\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** Correctly 0, the code is clear.\n- **SecurityRisk:** Correctly 0, no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors.\n\n### Potential issues or inconsistencies:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No need to adjust any scores.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is benign, standard version handling.\n- The scores reflect the actual security posture accurately.\n- No further suspicion or risk is warranted.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. The code is safe, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
