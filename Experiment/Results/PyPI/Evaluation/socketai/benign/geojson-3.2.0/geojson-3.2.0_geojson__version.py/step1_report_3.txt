  "purpose": "Define the version of the package as a string and as a tuple of integers.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version string from the __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data processing or external output.",
  "flows": "The version string is split and mapped to integers to create __version_info__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard version parsing code.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string, then converts it into a tuple of integers for easier comparison. It does not process any input data, connect to external sources, or execute untrusted code. There are no suspicious behaviors or malicious patterns. This is a typical version handling snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward version parsing without malicious intent or security risks.",
