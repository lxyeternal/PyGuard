  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward version parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a string value to __version__, then creates a tuple __version_info__ by splitting this string into parts, converting each to an integer. This is a common practice for version handling. No external input, data leaks, or suspicious operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard version string parsing without any malicious intent or security risks.",
