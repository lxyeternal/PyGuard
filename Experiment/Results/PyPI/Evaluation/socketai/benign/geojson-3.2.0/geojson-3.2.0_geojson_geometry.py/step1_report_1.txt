  "purpose": "Define classes for handling GeoJSON geometries with validation and coordinate cleaning.",
  "sources": "Coordinate input data from initialization parameters and method calls.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data sinks such as network, file, or database operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input coordinates flow through validation and cleaning functions within class methods.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behavior are detected. The code uses standard libraries and straightforward validation logic.",
  "analysis": "The code provides GeoJSON geometry classes with coordinate validation, cleaning, and error reporting. It uses standard Python features and does not perform external data transmission, system modifications, or untrusted code execution. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident, and the code appears to be a typical implementation of GeoJSON validation routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard GeoJSON geometry handling module with validation logic. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It is well-structured and relies on common libraries. No indicators of malware or security vulnerabilities are present.",
