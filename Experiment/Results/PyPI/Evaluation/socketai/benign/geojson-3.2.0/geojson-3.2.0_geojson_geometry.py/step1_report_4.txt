{
  "purpose": "Defines classes for GeoJSON geometries and collections, including validation methods.",
  "sources": "Input coordinates and geometry data provided via class initializers or method calls.",
  "sinks": "Potentially problematic places include the use of 'round' on coordinate data, but no direct sinks for untrusted data processing or external system interaction are present.",
  "flows": "Coordinates flow from input to validation and cleaning functions, with no external data or system interactions involved.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'round' on coordinate data; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code; the code performs data validation without any obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for handling and validating GeoJSON geometries, including coordinate cleaning and error reporting. No external data sources, network operations, or system modifications are present. 'round' is used for coordinate precision adjustment, which is standard. No anomalies, malicious code, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of GeoJSON geometry validation with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It properly validates input data, ensuring GeoJSON compliance. No malware or security risks are identified.",
