{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes for GeoJSON geometries with validation, coordinate normalization, and error reporting, intended for geographic data handling.",
  "sources": "Input coordinates provided to geometry objects, accessed via self['coordinates']",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or data transmission points are present in the code",
  "flows": "Input coordinates are validated and potentially rounded; errors are collected; data flows from input through validation to internal storage",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with standard validation and rounding routines",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard GeoJSON geometry validation and normalization without external interactions or malicious behaviors. It uses common Python practices, with coordinate validation, error collection, and rounding for precision. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious intent is evident. The use of 'round()' is normal for coordinate normalization, and error handling is standard. The code is well-structured and clear, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), justified by the coordinate processing but not indicating any vulnerability or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of GeoJSON geometry validation routines. No malicious or security-threatening elements are present. The current scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
