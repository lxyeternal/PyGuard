  "purpose": "Define classes for handling GeoJSON geometries with validation and coordinate cleaning.",
  "sources": "Data inputs include 'coordinates' parameter during object instantiation, which can come from external sources or user input.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly evident; no output, network communication, or data storage actions present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through class constructors, validation methods, and coordinate cleaning functions without external untrusted data leading to system effects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors observed. The code performs data validation and coordinate normalization.",
  "analysis": "The code provides classes for GeoJSON geometries, with validation routines and coordinate cleaning functions that process input coordinate data. There is no evidence of data leakage, insecure data handling, or malicious activity. The methods are straightforward, validating input structures, and rounding coordinate values, which are normal operations. No network activity, system commands, or data exfiltration logic is present. Overall, the code appears to be a standard implementation for GeoJSON geometry validation and normalization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard geojson geometry handling module with validation routines. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It performs input validation and coordinate normalization as intended, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
