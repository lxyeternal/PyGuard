{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes for handling GeoJSON geometries, including validation and coordinate cleaning, primarily for geographic data processing.",
  "sources": "Coordinates input in constructors and methods like clean_coordinates, error methods, and data access via self['coordinates'].",
  "sinks": "Potential data leakage if coordinates or errors contain sensitive data, but no explicit data sinks such as network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (coordinates) is validated and processed through methods like clean_coordinates, then errors are checked, and coordinates are stored or returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code; the code strictly performs validation and formatting of geographic data. No obfuscated code or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The classes perform validation of geographic coordinate data, ensuring proper format, range, and structure. There are no operations involving network access, file handling, or system commands. The use of rounding for coordinate precision is standard, and error reporting is straightforward. The code is focused solely on data validation and formatting, with no signs of malicious intent or covert behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of GeoJSON geometry validation and formatting without any malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious code. No security issues are evident.",
