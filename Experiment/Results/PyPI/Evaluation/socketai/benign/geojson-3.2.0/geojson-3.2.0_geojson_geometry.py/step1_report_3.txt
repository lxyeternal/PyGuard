  "purpose": "Define classes for GeoJSON geometries with validation and coordinate cleaning.",
  "sources": "Initialization methods, coordinate validation functions, class methods for coordinate processing.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no untrusted data handling or network operations.",
  "flows": "Input coordinates -> validation and cleaning functions -> stored in class attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of GeoJSON geometry classes with validation logic for coordinate structures, including checking coordinate types, lengths, and linear ring properties. No dynamic code execution, external network calls, or obfuscated elements are present. All coordinate validation appears standard and intended for data integrity. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are detected; the code appears to be a straightforward implementation of geojson geometry validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of GeoJSON geometry classes with validation routines. No malicious or suspicious behavior identified. It performs coordinate validation and formatting for GeoJSON geometries without external interactions or hidden functionalities.",
