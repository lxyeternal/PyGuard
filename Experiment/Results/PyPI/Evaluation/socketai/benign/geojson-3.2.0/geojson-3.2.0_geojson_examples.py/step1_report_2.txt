  "purpose": "Defines a simple GIS feature class with a JSON decoder hook for creating instances from dictionaries.",
  "sources": "Input dictionary 'o' in create_simple_web_feature function, and constructor parameters in SimpleWebFeature.__init__.",
  "sinks": "None of the code explicitly writes to or reads from external systems, files, or network resources.",
  "flows": "Input dictionary 'o' flows through create_simple_web_feature to instantiate SimpleWebFeature, passing data from 'o' to the class attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. No malicious network activity or data leakage detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward data class for GIS features with a helper function to create instances from dictionaries. It performs standard attribute extraction with error handling. No insecure data handling, injection, or malicious behavior present. No external resource access, network calls, or security-sensitive operations identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard implementation for representing GIS features with a JSON decoder helper. It does not contain any malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
