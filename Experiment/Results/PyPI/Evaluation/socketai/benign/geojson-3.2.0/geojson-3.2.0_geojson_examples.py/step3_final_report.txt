  "purpose": "Data encapsulation and deserialization of GIS features for geo interface compliance.",
  "sources": "Input dictionaries in create_simple_web_feature() function, accessed via keys 'id', 'geometry', and 'properties'.",
  "sinks": "None; no external sinks or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input dict 'o' through key access to object instantiation; no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "None; standard data handling, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, and no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple data class for GIS features with a method to output a dict conforming to geo interface. The creation function safely constructs an object from a dict, with error handling that defaults to returning the original object if keys are missing or malformed. No external network, file, or dynamic code operations are present. The use of try-except is standard, and data conversions are normal. No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward data container and deserialization utility with no security issues or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent and justified given the code's simplicity and safety.",
