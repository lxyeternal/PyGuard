  "purpose": "Define a simple GIS feature class and a JSON decoder hook to create instances from dictionaries.",
  "sources": "Input dictionary 'o' in create_simple_web_feature function, class constructor parameters.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; data is used to instantiate objects and access dictionary fields.",
  "flows": "Dictionary 'o' -> create_simple_web_feature -> SimpleWebFeature instance",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated segments. The code performs standard data parsing and object creation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for geographic features with properties and a method to convert to dict for geo interface compliance. The create_simple_web_feature function safely extracts fields from a dictionary to instantiate the class, with exception handling for missing keys or type errors. There are no network calls, eval, exec, or external code execution. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious logic present. The code appears to be standard data structure handling for GIS features, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data handling utility for GIS features, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply processes dictionaries to create objects and provides a property for geo interface compliance.",
