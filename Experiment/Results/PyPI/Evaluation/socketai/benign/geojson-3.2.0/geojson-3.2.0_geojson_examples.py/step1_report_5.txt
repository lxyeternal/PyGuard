{
  "purpose": "Define a simple GIS feature class and a factory function to create instances from dicts, mainly for geo-data representation and decoding.",
  "sources": "Data read from the input dictionary 'o', specifically 'id', 'geometry', and 'properties' fields.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data is written to external systems, files, network, or environment variables.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input dictionary 'o' into the SimpleWebFeature constructor via the create_simple_web_feature function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. The code is straightforward, with standard data handling and object creation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple class for GIS features with properties and a method to serialize as a dict. The create_simple_web_feature function decodes a dict into an object, with basic error handling. No use of insecure functions, no hardcoded secrets, no malicious code, and no external data operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard data model and decoder utility for geographic features, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks.",
