  "purpose": "A utility class for representing, validating, and serializing GeoJSON objects, providing attribute access and type coercion.",
  "sources": "Parameters passed to __init__, external modules geojson and geojson.mapping, and internal method calls.",
  "sinks": "Serialization via geojson.dumps; no external data output, network activity, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through internal methods, with type coercion and validation, ending in serialization or attribute access.",
  "anomalies": "The __geo_interface__ property lacks a return statement if self.type != 'GeoJSON', which may lead to returning None, but this is not security-related.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward subclass of dict for GeoJSON data, with methods for attribute access, validation, and conversion. It relies on standard libraries and performs no malicious operations. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or external data flows are present. The __geo_interface__ property has a minor bug but no security implications. The type coercion in to_instance uses safe factory methods. Overall, the code is benign and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for GeoJSON data handling with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
