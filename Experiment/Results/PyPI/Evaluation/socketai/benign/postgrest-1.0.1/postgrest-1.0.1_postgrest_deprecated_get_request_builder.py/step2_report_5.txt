  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate the reports and the code snippet.\n\n**Code Review Summary:**\n- The code defines a class `GetRequestBuilder` that inherits from `AsyncSelectRequestBuilder`.\n- The constructor is marked as deprecated, with a warning to use `SelectRequestBuilder` instead.\n- The code imports modules from `__future__`, `deprecation`, and internal modules.\n- No data processing, external communication, or user input handling occurs.\n- The code serves as a backward compatibility alias with deprecation warnings.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**\n\n**Confirmed:**  \n- The code is straightforward, with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.  \n- No data flows from untrusted sources, nor are there any sinks that could process such data.\n\n**Not present:**  \n- Any malware, backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic**\n\n**Observation:**  \n- The reports uniformly describe the code as a deprecation alias for backward compatibility, with no suspicious behavior.  \n- They correctly identify the use of the `deprecated` decorator and the absence of data flows or external operations.\n\n**Potential critique:**  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate; no logical flaws are evident.  \n- They could mention that deprecation warnings are a normal part of API evolution, not an indicator of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \n- The scores seem appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**\n\n- The risk scores are all 0, which aligns with the findings.  \n- The code is purely structural, with no external dependencies or data handling that could pose security threats.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Malware Score Consideration**\n\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.  \n- No malicious behavior, such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration, is evident.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**\n\n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as a deprecation wrapper.  \n- No suspicious assumptions are present.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Consistency of Scores with the Report**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis provided.  \n- No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment & Final Scores**\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard deprecation alias, serving backward compatibility, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Remarks**\n\n- The code is benign and does not pose any security threat.\n- The deprecation warnings are typical for API evolution and do not indicate malicious intent.\n- The reports are accurate and appropriately cautious.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis assessment aligns with the provided analysis and the code's nature.",
