  "purpose": "Define a deprecated alias class for AsyncSelectRequestBuilder with a deprecation warning.",
  "sources": "Import statements for deprecation, AsyncSelectRequestBuilder, and version information.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code mainly sets up class inheritance and deprecation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated decorator; no suspicious or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a class GetRequestBuilder that inherits from AsyncSelectRequestBuilder. The constructor is marked as deprecated, indicating an intention to phase out this alias in favor of another. There are no data inputs, outputs, or external communication; the code's purpose is purely structural. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or obfuscated elements are present. The deprecation warning suggests planned code evolution rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward class alias with a deprecation notice. No malicious or security issues are evident. The code is standard, focusing on backward compatibility without any suspicious activity.",
