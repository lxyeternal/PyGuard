  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external data outputs.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows from sources to sinks in this code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated decorator; no malicious or suspicious code present; no hardcoded secrets or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules, defines a subclass with a deprecated constructor, and provides an alias. No user input, external data handling, or network operations occur. The deprecated decorator indicates planned API evolution but not malicious intent. Overall, the code appears straightforward and non-malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard class alias with deprecation warnings; it contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It simply facilitates API changes with no suspicious or harmful elements.",
