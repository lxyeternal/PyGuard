  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Functionality & Logic**:\n   - The code defines a class `GetRequestBuilder` that inherits from `AsyncSelectRequestBuilder`.\n   - The constructor is marked as deprecated, signaling a transition plan.\n   - All reports agree that the code's purpose is to maintain backward compatibility via a deprecated alias.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, external communications, or processing of untrusted data.\n   - The imports are standard, and the use of the `deprecated` decorator is typical for API evolution.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:\n   - No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no unusual language features or hidden behaviors.\n\n3. **Scores & Reasoning**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign a score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n   - **Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, which is reasonable given the code's benign nature.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions**:\n   - The only notable aspect is the deprecation decorator, which indicates an API change but does not introduce security risks.\n   - No claims or evidence suggest the code performs any harmful operations.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment**:\n\n- The code is a simple, well-understood pattern for deprecating and aliasing classes.\n- There are no vulnerabilities, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation present.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion**: The reports are accurate, and the code is benign. No adjustments to scores are necessary.",
