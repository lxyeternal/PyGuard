  "purpose": "Define a deprecated alias class for AsyncSelectRequestBuilder with a deprecation warning.",
  "sources": "Import statements from __future__, deprecation module, local modules (_async.request_builder and version).",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or output to external systems.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecation decorator indicates transitional code, but no suspicious behavior or hidden code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports modules, defines a subclass that serves as an alias with a deprecation warning. No input handling, no output, no data manipulation, no suspicious or malicious behavior observed. The deprecation decorator indicates the code is intended for backward compatibility. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard deprecation alias implementation for backward compatibility, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
