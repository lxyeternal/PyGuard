{
  "purpose": "Define a deprecated alias class for AsyncSelectRequestBuilder with version deprecation warning.",
  "sources": "Import statements from __future__, deprecation module, internal modules _async.request_builder and version.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data input/output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; constructor only calls superclass.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated decorator; no other unusual or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features for compatibility, a deprecation module, and internal modules. It defines a class GetRequestBuilder that inherits from AsyncSelectRequestBuilder, serving as an alias with a deprecation warning for version updates. The constructor merely calls the superclass constructor. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The only notable aspect is the deprecation decorator indicating planned removal or change in future versions.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a simple alias with deprecation warning; no malicious intent or security risks are evident. It appears to be standard, harmless code intended for backward compatibility.",
