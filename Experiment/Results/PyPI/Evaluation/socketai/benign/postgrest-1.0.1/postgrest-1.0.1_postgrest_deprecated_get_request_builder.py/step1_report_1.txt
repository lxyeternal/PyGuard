{
  "purpose": "This code defines a class alias for AsyncSelectRequestBuilder, with a deprecated constructor, to maintain backward compatibility.",
  "sources": "Imports from deprecation module, relative import of AsyncSelectRequestBuilder, import of __version__, and the class constructor",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or perform security-sensitive operations",
  "flows": "The constructor calls the superclass constructor; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks identified",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated decorator indicating version management, no suspicious or malicious code present",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up a deprecated alias class that inherits from an async request builder. It imports necessary modules and applies a deprecation warning on the constructor. There are no evident input handling, data processing, or external communications that could introduce security risks. The code is straightforward, with no unusual language features or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard deprecation wrapper for backward compatibility. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected based on this snippet.",
