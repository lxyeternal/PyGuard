  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code snippet and the reports carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code defines a class `GetRequestBuilder` inheriting from `AsyncSelectRequestBuilder`.\n- The constructor is marked as deprecated, with a warning indicating a version change.\n- Imports include `__future__` features, a deprecation module, and internal modules.\n- The code appears to serve as a backward compatibility alias with no data processing, external communication, or input handling.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Confirm if issues are present\n- The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or handle sensitive information.\n- No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are evident.\n- The deprecation decorator is standard practice for phased API changes.\n\n**Conclusion:** There are no security issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors in this code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes\n- The code is straightforward and well-structured.\n- The use of deprecation is appropriate and standard.\n- No logical errors or suspicious constructs are present.\n- No evidence of obfuscation or hidden malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:** No errors or flaws detected.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Review scores assigned to each report\n- All reports assign:\n  - Purpose: Clarifies code's role as a deprecation alias.\n  - Sources and sinks: None involve untrusted data or external communication.\n  - Anomalies: Only the deprecation decorator, which is standard.\n  - Malware score: 0 in all cases.\n  - Security risk: 0 in all cases.\n  - Confidence: 1, indicating high certainty.\n\n**Assessment:** The scores seem appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5\n- The highest risk here is the use of deprecation, which is a standard practice, not a security threat.\n- No data flow, no external inputs, no code injection, or malicious logic.\n- Therefore, the risk score should remain at 0.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Malware score considerations\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports.\n- No malicious activity is suggested or implied.\n- The code does not perform any suspicious operations.\n\n**Conclusion:** Malware score is correctly assigned as 0.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities\n- All reports assume the code is benign based on static analysis.\n- No assumptions about hidden malicious code are made; the analysis is consistent with the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Consistency of scores\n- All scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n- No discrepancies noted.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### Personal estimate:\nGiven the analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a benign, standard deprecation alias used for backward compatibility, with no malicious or security issues.",
