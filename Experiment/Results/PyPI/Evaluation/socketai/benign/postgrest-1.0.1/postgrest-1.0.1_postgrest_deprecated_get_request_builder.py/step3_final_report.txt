{
  "purpose": "The code provides a backward compatibility alias class 'GetRequestBuilder' inheriting from 'AsyncSelectRequestBuilder', with a deprecated constructor to signal API transition.",
  "sources": "The class constructor and import statements, notably the deprecated decorator and internal module imports.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external communication points are present; the code does not process or transmit data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely defines a class alias with a deprecated constructor.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class alias with a deprecated constructor, serving as a transitional API element. It imports standard modules, applies a deprecation decorator, and inherits from a base class. No data input, external communication, or security-sensitive operations are involved. The deprecation decorator is a common pattern for API evolution, not a security concern. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions indicate no malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a backward compatibility wrapper with no malicious behavior or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
