  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues. It serves as a typical error handling utility. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate. The slight security risk score of 0.1 in one report is unjustified and should be lowered to 0. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and correctness."
