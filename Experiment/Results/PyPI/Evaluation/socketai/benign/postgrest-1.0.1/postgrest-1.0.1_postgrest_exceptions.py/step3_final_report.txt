  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class 'APIError' for encapsulating API error details and a function to generate default error messages from HTTP responses.",
  "sources": "Error dictionary passed to 'APIError' constructor; HTTP response object in 'generate_default_error_message'.",
  "sinks": "Error data stored and retrieved within class methods; no external or untrusted data execution.",
  "flows": "Error dictionary from external source flows into 'APIError' instance; error message generated from HTTP response flows into error dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of error handling, encapsulating error details in a class and generating error messages from HTTP responses. It does not perform any malicious actions, code injection, or data exfiltration. Data flows are limited to error reporting, with no external or untrusted code execution. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present. The code is well-structured, straightforward, and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues. It serves as a typical error handling utility. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate. The slight security risk score of 0.1 in one report is unjustified and should be lowered to 0. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and correctness.",
