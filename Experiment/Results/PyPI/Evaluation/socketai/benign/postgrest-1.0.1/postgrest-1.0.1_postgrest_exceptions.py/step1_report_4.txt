{
  "purpose": "Define a custom APIError exception class for handling API error responses and a function to generate default error messages.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a dictionary in the __init__ method of APIError and from the response object 'r' in generate_default_error_message.",
  "sinks": "The code converts data to string representations and returns raw error dictionaries. No sinks process untrusted data beyond formatting or returning error info.",
  "flows": "Error data is read from the input dictionary and response object, then formatted into strings or dictionaries for reporting.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code structure is straightforward, with clear exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class that captures error details from a provided dictionary, formats error messages, and outputs raw error data. The generate_default_error_message function creates a dictionary with error info from an HTTP response object. All data handling involves formatting or returning data; there is no indication of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code appears to serve as a standard error handling utility with no suspicious logic or external data flows that could be exploited.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious implementation of error handling and message generation for API responses. No malicious intent or security risks are detected.",
