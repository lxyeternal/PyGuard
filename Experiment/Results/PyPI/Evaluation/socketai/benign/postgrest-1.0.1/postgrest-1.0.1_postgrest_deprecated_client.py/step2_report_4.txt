  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall code review:**\n\n- The code defines a class `Client` as a subclass of `AsyncPostgrestClient`, with a deprecation decorator on its constructor, issuing a warning about transitioning to `PostgrestClient`.\n- It then assigns `PostgrestClient = Client`, effectively creating an alias.\n- The code imports from internal modules, uses a deprecation warning, but does not perform any data processing, network activity, or handle untrusted inputs.\n- No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are present.\n- The purpose is clearly for backward compatibility during API evolution.\n\n---\n\n### Issue-by-issue review:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Purpose:** Benign alias with deprecation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.9\n- **Analysis:** The report assigns a high security risk score (0.9) despite no actual security issues. Since the code only defines classes and issues a deprecation warning, this is an overestimation.\n- **Recommendation:** The security risk score should be lowered to 0, as there's no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n#### Report 2:\n- **Purpose:** Standard deprecation alias.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.9\n- **Analysis:** Same as above, high security risk score is unjustified.\n- **Recommendation:** Reduce to 0.\n\n#### Report 3:\n- **Purpose:** Alias with deprecation warning.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=1\n- **Analysis:** The security risk score is at maximum (1), which is inappropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Recommendation:** Lower to 0.\n\n#### Report 4:\n- **Purpose:** Backward compatibility alias.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Analysis:** Slightly higher than zero, but still very low. Given the code's benign nature, this seems reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Acceptable, no change needed.\n\n#### Report 5:\n- **Purpose:** Standard aliasing.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Analysis:** Correctly assessed as safe.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Malware score:\n- All reports have malware=0, which is correct; no malicious code is present.\n\n### Obfuscated score:\n- All reports have obfuscated=0, which is correct.\n\n### Final risk assessment:\n- The core issue is the overestimation of the security risk in reports 1-3.\n- The code itself is straightforward, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of recommended scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Security risk:** Should be 0 for reports 1-3; 0.1 or 0 for reports 4-5 is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Final notes:\n- The code is a simple class alias with deprecation warnings, a common pattern in library maintenance.\n- No malicious activity, data leaks, or vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The high security risk scores in some reports are unjustified and should be corrected.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, I recommend adjusting the security risk scores for reports 1-3 to 0, aligning with the benign nature of the code. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set at 0. The code does not pose any security threat or malicious intent.",
