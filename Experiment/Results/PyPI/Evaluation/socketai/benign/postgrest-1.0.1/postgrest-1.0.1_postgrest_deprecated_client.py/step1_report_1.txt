{
  "purpose": "This code defines a deprecated alias class for an asynchronous PostgREST client, primarily for backward compatibility.",
  "sources": "The code imports from __future__, deprecation module, local modules '_async.client' and 'version'. No user input or external data is read.",
  "sinks": "There are no sink points where untrusted data could cause data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "The class constructor calls the superclass constructor, with no data flow involving untrusted input or output.",
  "anomalies": "The use of the deprecation decorator indicates intent to phase out the class. No other anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a subclass 'Client' with a deprecation warning, and assigns this class to 'PostgrestClient' as an alias. No external data input, no sensitive operations, and no malicious behavior are observed. The deprecated decorator is used appropriately, indicating a transition plan rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, benign alias with proper deprecation handling. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
