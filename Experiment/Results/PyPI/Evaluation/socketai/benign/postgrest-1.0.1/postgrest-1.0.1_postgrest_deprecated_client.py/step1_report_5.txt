{
  "purpose": "Define a deprecated alias class for an asynchronous PostgREST client, providing backward compatibility.",
  "sources": "Import statements for deprecation handling, the async client, and version information.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code mainly sets up class inheritance and deprecation warnings.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated decorator, straightforward class aliasing, no embedded or obfuscated code, no hardcoded credentials or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a class 'Client' that inherits from 'AsyncPostgrestClient', and marks its constructor as deprecated in favor of 'PostgrestClient'. The deprecation decorator issues a warning when the constructor is called. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious activities. The overall structure is typical for maintaining backward compatibility with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, benign class alias with a deprecation warning. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
