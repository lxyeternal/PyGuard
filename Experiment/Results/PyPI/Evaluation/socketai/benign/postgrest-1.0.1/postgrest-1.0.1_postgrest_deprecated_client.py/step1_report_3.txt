{
  "purpose": "Defines a Client class as an alias to AsyncPostgrestClient with a deprecation warning for the __init__ method, and assigns it to PostgrestClient.",
  "sources": "Imports from deprecation module, internal module '_async.client', and version information.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data is written to external sources or network in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines classes and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a subclass 'Client' which is an alias to 'AsyncPostgrestClient', and marks its constructor as deprecated. It also creates an alias 'PostgrestClient'. The use of the 'deprecated' decorator is standard for signaling deprecation. No inputs, outputs, or data manipulation is present that could lead to malicious activity. No external network or file access occurs here. Overall, this code appears to be a straightforward, standard aliasing pattern with deprecation warnings.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign class aliasing with deprecation handling, without any signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
