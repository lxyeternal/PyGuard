{
  "purpose": "Define a deprecated alias class for AsyncPostgrestClient with versioning info.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class constructor, deprecated decorator.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no data leaks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No significant data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; mainly class inheritance and deprecation notification.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated decorator and class aliasing are standard; no unusual code or hardcoded secrets observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules, defines a class 'Client' inheriting from 'AsyncPostgrestClient', and marks its constructor as deprecated with a version warning. It then creates an alias 'PostgrestClient'. No input handling, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are present. The use of deprecation warnings is typical for library maintenance. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard class alias with a deprecation warning; no malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It appears to be a harmless part of library versioning and API evolution.",
