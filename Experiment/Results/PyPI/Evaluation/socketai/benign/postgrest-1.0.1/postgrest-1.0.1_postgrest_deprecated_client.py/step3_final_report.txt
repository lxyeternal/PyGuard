{
  "purpose": "The code defines a subclass 'Client' inheriting from 'AsyncPostgrestClient' with a deprecation warning on its constructor, and creates an alias 'PostgrestClient' for backward compatibility.",
  "sources": "The class constructor (__init__), the import statements, and the deprecation decorator usage.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, network activity, or external input processing present; thus, no sinks are identified.",
  "flows": "The constructor calls 'super().__init__()', which may invoke parent class initialization, but no malicious or insecure data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic execution are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class alias with a deprecation warning, serving as a backward compatibility measure. It does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain obfuscated or malicious code. The use of the 'deprecated' decorator is standard for signaling deprecation. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities are present. The class inheritance and constructor calls are typical and do not indicate malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. It serves as a benign backward compatibility alias with a deprecation warning. The scores should be malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0, reflecting its harmless and standard nature.",
