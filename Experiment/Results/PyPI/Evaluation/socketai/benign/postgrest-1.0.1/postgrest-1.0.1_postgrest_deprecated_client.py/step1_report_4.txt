{
  "purpose": "Define a deprecated alias class for AsyncPostgrestClient with versioning and deprecation warnings.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class constructor, and decorator indicating deprecation.",
  "sinks": "Potential usage of super().__init__ which might initialize network connections or handle credentials.",
  "flows": "Input arguments to __init__ are passed directly to the superclass; deprecation message triggers during instantiation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecation decorator; no hardcoded secrets, suspicious commands, or malicious code. No input/output handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily establishes an alias class 'Client' inheriting from 'AsyncPostgrestClient' with a deprecation warning indicating to use 'PostgrestClient' instead. The import statements and class definition are standard. The deprecation decorator issues a warning when the class is instantiated, but no malicious behavior is evident. The code does not perform any data leaks, network activity, or unsafe operations beyond normal class inheritance and deprecation handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a backward-compatible alias with deprecation warning. No malicious intent or security risks are evident. It appears safe, with no evidence of malicious or suspicious activity.",
