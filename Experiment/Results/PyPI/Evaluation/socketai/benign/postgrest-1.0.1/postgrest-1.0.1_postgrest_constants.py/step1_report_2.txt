  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or user input handling present",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static configuration data only",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a dictionary with standard HTTP headers for JSON communication and a timeout value. There are no dynamic or user-supplied inputs, no code injection points, and no network activity or data leaks. The code appears to be straightforward configuration with no malicious intent or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple configuration setup for HTTP request headers and timeout, with no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
