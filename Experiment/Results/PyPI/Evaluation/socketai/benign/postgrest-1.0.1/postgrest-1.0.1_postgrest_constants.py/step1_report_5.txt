  "purpose": "Define default HTTP headers and timeout settings for a PostgREST client",
  "sources": "Assignment of static dictionary and integer value as constants",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or user inputs are used",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; static configuration only",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and static",
  "analysis": "The code declares two constants: one a dictionary with fixed HTTP headers indicating JSON content, and another an integer representing a timeout value. There are no dynamic inputs, user data, or code execution paths. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The code appears to be standard configuration without any obfuscation or hidden logic.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple configuration snippet setting default headers and timeout values for a PostgREST client. There is no indication of malicious intent, security risks, or anomalies.",
