  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Presence and Content**:  \n   All reports describe the same code snippet, which consists of static assignments:\n   ```python\n   DEFAULT_POSTGREST_CLIENT_HEADERS = {\n       \"Accept\": \"application/json\",\n       \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",\n   }\n\n   DEFAULT_POSTGREST_CLIENT_TIMEOUT = 120\n   ```\n   The code is straightforward, with no dynamic behavior, user input, or external data sources.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. They correctly identify that the code is static configuration with no malicious activity, data leaks, or security issues.  \n   - No logical errors or flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:  \n   - All reports assign `malware` and `securityRisk` scores of 0, which is appropriate given the static, benign nature of the code.  \n   - The `obfuscated` score is 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.  \n   - The `confidence` score is 1, reflecting certainty in the assessment, which is justified.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores**:  \n   - Since all reports correctly identify the code as benign and static, there's no need to justify higher risk scores.  \n   - The risk scores of 0 are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**:  \n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions—no code injection, backdoors, or malicious network activity.  \n   - The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   - The reports avoid assumptions and rely on concrete static analysis.  \n   - No unwarranted claims are present.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   - The scores are consistent across reports and aligned with the analysis.\n\n**Overall Conclusion**:  \n- The code is a simple, static configuration snippet with no malicious or security concerns.  \n- The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.\n\n**My own estimates** for the scores:\n- **Malware**: 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated**: 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final assessment**: The code is safe, and the reports correctly reflect that. No changes are necessary.",
