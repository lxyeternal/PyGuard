  "purpose": "Static configuration for HTTP headers and timeout settings in a Python application.",
  "sources": "Assignment of static dictionary 'DEFAULT_POSTGREST_CLIENT_HEADERS' and integer 'DEFAULT_POSTGREST_CLIENT_TIMEOUT'. No external data or user input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows; the code does not process or output external data.",
  "flows": "None; static assignments without data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, static, and free of suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static assignments defining HTTP headers and a timeout value. There are no dynamic behaviors, external inputs, or code execution. All reports correctly identify this as benign configuration code. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the static, non-malicious nature of the code. No evidence of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks is present. The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or contain hidden backdoors. Given the simplicity and static nature, the code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static configuration snippet with no malicious or security concerns. All reports accurately reflect this, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
