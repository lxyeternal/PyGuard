  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:\n   - The original code is a static assignment of a dictionary (`DEFAULT_POSTGREST_CLIENT_HEADERS`) and an integer (`DEFAULT_POSTGREST_CLIENT_TIMEOUT`). All reports accurately describe this static configuration.\n   - There are no signs of dynamic data, user input, external sources, or code execution.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and correctly identify that the code is static, straightforward, and free of malicious activity.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident in the summaries.\n   - The assessments correctly note the absence of vulnerabilities, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - All reports assign `malware` = 0, `obfuscated` = 0, and `securityRisk` = 0, which aligns with the static, benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence score is 1 across all reports, which is appropriate given the straightforward analysis.\n   - No adjustments are necessary based on the evidence.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:\n   - Since the code is purely static configuration with no external inputs, no dynamic behavior, and no suspicious patterns, a risk score higher than 0.0 is unwarranted.\n   - All reports correctly assign a `securityRisk` of 0.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:\n   - The malware score is 0 in all reports, which is correct.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, such as executing code, exfiltrating data, or including malicious payloads.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they do not suggest vulnerabilities that aren't supported by the static code.\n   - Their reasoning is sound and based on observable facts.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Final Evaluation and Personal Estimate**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — no malicious activity present.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score**: 0 — no security risk detected.\n\n**Summary**:\nAll reports correctly identify that this is a benign, static configuration snippet with no security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThis code snippet is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The analysis and scoring are accurate.",
