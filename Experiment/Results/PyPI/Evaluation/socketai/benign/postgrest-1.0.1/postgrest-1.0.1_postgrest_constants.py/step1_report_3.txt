  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward constant definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code sets static default headers and a timeout value for HTTP requests. There are no dynamic inputs, no code execution, and no sensitive data handling. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation are evident. The code appears to be a standard configuration snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign configuration with no malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
