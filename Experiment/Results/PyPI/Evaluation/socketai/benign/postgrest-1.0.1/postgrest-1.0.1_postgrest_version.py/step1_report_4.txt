  "anomalies": "Presence of a comment indicating version control, but no anomalies in the code itself",
  "analysis": "This code assigns a string representing the version '1.0.1' to the variable __version__. It is a common practice in Python packaging to specify the version this way. There are no input sources, data flows, or suspicious code constructs present. The comment appears to be a placeholder for automated versioning tools and does not introduce any malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version assignment with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
