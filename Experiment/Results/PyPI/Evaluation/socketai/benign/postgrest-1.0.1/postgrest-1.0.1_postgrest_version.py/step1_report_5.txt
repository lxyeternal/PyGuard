  "analysis": "The code only assigns a static string to the __version__ variable and includes a comment indicating versioning metadata. No input/output, data handling, or malicious behavior is evident. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code detected. The comment is standard practice in version-controlled projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version assignment with an annotation comment. It shows no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
