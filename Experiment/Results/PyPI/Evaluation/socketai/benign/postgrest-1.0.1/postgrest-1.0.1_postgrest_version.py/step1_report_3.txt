  "purpose": "Defines the version of the package or module.",

  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data or external output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; simple assignment statement.",
  "anomalies": "Comment referencing 'x-release-please-version' may indicate version management tooling, but no malicious activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a string value '1.0.1' to the __version__ variable, which is a common practice for versioning Python packages. The comment suggests it is managed or injected by a release process (possibly release-please). There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security issues. The code is minimal and standard.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward version assignment with a comment indicating release management. No malicious behavior or security concerns are detected.",
