{
  "purpose": "Define enumerations for different methods and filters used in an application, likely for API or query handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements reading Python version info and optional strenum library, class definitions setting string constants.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or external inputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input to vulnerable sinks are identified.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import based on Python version appears normal; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines enumerations for methods and filters, using standard Python practices. It includes a conditional import based on the Python version, which is a common pattern for maintaining compatibility. There are no indications of dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior. The enumerations are straightforward, representing typical API request methods, filter operators, and return formats. No external data sources, sinks, or suspicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard enumeration setup for an API or query system with no malicious or security-threatening behavior identified. It appears benign and purely structural.",
