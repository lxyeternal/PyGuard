  "purpose": "Define enumerations for various constants used in request handling, filtering, and counting methods.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; all data comes from imported modules and class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; primarily static definitions of enums.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import of 'StrEnum' based on Python version, which is normal. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules conditionally and defines several Enum classes to standardize method and filter names. No dynamic code execution, external data handling, or suspicious logic observed. It appears to be a straightforward definition of constants for API request and filter types. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of enumeration definitions intended for use in a larger application. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and poses no security risks.",
