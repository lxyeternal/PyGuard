{
  "purpose": "Defines enumerations for various methods and filters used in an application, likely related to API or query handling.",
  "sources": "No external input sources or data reads are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data flows into sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks since no data input or processing occurs within this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically imports 'StrEnum' for Python >= 3.11 or from an external 'strenum' package for earlier versions. The use of conditional imports is standard; no malicious behavior is evident. No obfuscation or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides enumeration classes for different purposes: count methods, filters, request methods, and return methods. These are simple, static definitions. The conditional import for 'StrEnum' based on Python version is a common compatibility pattern. There are no inputs, outputs, or data processing routines that could be exploited. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of enumeration classes for application configuration or API interaction purposes. No malicious intent or security risks are detected.",
