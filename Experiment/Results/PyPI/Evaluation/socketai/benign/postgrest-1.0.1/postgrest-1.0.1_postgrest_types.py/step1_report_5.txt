{
  "purpose": "Define string enumeration classes for various filtering, request, and return methods, with compatibility for Python versions below 3.11.",
  "sources": "Import statements from __future__, sys module, conditional import of StrEnum or strenum based on Python version",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the code only defines enums and imports, with no data processing or network operations",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow or untrusted data handling present",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import to support multiple Python versions is standard; no unusual or suspicious code structures observed",
  "analysis": "The code primarily establishes enum classes for application logic. It uses conditional imports to ensure compatibility across Python versions. No input/output, network, or file operations are present. The enum values are straightforward string mappings. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. The code is minimal and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard and benign definition of enum classes for filtering and request methods with version compatibility handling. There are no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
