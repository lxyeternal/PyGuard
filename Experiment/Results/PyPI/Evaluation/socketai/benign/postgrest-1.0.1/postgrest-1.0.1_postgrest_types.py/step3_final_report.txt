{
  "purpose": "Defines enumeration classes for count methods, filters, request methods, and return methods used in API or query configurations.",
  "sources": "Static class definitions with string constants; conditional import for StrEnum based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "None; no data flows or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward enum definitions with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is static, simple, and serves as configuration constants. It uses standard practices for compatibility across Python versions. No external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution is involved. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The conditional import pattern is common and safe. Overall, the code is benign and poses no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static set of enum definitions for API parameters, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
