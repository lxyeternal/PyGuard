  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report:\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n\n- The code defines several enumeration classes (`CountMethod`, `Filters`, `RequestMethod`, `ReturnMethod`) using `StrEnum` or a fallback `strenum` for compatibility.\n- The conditional import pattern is standard practice.\n- The classes are static, containing string constants for API or query parameters.\n- No input/output, data processing, or external data handling is present.\n- No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are present.\n\n**Security implications:**\n\n- The code appears purely structural, serving as a set of constants/enums.\n- No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.\n- No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detectable.\n\n**Scores and reasoning:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — No malicious behavior or code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — Code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — No security risk detected.\n\n**Any points of contention or potential adjustments?**\n\n- The report assigns a risk score of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The malware score of 0 is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- The reasoning provided in all reports is consistent and sound.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n- The code is benign, with no security concerns.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate.\n- The analysis is thorough and justified.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions.
