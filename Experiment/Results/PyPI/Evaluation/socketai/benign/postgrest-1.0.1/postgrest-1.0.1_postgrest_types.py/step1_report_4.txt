  "purpose": "Define string-based enumerations for various methods and filters used in a larger application or API.",
  "sources": "No input sources; code is defining classes and constants.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or external output occurs in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward class definitions. The conditional import of StrEnum based on Python version is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and conditionally defines StrEnum depending on Python version. It then defines multiple enumeration classes for count methods, filters, request methods, and return methods, each containing string constants. No user input, data processing, or external calls are present. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as code injection, data leakage, or backdoors is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of enumeration class definitions used for API or application logic. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks in this code segment.",
