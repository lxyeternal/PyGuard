  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, the scores, and the underlying logic.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources**: The code is a utility for API request construction and response parsing. Inputs are function arguments, class properties, and response data.\n- **Sinks & Flows**: Potential sinks include JSON responses, headers, and query parameters, which could be manipulated if untrusted.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis**: No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors. Use of json.dumps and string formatting is standard. Validation prevents API errors from being misinterpreted.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence**: The code appears benign, with a high confidence level (0.9). No malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Scores**:  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Risk: 0.2 (low, given it's an API client library)\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing request building, response parsing, and sanitization.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion**: Also appears legitimate, with no malicious intent or suspicious patterns.  \n- **Scores**:  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.2\n\n**Scores seem reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- Focuses on request construction, response parsing, and input sanitization.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion**: No signs of malicious behavior, no backdoors, no obfuscation.  \n- **Scores**:  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.1 (very low, as expected for a client library)\n\n**Scores are consistent.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- Similar to above, with emphasis on safe query building and response handling.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion**: No malicious activity detected, standard practices employed.  \n- **Scores**:  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.2\n\n**Scores are appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- Focuses on potential untrusted input in query construction, but no malicious behavior is evident.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion**: The code is a typical API client, with no signs of malicious intent.  \n- **Scores**:  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.2\n\n**Scores are consistent.**\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious code are present.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, matching the code's straightforward structure.\n- **Risk Score**: Slightly above 0, but justified given the code's role in constructing queries and parsing responses. The low scores (0.1-0.2) are appropriate.\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware**: 0 (no signs of malware)\n- **Obfuscated**: 0 (clear, standard code)\n- **Risk**: 0.1-0.2 (minimal, inherent to API client code, no dangerous patterns)\n\n---\n\n### Final conclusion:\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured API client library with no malicious or obfuscated components. The scores reflect the low risk and benign nature of the code.\n\n**Summary**:  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1–0.2\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
