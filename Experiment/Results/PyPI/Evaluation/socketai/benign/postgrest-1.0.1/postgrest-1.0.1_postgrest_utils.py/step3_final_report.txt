{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for URL validation, JWT structure checking, parameter sanitization, and a minimal HTTPX client wrapper.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions (e.g., url, value, pattern, param), class method calls",
  "sinks": "None; functions perform validation or sanitization without executing untrusted code or transmitting data",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through validation functions; no data exfiltration or unsafe operations occur",
  "anomalies": "Unused imports (`httpx`), superficial JWT validation, no actual cryptographic verification, no obfuscated code or malicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of benign utility functions performing standard validation and sanitization tasks. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The JWT validation only checks structure, not signature, which is typical for such utilities. The HTTPX client wrapper is harmless. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are detected. The code's behavior aligns with safe, utility purposes. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, low security risk) are consistent with this benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The utility functions are straightforward and safe. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.",
