  "purpose": "Utility functions and classes for URL validation, string sanitization, type handling, and HTTP client abstraction.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include function parameters such as 'param', 'pattern', and 'url'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are string operations and regex matches, especially in 'sanitize_param', 'sanitize_pattern_param', and 'is_valid_jwt'.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through sanitization or validation functions, and into regex matching or URL parsing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or hidden malicious code detected. The code performs standard utility functions. The 'is_valid_jwt' function correctly validates token structure without parsing payloads. No suspicious network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for URL validation, string sanitization, and type handling. 'sanitize_param' encloses strings containing reserved characters in quotes, which is safe. 'sanitize_pattern_param' modifies patterns but does not perform unsafe operations. 'is_http_url' correctly identifies HTTP/HTTPS URLs using 'urlparse'. 'is_valid_jwt' checks for JWT format by verifying the presence of two dots and base64 URL-safe parts, which is standard for basic validation. The HTTPX client classes are simple wrappers with no network activity embedded. Overall, the code appears to perform benign utility functions without malicious intent or risky behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of harmless utility functions and simple class wrappers for HTTP clients. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity detected. The functions are standard, safe, and do not pose security risks.",
