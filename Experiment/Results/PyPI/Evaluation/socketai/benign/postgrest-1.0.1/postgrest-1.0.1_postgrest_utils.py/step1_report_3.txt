{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions and classes for HTTP client interactions, URL validation, JWT validation, and parameter sanitization.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input parameters in functions such as sanitize_param, sanitize_pattern_param, is_http_url, and is_valid_jwt.",
  "sinks": "The code does not directly write to external systems or perform dangerous operations. The functions sanitize input for safer usage but do not execute or transmit data.",
  "flows": "Input data from function parameters (e.g., URL strings, JWT strings) are processed through validation functions. There are no evident flows leading to external data transmission or execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected. The regex and validation functions are straightforward. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for sanitizing parameters, checking URL schemes, and validating JWT tokens. The class SyncClient wraps a standard HTTPX client with minimal modifications. The functions are mainly for input validation and sanitization, with no indications of malicious behavior. No suspicious external network calls, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The code appears to be part of a larger application providing safe HTTP client operations and input validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It implements standard utility functions and a minimal wrapper around an HTTP client. No signs of malware or suspicious activity.",
