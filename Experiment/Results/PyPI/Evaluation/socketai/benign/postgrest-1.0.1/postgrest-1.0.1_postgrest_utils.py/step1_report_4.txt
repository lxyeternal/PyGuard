{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions and classes for HTTP client management, parameter sanitization, URL validation, and JWT validation.",
  "sources": "Inputs include function parameters such as 'param', 'pattern', and 'url', as well as string inputs for JWT validation.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include URL parsing, regex matching, and string manipulations; no direct data leaks or system modifications are evident.",
  "flows": "Inputs like URL and JWT strings are processed through validation functions; sanitized parameters are returned but not used further in malicious contexts.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The regex and string operations are standard. Import statements include unused imports but that does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs data validation and sanitization. 'is_valid_jwt' correctly checks JWT format without decoding or verifying signatures, minimizing risk of misuse. The URL validation is basic but correct. No suspicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors is detected. The presence of the unused imports 'httpx' may suggest incomplete implementation but is not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility module focused on validation and sanitization tasks. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The code follows standard practices and does not contain obfuscated or suspicious logic.",
