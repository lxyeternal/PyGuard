{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions and classes for HTTP client interactions, URL validation, and JWT validation.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include function parameters such as 'param', 'pattern', 'url', and 'value'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are the URL validation function 'is_http_url' and JWT validation 'is_valid_jwt' which process untrusted input. No data is written or sent directly to external systems in this code.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (from external sources) are processed by 'sanitize_param' and 'sanitize_pattern_param' to sanitize inputs; URLs are validated in 'is_http_url'; JWT tokens are validated in 'is_valid_jwt'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. The code uses standard libraries and safe patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The regex for BASE64URL appears standard for JWT parts.",
  "analysis": "The code defines helper functions for sanitization, type handling, URL validation, and JWT validation. Functions perform straightforward checks and string manipulations without executing or handling untrusted code dynamically. 'sanitize_param' encloses parameters with reserved characters in quotes, which is typical sanitization. 'is_valid_jwt' correctly verifies the structure of a JWT token without decoding payloads. No external network calls, file operations, or command executions are present. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of utility functions for safe handling and validation of URLs and JWT tokens. It does not contain any malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. The functions are safe and standard in nature.",
