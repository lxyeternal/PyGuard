  "purpose": "Define a base class for a PostgREST client that manages HTTP sessions and authentication methods.",
  "sources": "is_http_url, is_valid_jwt, and the creation of headers and session objects.",
  "sinks": "Setting Authorization headers, assigning session authentication, raising exceptions.",
  "flows": "Input URLs and tokens flow into validation and header/session setup; session headers and auth are configured accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials present; no suspicious code structures or obfuscation. The code appears standard for a client library.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract base class for a REST client, with methods for initializing connection parameters and authenticating via bearer tokens or basic auth. Validation functions are used to verify URL format and JWT tokens. Headers are set dynamically based on provided parameters. No input from untrusted sources other than parameters is directly handled, and no data leaks or suspicious behaviors are evident. No malicious code, backdoors, or malicious network activities are present. The code relies on external utility functions for validation, which, assuming correctness, do not introduce security issues. Overall, the code appears to be a typical, safe client setup without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured client class with proper validation and authentication handling. No malicious behaviors or security risks are evident based on this fragment.",
