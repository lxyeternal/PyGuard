  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is just import statements, with no dynamic execution, data handling, or network activity. It assigns a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.  \n- **Potential issues:** No issues found; the reasoning is sound.  \n- **Risk score:** 0, justified by the lack of any suspicious or malicious activity.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it notes the absence of untrusted data, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The presence of deprecated modules is noted but not flagged as malicious.  \n- **Potential issues:** No anomalies or suspicious patterns; the reasoning appears solid.  \n- **Risk score:** 0, which is reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is only import statements with no data flow or suspicious behavior.  \n- **Potential issues:** No issues; the reasoning is consistent.  \n- **Risk score:** 0, appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Assessment:** The same pattern; purely import statements, no malicious activity.  \n- **Potential issues:** No anomalies or suspicious behavior.  \n- **Risk score:** 0.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion: standard import setup, no malicious activity.  \n- **Potential issues:** No issues detected.  \n- **Risk score:** 0.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is only import statements, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0 or very low) are consistent with the code's nature.\n- No assumptions are made beyond what the code shows; all conclusions are justified.\n\n### Final Evaluation:\nGiven the nature of the code—just import statements with no dynamic execution, no data processing, no network activity, and no suspicious patterns—the risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should all remain at **0**.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis is a safe assessment based on the provided code snippet and reports.",
