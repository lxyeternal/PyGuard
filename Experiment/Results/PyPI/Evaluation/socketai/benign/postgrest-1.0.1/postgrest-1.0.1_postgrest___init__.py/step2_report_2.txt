  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Assessment:** The report correctly states that the code is just import statements with no active data processing, network communication, or dynamic code execution. The confidence is high (1), and no anomalies, malware, or security risks are identified.  \n- **Verdict:** The conclusion that this code is benign and typical for a Python client library is accurate. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it emphasizes the absence of untrusted data processing, network calls, or suspicious patterns. The confidence is slightly lower (0.9), but overall consistent.  \n- **Verdict:** The conclusion is appropriate. No modifications necessary.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Assessment:** Again, the report notes the straightforward import structure, presence of deprecated modules, and lack of malicious activity. The confidence is 0.9, which seems reasonable.  \n- **Verdict:** The assessment aligns with the code. No adjustments needed.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Assessment:** The report recognizes the import-only nature, absence of data flows, and no suspicious behavior. Confidence is high (1).  \n- **Verdict:** The conclusion is sound; no changes required.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar to others, confirming that the code is just setup imports with no malicious activity or obfuscation. Confidence is 1.  \n- **Verdict:** The assessment is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward import statements.\n- **Risk Score:** Since the code is purely import statements with no active or suspicious behavior, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Overall, the reports are consistent and accurate.** There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks in this code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0  \n\nThis aligns with the assessments, as the code is a standard, benign module import section for a Python API client library.\n\n**Final note:** No further action is necessary; the code appears safe and well-structured.",
