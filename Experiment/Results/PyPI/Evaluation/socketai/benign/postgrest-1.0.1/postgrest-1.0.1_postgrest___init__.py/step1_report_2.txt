{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a client library for interacting with a PostgREST API, providing both synchronous and asynchronous request builders and clients.",
  "sources": "Imports modules, classes, and constants from local files and external libraries (httpx). No input or external data reading is evident.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data, user input, or external data are present; the code mainly defines imports and module structure.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from sources to sinks; the code only sets up class and function imports without executing data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic are present. The code structure and imports are typical for a client SDK.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various classes and modules related to HTTP requests, client implementations, request builders, constants, exceptions, and version info. It does not contain any data processing, input handling, or network communication logic within this snippet. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The presence of deprecated modules suggests ongoing maintenance but does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the code functions as a library setup and does not perform any malicious or security-risk actions.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard module import setup for a client SDK, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe and typical for such a library.",
