  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and critically, considering the provided code snippet and the logic behind each assessment.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code is a set of import statements for a Python package supporting synchronous and asynchronous interactions with a PostgREST API.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing is present in this snippet.\n- All imports are from internal modules or standard libraries, with no evident handling of untrusted input or external data.\n- There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns.\n- The presence of deprecated modules suggests legacy support but not malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity, malware, or security risks.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.\n- **Verdict:** **Accurate.** The reasoning is sound; the code is straightforward import statements with no suspicious elements.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, with a slightly lower confidence (0.9) and a small security risk (0.1).\n- **Score justification:** No untrusted data or network activity; the minor security risk likely accounts for deprecated modules or potential legacy issues.\n- **Verdict:** **Reasonable.** The low security risk score is acceptable, given the context.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, emphasizing standard import setup with no malicious behavior.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.\n- **Verdict:** **Appropriate.** The reasoning aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports, no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct.** The analysis is thorough and justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same as others, standard import structure with no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.\n- **Verdict:** **Appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation & Recommendations:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward import setup for a client library.\n- The malware scores are appropriately set to 0 across all reports, as there is no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- The security risk scores are minimal or zero, which is reasonable given the code snippet.\n\n### **Potential Adjustments:**\n\n- Given the uniformity and the lack of any suspicious activity, I would **not** increase any scores.\n- The minor security risk score of 0.1 in Report 2 could be further reduced to 0, considering the absence of any security concerns in this code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Estimate:**\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis reflects the fact that the code is a standard, non-malicious module import section, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code appears safe, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
