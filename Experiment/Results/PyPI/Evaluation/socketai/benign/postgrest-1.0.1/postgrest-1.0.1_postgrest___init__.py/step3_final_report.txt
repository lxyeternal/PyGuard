{
  "purpose": "This code snippet serves as a module import setup for a Python client library supporting synchronous and asynchronous interactions with a PostgREST API, facilitating API requests and handling responses.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules, standard libraries, and deprecated components",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, network calls, or data sinks are present in this code",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only establishes module dependencies",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward import statements with no dynamic execution or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for various internal modules and constants, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns. The presence of deprecated modules indicates legacy support but does not imply malicious intent. The code's structure is typical for a Python package setup, and it does not interact with untrusted inputs or external systems.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module import setup for a Python API client library. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is negligible (0). All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, and no modifications are necessary.",
