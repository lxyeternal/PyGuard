  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** The code is purely import statements with no dynamic execution, no network activity, or handling of untrusted input.  \n- **Assessment:** The conclusion that there's no malicious activity or security risk is accurate. The malware score of 0 aligns with this.  \n- **Score adjustments:** No change needed.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, the code only imports modules/classes; no data flows or suspicious patterns.  \n- **Assessment:** The low confidence (0.9) and malware score (0) are appropriate. The security risk is minimal, given the lack of any active code or data handling.  \n- **Score adjustments:** No change needed.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as above—imports only, no suspicious activity.  \n- **Assessment:** The confidence and malware scores are consistent.  \n- **Score adjustments:** No change needed.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Again, only import statements with no active or suspicious code.  \n- **Assessment:** The confidence and malware scores are appropriate.  \n- **Score adjustments:** No change needed.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as others—imports only, no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Assessment:** The scores are consistent.  \n- **Score adjustments:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **Code presence of malware:** 0 across all reports, as all are static import statements with no malicious behavior.  \n- **Obfuscated code:** 0, no obfuscation detected.  \n- **Risk score:** Given the absence of active code, data handling, or network activity, the overall risk remains very low (around 0).\n\n### Final recommendation:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (to reflect minimal risk due to presence of deprecated modules, which could be a maintenance concern but not a security threat)\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard, safe module import setup for a Python client library with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities.**",
