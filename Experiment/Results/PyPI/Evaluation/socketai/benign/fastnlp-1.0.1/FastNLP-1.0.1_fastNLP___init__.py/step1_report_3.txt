  "purpose": "Import modules from the fastNLP library for environment and core functionalities.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'fastNLP.envs' and 'fastNLP.core'.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "Imports from external modules, no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports all contents from 'fastNLP.envs' and 'fastNLP.core' modules, which are part of the fastNLP library. There are no functions, user inputs, or network operations present. The version string indicates the package version. The code appears to be a simple module import without any malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical import statement for a Python package and shows no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It simply prepares the environment for further use of the fastNLP library.",
