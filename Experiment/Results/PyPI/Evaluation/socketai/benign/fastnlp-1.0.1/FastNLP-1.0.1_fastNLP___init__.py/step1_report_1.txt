{
  "purpose": "Import modules from the fastNLP library, likely for NLP-related tasks.",
  "sources": "Import statements from fastNLP.envs and fastNLP.core modules.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks; no untrusted data handling or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only imports modules.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code with only import statements and a version string; no suspicious or unusual code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific modules from a well-known library (fastNLP). The version string indicates package versioning but does not perform any operation. No dynamic execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling observed. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code present. The code is standard and appears legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign code snippet solely importing modules from the fastNLP library. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
