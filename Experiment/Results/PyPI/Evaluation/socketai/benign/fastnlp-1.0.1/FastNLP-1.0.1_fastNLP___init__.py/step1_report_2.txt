{
  "purpose": "Import modules from the fastNLP library, likely for natural language processing tasks.",
  "sources": "Imports from fastNLP.envs and fastNLP.core modules",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flows observed; import statements are static",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; only import statements and version declaration",
  "analysis": "The code solely imports all symbols from fastNLP.envs and fastNLP.core, which are standard library modules for NLP processing. The version string is a standard attribute, not suspicious. There are no dynamic code executions, data handling, or sensitive operations. The import of entire modules is common and does not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module import with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It appears to be part of a larger application setup, with no signs of sabotage or malicious activity.",
