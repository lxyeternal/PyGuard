{
  "purpose": "The code imports modules from the fastNLP library, likely for use in a larger application or script, and defines a version string.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'fastNLP.envs' and 'fastNLP.core' modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data output, network activity, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only imports modules and sets a version string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is minimal and straightforward. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports entire modules from fastNLP, a known open-source NLP library, and sets a version identifier. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or execution of dynamic code. No suspicious behaviors or malicious patterns are evident. The simplicity and conventional nature of this snippet suggest normal library usage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module import and version declaration, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
