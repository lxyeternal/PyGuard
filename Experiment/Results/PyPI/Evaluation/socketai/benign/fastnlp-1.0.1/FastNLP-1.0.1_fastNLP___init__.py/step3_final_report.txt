{
  "purpose": "The code imports modules from the fastNLP library and sets a version string, serving as a setup or configuration snippet.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'fastNLP.envs' and 'fastNLP.core', and the assignment of '__version__'.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any actions that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources; the code only imports modules and sets a version string without dynamic execution or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, static, and contains no obfuscated or suspicious elements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements and a version string, with no dynamic code, network activity, or data processing. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this snippet. The scores assigned—malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0—are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The high confidence scores reflect the straightforward and benign nature of the code. Overall, the code is a standard setup snippet with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only import statements and a version string. There is no malicious or suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risk. The current scores are justified and accurate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
