  "purpose": "Import modules from the fastNLP library, likely for NLP tasks or utilities.",
  "sources": "Imports from fastNLP.envs and fastNLP.core modules.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or potentially harmful actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths observable; just module imports and version assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscation detected. The code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific submodules from the fastNLP package, which is a legitimate open-source NLP library. It assigns a version string. There are no user inputs, data handling, or network operations. No anomalies or suspicious behavior are apparent. The code appears to be standard initialization or setup code.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a typical import and version declaration with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It is safe based on the provided code.",
