{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class 'EarlyStopException' used for controlling early stopping during training routines.",
  "sources": "The class accepts a message parameter in its __init__ method, which is stored as an attribute.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, external data handling, or network operations are present; no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Input message flows from instantiation to storage in the exception object; no external data flows or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple custom exception inheriting from BaseException, with an __init__ method that stores a message. All reports agree on its benign nature, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The class serves as a control flow mechanism for early stopping in training routines, which is common practice. No external data handling, network activity, or malicious code is present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard custom exception class used for early stopping in training routines. There are no malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing scores are justified and should remain as-is.",
