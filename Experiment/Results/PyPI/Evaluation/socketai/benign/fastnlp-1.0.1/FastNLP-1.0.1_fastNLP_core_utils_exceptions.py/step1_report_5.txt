{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class for early stopping during model training.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; exception message stored but not used in a risky manner.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Simple class definition with no suspicious logic, no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code introduces an 'EarlyStopException' class inheriting from BaseException, used to interrupt training loops. The class constructor takes a message parameter and stores it, which is standard practice for custom exceptions. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are apparent. The code appears to be a benign utility class intended for control flow in machine learning training routines.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, harmless custom exception class with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
