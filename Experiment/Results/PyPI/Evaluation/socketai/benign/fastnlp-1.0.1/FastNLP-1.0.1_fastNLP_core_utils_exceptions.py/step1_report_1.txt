{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception for early stopping during model training to facilitate control flow in training loops.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; the code only defines a class.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; the class does not perform any I/O or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; class instantiation is straightforward.",
  "anomalies": "The class is a simple exception wrapper with no suspicious behavior or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class named EarlyStopException intended for use during model training. It inherits from BaseException and adds an init method to store a message. The code is minimal, straightforward, and does not perform any external operations, data handling, or malicious activity. There are no signs of obfuscation, hidden behavior, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign definition of a custom exception class used for control flow in training routines. There are no malicious behaviors or security risks present.",
