  "purpose": "Define a custom exception for early stopping during model training.",
  "sources": "Class definition, __init__ method receiving a message parameter.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform side effects.",
  "flows": "Input message passed to superclass __init__, stored in self.msg.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behavior detected. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple custom exception class intended to be used for early stopping during training. It inherits from BaseException, allowing it to be raised and caught like other exceptions. The class only stores a message string. There are no external data sources, network operations, or data manipulations that could lead to security risks or malicious activity. The class appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward custom exception class used for control flow in training routines. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks.",
