  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for early stopping during training loops.",
  "sources": "The class definition and its __init__ method, which assigns a message to the exception instance.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or handle untrusted data or perform I/O operations.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no data flows involving untrusted input or output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the class is a straightforward custom exception with a descriptive docstring. No suspicious or unusual code features.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class inheriting from BaseException, with a constructor that passes a message to the superclass and stores it. The purpose appears to be for signaling early stopping in training routines. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The implementation is simple and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign custom exception class intended for use in training workflows. No malicious or security-related issues are detected.",
