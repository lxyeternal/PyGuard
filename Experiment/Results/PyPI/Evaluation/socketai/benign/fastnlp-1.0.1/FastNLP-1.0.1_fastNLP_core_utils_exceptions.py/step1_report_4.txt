  "purpose": "Define a custom exception for early stopping in training loops",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations present in this snippet",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations that could be vulnerable",
  "flows": "No data flows; this is a simple class definition for an exception",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard exception class with a message attribute",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception 'EarlyStopException' inheriting from BaseException, intended for use during training processes to signal early termination. It includes an init method that stores a message. The code appears to be straightforward, with no indications of malicious intent or obfuscated logic. There are no external data sources, sinks, or suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard exception class with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It serves a specific purpose in controlling training flow.",
