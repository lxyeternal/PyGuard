{
  "purpose": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project using setuptools, reading metadata and dependencies from files, and configuring package discovery.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md', 'LICENSE', and 'requirements.txt' files; uses find_packages() to locate packages; reads dependencies from requirements.txt.",
  "sinks": "None present; the code does not process untrusted data beyond reading files and configuring setup.",
  "flows": "Reads files -> processes content -> passes data to setup() function; no untrusted data flow leading to vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with standard practices. No obfuscation or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with no malicious or suspicious logic. The only potential concern is dependencies listed in requirements.txt, which could be malicious if compromised, but this is external to the code itself. The reports are empty, providing no evidence of issues. Therefore, the malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and overall security risk is minimal.",
  "conclusion": "The package setup code is benign, standard, and free of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The absence of detailed reports or suspicious patterns supports a low-risk assessment.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
