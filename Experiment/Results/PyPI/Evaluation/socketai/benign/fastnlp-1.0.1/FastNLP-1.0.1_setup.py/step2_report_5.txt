  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review for Potential Issues:**\n\n   - The code appears to be a standard `setup.py` script for packaging a Python project.\n   - It reads `README.md`, `LICENSE`, and `requirements.txt` files correctly.\n   - It filters packages to include only those starting with `'fastNLP'`.\n   - It uses `install_requires` by splitting the contents of `requirements.txt` on newlines, which is typical.\n   - No obvious malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present in this script.\n   - The code is straightforward and standard for a Python package setup.\n\n2. **Issues or Flaws in the Reported Data:**\n\n   - All reports indicate \"Empty response\" with no further details.\n   - There are no specific claims, vulnerabilities, or malware indications provided in these reports.\n   - Without additional context or details, it's impossible to identify any security issues, malware, or code flaws from these reports alone.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning:**\n\n   - Since no specific issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are described, the malware score should be **0**.\n   - The obfuscated score should also be **0**, as there's no evidence of obfuscation.\n   - The risk score should be **0** because there's no demonstrated security concern.\n\n4. **Critical Evaluation:**\n\n   - The reports are empty; thus, there's no basis for suspecting malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n   - The code itself is standard and does not contain any suspicious or malicious patterns.\n   - Without further details, any suspicion would be unwarranted.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Final note:** Given the lack of information and the standard nature of the code, I conclude there are no security issues or malware present in this package based on the provided data.",
