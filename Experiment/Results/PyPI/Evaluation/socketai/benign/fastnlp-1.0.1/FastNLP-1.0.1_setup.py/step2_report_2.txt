  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the report details step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Potential Issues:**\n   - The code is a typical `setup.py` script for a Python package.\n   - It reads `README.md`, `LICENSE`, and `requirements.txt` files.\n   - It filters packages to include only those starting with `'fastNLP'`.\n   - It prints the selected packages.\n   - It calls `setup()` with relevant metadata.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Vulnerable Code:**\n   - The code appears standard and does not contain any obfuscated or malicious logic.\n   - No code injections, dynamic code execution, or suspicious operations are present.\n   - The package dependencies are read from `requirements.txt`, which could be a vector for malicious dependencies, but this is not inherently malicious in the code itself.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - All reports indicate \"Empty response\" with no details. This suggests either a failure in the reporting process or missing reports.\n   - Without detailed reports, it's impossible to identify specific vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n\n4. **Scores and Their Justification:**\n   - Since no specific issues are reported, the malware score should be low, close to 0.\n   - The obfuscated score should also be low, as there's no obfuscation.\n   - The overall risk score should be minimal, assuming no hidden malicious intent.\n\n5. **Potential Risks and Assumptions:**\n   - The only concern could be the contents of `requirements.txt`. If it contains malicious packages, that could be a supply chain risk, but this is external to the code.\n   - The code itself is straightforward and does not exhibit any malicious patterns.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the code provided and the empty reports, I estimate:\n     - **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n     - **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n     - **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, mostly due to external dependencies, but no evidence of malicious intent)\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- The scores should remain low given the evidence.\n- The reports are empty, so no further action is needed unless new information emerges.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code appears benign.\n- The report lacks details, making further analysis impossible.\n- Scores should be minimal, reflecting the lack of evidence for malicious or obfuscated code.",
