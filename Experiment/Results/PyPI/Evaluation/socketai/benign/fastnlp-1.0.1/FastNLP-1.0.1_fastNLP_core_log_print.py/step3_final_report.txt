  "purpose": "Redefines the built-in print function to redirect output to a logger at INFO level, facilitating logging of print statements.",
  "sources": "Arguments passed to the print function, specifically *args which are converted to strings and joined.",
  "sinks": "The logger._log method, which outputs the message; potential exposure if logger logs sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Input arguments → join with separator → logger._log call if logging enabled at INFO level.",
  "anomalies": "Use of internal logger methods (_add_rank_info, _log) which are non-standard; no external data sources or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code redefines print to send messages to a logger, checking if INFO level is enabled before logging. It converts all arguments to strings, joins them, and logs the message. No network activity, data exfiltration, or hardcoded secrets are present. The use of internal logger methods is unconventional but not malicious. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected. The purpose appears benign, serving as a utility for logging print statements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign redefinition of print for logging purposes. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The scores from the reports are appropriate, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a very low security risk score of 0 or 0.1 due to internal method use. Overall, the code is safe and intended for standard logging enhancement.",
