  "conclusion": "The code is a benign redefinition of print for logging purposes. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The scores from the reports are appropriate, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a very low security risk score of 0 or 0.1 due to internal method use. Overall, the code is safe and intended for standard logging enhancement."
