{
  "purpose": "Redefines the built-in print function to redirect output to a logger at INFO level.",
  "sources": "Input arguments to the print function (*args), logger configuration (logger.isEnabledFor), and logger methods (_add_rank_info, _log).",
  "sinks": "None identified that lead to data leaks or system effects; the code simply formats and logs messages.",
  "flows": "Arguments to print are converted to strings, joined, and passed to logger._log, which logs the message.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. The code overrides print for logging purposes and does not perform malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code redefines the print function to redirect output to a logger, which is a common practice for debugging or production logging. It uses the logger's internal methods to log messages at INFO level, checking if logging is enabled for that level. The implementation appears straightforward and intended for standard logging. No malicious behavior or malicious code constructs are present. There are no code injection, data leakage, or system-impacting operations. It does not handle untrusted input insecurely, nor does it perform network operations or access sensitive data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign override of the print function to facilitate logging. It does not contain malware or malicious intent. It appears to be a standard logging utility with no security risks.",
