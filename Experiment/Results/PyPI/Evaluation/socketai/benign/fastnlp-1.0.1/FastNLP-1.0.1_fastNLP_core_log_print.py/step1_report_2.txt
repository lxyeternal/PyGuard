{
  "purpose": "Redefines the built-in print function to redirect output to a logger, facilitating logging instead of standard console output.",
  "sources": "None explicitly, the code only uses provided parameters and imports; it reads nothing from external inputs.",
  "sinks": "logger._log method, which logs messages at INFO level, potentially exposing sensitive data if used improperly.",
  "flows": "Input arguments to the print function are joined into a string and passed to logger._log for logging.",
  "anomalies": "The code redefines the built-in print function; no unusual or suspicious behavior is observed. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the print function to redirect output to a logging system, which is common practice for controlled logging. It uses standard library and a custom logger, with no data leaks or malicious actions detected. The code appears to be straightforward and safe, with no obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, non-malicious redefinition of the print function for logging purposes. No malware or security risks are evident.",
