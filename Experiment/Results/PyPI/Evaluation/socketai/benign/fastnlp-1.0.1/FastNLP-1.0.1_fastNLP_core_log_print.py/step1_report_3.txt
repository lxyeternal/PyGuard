{
  "purpose": "Override the built-in print function to redirect output to a logger.info call, facilitating logging within an application.",
  "sources": "The print function reads *args and the logger's isEnabledFor method, which checks logging level.",
  "sinks": "The logger.info method could potentially process untrusted data, but this is standard logging behavior and not inherently malicious.",
  "flows": "Input arguments are converted to strings, joined with separator, then passed to logger._log as INFO level message.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a private method logger._add_rank_info and logger._log, which are internal methods not intended for public use; no external or untrusted input source is evident beyond standard arguments.",
  "analysis": "The code redefines print to send messages to a logger, capturing standard print output for logging purposes. It checks if logging at INFO level is enabled before proceeding, and formats the message accordingly. No external data sources, network calls, or environment variable usages are present. The use of internal logger methods may suggest non-standard implementation but does not indicate malicious behavior. The code appears safe, serving a typical purpose of redirecting print statements to logs.",
  "conclusion": "This code safely redefines the print function to redirect output to a logger. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. It does not contain malware, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. It functions as intended for logging purposes.",
