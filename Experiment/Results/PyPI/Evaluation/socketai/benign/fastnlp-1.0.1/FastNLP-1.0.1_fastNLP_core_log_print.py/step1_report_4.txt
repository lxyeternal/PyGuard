  "purpose": "Redefines the print function to redirect output to a logger at INFO level.",
  "sources": "Code reads input arguments (*args, sep, end, file, flush) for the print function; reads from logger to check if logging is enabled.",
  "sinks": "logger._log method used for output; no external or untrusted data sink identified.",
  "flows": "Input arguments are joined into a string and passed to logger._log if logging is enabled.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors. The code simply redirects print output to a logger.",
  "analysis": "The code redefines print to redirect output to a logger, ensuring that print statements are logged instead of printing to stdout. It uses the logger's internal methods to log messages at INFO level. There are no external data sources, no unsafe handling of untrusted input, and no suspicious behavior observed. The code appears to be a straightforward logging utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign redefinition of print for logging purposes, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
