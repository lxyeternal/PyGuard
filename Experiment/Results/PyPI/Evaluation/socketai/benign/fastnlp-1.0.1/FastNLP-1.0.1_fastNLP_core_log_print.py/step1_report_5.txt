  "purpose": "Override the built-in print function to redirect output to a logger at INFO level.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to the custom print function (*args, sep, end, file, flush).",
  "sinks": "The logger._log method, which logs messages; potential exposure of logged data if logger logs sensitive information.",
  "flows": "Input args -> join with sep -> log via logger._log if logger is enabled for INFO.",
  "anomalies": "Redefinition of print is limited to a module, not globally affecting the environment; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code redefines the print function to route messages to a logger instead of standard output. It uses logger.isEnabledFor(INFO) to check logging level, and if enabled, constructs a message from the arguments and logs it. The implementation relies on a custom logger with methods _add_rank_info and _log, which are presumably internal. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious patterns, and does not perform any malicious actions or data exfiltration. It primarily modifies logging behavior, which is a common and benign practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign redefinition of print to redirect output to a logger, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
