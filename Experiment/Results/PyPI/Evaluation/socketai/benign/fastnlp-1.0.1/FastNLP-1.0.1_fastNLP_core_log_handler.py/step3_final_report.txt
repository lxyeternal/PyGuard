{
  "purpose": "Provides custom logging handlers with tqdm integration and stdout stream management for enhanced logging capabilities.",
  "sources": "Imports from tqdm.auto, sys.stdout, and environment variables for logging levels.",
  "sinks": "Logging handlers that output formatted log messages to tqdm.write or sys.stdout.",
  "flows": "Log records are formatted and sent to handlers, which write to tqdm or stdout, with exception handling for errors.",
  "anomalies": "The setStream method raises a RuntimeError intentionally, which is unusual but documented; no malicious activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines logging handlers for enhanced output, with conditional import of tqdm, custom emit methods, and a specialized stdout handler. No external data sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. Exception handling is standard, and no obfuscation or suspicious patterns are evident. The unusual setStream method raising RuntimeError is a design choice, not malicious. Overall, the code is benign utility code for logging purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign logging utility with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the minimal risk score reflects the unconventional method but does not indicate threat.",
