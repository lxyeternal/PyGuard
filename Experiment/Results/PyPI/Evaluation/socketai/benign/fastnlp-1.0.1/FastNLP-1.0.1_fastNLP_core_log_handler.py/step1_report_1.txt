{
  "purpose": "Provides custom logging handlers, including integration with tqdm progress bars and stdout stream handling.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (logging, sys, tqdm) and class constructors; no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "Uses tqdm.write and sys.stdout.write for output; no untrusted data sinks capable of malicious actions identified.",
  "flows": "Logging records are formatted and written to tqdm or sys.stdout streams without external data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. Exception handling in emit methods appears standard; setStream method raises RuntimeError intentionally, not suspicious. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines logging handlers for enhanced logging features, especially in environments with tqdm progress bars. The conditional import of tqdm and fallback to a standard stream handler is typical. The custom StdoutStreamHandler overrides flush and emit to handle stdout reliably. No external data sources, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns are present. Overall, the code appears to be legitimate utility code for logging enhancements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard logging utility code with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or malware. It is well-structured, with exception handling and fallback mechanisms, and does not include any suspicious or malicious activity.",
