{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom highlighter class for styling text with a specified color using the rich library.",
  "sources": "Imports from rich.highlighter module; instantiation of ColorHighlighter class; calling highlight method with text input.",
  "sinks": "The highlight method applies stylization to the text; potential output modification or styling if used improperly.",
  "flows": "Import -> Class instantiation -> highlight method called -> text.stylize applied.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no use of untrusted input sources; no suspicious external calls or network activity; code is straightforward and utility-focused.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a highlighter class from a well-known library, defines a subclass that applies a color style to text, and provides a method to stylize text. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation. The functionality appears to be purely for styling text in terminal output. No external or untrusted data sources or sinks are present, and the code does not perform any network activity or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple extension of a text highlighter for styling purposes. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be legitimate and safe.",
