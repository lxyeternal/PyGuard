  "purpose": "A subclass of 'Highlighter' that applies a specified color style to text via the 'stylize' method.",
  "sources": "The 'highlight' method receives 'text' as input, which is stylized.",
  "sinks": "The 'text.stylize(self.color)' call applies styling; no untrusted data flows into insecure sinks.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' flows directly into 'stylize' method without external or untrusted data sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward styling operation with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple subclass that stylizes text with a color. It does not perform network activity, handle secrets, or execute malicious operations. The 'highlight' method applies styling directly to the 'text' object, which is benign. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The minimal security risk stems from styling effects, which do not constitute a security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for styling terminal output with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports correctly identify its safety. The security risk score should be 0, and malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate at 0.",
