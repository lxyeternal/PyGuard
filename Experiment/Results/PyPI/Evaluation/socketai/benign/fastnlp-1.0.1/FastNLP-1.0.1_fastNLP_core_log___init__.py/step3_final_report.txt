  "purpose": "Module exposes 'logger' and 'print' functions/modules for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports 'logger' from .logger and 'print' from .print modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "Imports are static; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual naming of 'print' as a module or function, but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal API declaration, importing 'logger' and 'print' modules/functions, and defining __all__ for exports. No data processing, external communication, or dynamic code execution occurs. The inclusion of 'print' in __all__ may be unconventional but not malicious. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and intended for module export purposes. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The minor concern about 'print' naming does not impact security.",
