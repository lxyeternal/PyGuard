  "purpose": "Define public API by exposing 'logger' and 'print' modules/functions",
  "sources": "Import statements from relative modules (.logger, .print)",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external communication",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; import statements only",
  "anomalies": "Unusual inclusion of 'print' in __all__; potentially misleading but not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code simply declares an __all__ list to specify exported symbols, then imports 'logger' and 'print' modules/functions from relative paths. There are no input handling, data processing, or external communication components. The inclusion of 'print' in __all__ may suggest the module intends to expose it as a public API, but this alone is not suspicious. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior present in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module setup defining public exports. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from this fragment.",
