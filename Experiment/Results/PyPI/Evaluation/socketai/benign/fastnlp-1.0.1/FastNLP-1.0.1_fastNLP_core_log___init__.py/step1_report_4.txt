  "purpose": "Define an __all__ list for module exports and import logger and print functions from local modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.logger and .print)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports modules and defines exports.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual inclusion of 'print' as a module or function for export; potential confusion or misconfiguration. No actual malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets the __all__ list for public interface, exposing 'logger' and 'print'. It imports these from local modules. The use of 'print' as an import from a local module might be unconventional, but it does not indicate malicious intent. No code execution, data leakage, or malicious behavior is observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup with no malicious activity. The only minor concern is the naming of 'print', which may be a custom module, but this alone is not suspicious.",
