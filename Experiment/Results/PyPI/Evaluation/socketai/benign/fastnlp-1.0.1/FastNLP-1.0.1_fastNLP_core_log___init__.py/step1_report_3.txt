  "purpose": "Define public interface for modules, exposing logger and print functionalities.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.logger and .print).",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; no output or network operations present.",
  "flows": "Imports from local modules, then exports 'logger' and 'print' for external use.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code simply declares an export list, then imports 'logger' and 'print' modules from local files. The purpose appears to be establishing a public API. No code executes untrusted input, performs network operations, or contains suspicious behaviors. The structure and content are typical for a module's __all__ declaration and import statements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and benign, serving as a module interface declaration without any malicious intent or security risks.",
