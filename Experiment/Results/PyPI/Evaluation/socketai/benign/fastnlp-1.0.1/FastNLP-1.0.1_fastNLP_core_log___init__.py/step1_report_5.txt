{
  "purpose": "This code is intended to expose and re-export the logger and print modules for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads the modules 'logger' and 'print' via relative imports.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code that handle untrusted data or could lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules 'logger' and 'print' which are then available for use in other parts of the project.",
  "anomalies": "Using 'print' as a module name is unusual and potentially confusing, but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code declares an __all__ list to define public API, then imports 'logger' and 'print' modules from the same package. No data processing, no dynamic execution, no external data sources, and no potential sinks. The naming of 'print' as a module is unconventional but not malicious. Overall, the code appears to be a simple module re-export with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward module re-export file with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
