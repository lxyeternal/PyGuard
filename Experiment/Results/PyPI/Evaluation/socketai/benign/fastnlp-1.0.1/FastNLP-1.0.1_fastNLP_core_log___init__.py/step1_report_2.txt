  "purpose": "Define public API with logger and print functions for external modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.logger and .print).",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; imports are standard module references.",
  "flows": "The imported logger and print functions are made available externally; no data flow from untrusted sources is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code only defines __all__ and imports, with no suspicious or unusual behavior. The inclusion of 'print' in __all__ is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code sets an __all__ list for controlling what is exported when the module is imported elsewhere. It imports 'logger' and 'print' from local modules. There are no data inputs, network connections, or code execution flows. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple module defining exports for logger and print functions. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The code appears benign and standard for a package interface.",
