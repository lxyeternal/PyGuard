The assigned malware score of 0 and security risk score of approximately 0.2 are appropriate, considering the environment-variable reliance and distributed setup. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk and is safe for use."

The scores from the reports are appropriate, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a very low security risk score of 0 or 0.1 due to internal method use. Overall, the code is safe and intended for standard logging enhancement."
