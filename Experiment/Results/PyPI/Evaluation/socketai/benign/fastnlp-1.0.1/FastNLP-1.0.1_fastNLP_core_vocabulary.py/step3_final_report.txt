  "purpose": "A utility class for constructing, managing, and serializing a vocabulary mapping between strings and integers for NLP tasks.",
  "sources": "Dataset fields, input lists, and file I/O operations for saving/loading vocabulary data.",
  "sinks": "File writing/reading during save and load operations.",
  "flows": "Data from datasets or input lists flow into internal counters and dictionaries, then to disk during save/load.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard vocabulary management functions including updating counts, building mappings, serialization, and dataset indexing. It uses common patterns such as decorators for build checks and file I/O for persistence. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or external system calls are present. The code is well-structured, with clear separation of concerns, and adheres to typical NLP utility design. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard NLP vocabulary utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs expected functions without suspicious patterns or external dependencies. The security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero.",
