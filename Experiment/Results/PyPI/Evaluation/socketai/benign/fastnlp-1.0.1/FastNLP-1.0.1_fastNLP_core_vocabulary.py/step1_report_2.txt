  "purpose": "This code defines a Python class 'Vocabulary' for constructing, storing, and using a word-to-index mapping, primarily for NLP tasks. It includes methods for updating, building, saving, and loading vocabularies, and managing special tokens.",
  "sources": "Reads from and writes to files in 'save' and 'load' methods; accesses class properties; reads data from datasets via 'apply' and 'apply_field' methods.",
  "sinks": "File operations in 'save' and 'load' methods; no direct data sink or network activity; no execution of untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Data is read from dataset objects and files, then processed into internal dictionaries; data is written to files in 'save'; no untrusted data flows into system commands or network.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, no backdoors, no suspicious network connections, and no system modifications observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages vocabulary data structures with methods for updating, building, saving, and loading from files. Decorators ensure vocabulary is built before access and warn about size limits. File I/O operations are standard and confined to reading/writing vocabulary info. There is no evidence of malicious code such as data exfiltration, remote command execution, or network activity. Usage of logging and exception handling appears routine. No obfuscation, backdoors, or hidden behaviors are detected. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of vocabulary management with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard vocabulary management module for NLP tasks. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or suspicious activities are detected. The overall security risk is low.",
