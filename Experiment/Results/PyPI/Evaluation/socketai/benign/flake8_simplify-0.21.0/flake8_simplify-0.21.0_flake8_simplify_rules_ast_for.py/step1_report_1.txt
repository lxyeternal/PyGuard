  "purpose": "This code provides static analysis functions for Python AST to identify patterns that can be simplified or improved, such as use of 'yield from', 'any'/'all', or 'enumerate'.",
  "sources": "Reads AST nodes representing 'for' loops, 'if' statements, assignments, and expressions; uses 'to_source' utility to convert AST nodes to source code strings.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'to_source' to generate source code strings from AST nodes, which are then formatted into messages. No direct data leak or untrusted data handling is present.",
  "flows": "AST node analysis flows from examining loop bodies and sibling nodes to suggest code improvements, mainly through pattern detection.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; code appears to be straightforward static analysis functions. No obfuscated code features are detected.",
  "analysis": "The functions analyze AST nodes for specific patterns indicating opportunities for refactoring, such as replacing manual iteration with 'yield from', 'any', 'all', or 'enumerate'. The code contains logical checks, parent-child node traversals, and pattern matching. No signs of malicious code or malicious behavior are evident. It strictly performs static pattern detection and generates hints for code improvement.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of static analysis utilities designed to improve code readability and efficiency. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It is purely analytical with no malicious intent.",
