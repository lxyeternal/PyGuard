{
  "purpose": "The code analyzes Python class definitions to identify classes that explicitly inherit from 'object' for style enforcement.",
  "sources": "The function reads the 'node' parameter, which is an AST node representing a class definition.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not write data, execute untrusted input, or perform any I/O operations.",
  "flows": "The flow involves checking the class node attributes to determine inheritance from 'object'. No external data flow is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs a straightforward AST analysis with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'ast' module to work with Python's Abstract Syntax Tree. It defines a function that takes a class node and checks if it inherits directly from 'object'. If so, it generates a warning message suggesting to omit '(object)'. The logic is simple and intended for style checking, not malicious behavior. There are no external data inputs, outputs, or side effects. The code does not contain obfuscation, malicious instructions, or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign style enforcement utility that identifies explicit 'object' inheritance in class definitions. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is present.",
