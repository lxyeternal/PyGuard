  "purpose": "The code analyzes Python AST nodes to identify class definitions that explicitly inherit from 'object' and suggests modern syntax.",
  "sources": "Input: AST node representing a class definition (ast.ClassDef).",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data output or external operations.",
  "flows": "The function reads the 'node' input (source), analyzes its 'bases' attribute, and conditionally appends to errors (sink).",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward and does not include suspicious or unusual constructs. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The function inspects class inheritance to find classes that inherit explicitly from 'object' and suggests replacing the inheritance syntax. It uses standard AST properties and simple string formatting. No external data, network access, or code execution occurs. The logic is clear, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility to enforce modern Python class syntax. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident.",
