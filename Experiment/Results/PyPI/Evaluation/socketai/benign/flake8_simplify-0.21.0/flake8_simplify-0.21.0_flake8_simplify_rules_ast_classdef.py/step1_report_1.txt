{
  "purpose": "The code analyzes Python class definitions to identify classes that explicitly inherit from 'object' to suggest modernization of class syntax.",
  "sources": "The code reads the AST node representing class definitions (ast.ClassDef).",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data; the code only inspects the AST structure for pattern matching.",
  "flows": "The flow is from the class node inspection to error generation if the class inherits explicitly from 'object'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code performs a straightforward AST pattern check.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'ast' module for AST manipulation and defines a function that checks whether a class explicitly inherits from 'object'. If it does, it appends a message suggesting using the modern class syntax. The function is purely diagnostic and does not execute or modify runtime code. It does not include any external inputs, network activity, or malicious logic. The logic is clear, standard, and focused on code style enforcement.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple static analysis tool for style consistency, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is benign and solely aimed at improving code style.",
