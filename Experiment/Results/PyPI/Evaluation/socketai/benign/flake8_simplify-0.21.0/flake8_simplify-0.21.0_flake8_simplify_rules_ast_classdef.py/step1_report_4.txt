{
  "purpose": "The code analyzes Python class definitions to identify classes that explicitly inherit from 'object' to enforce modern class declaration practices.",
  "sources": "The code reads the class definition node (ast.ClassDef) from the AST structure.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; it does not process untrusted input or data flows leading to potential vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "The flow is from the class definition node (source) to the conditional check (processing), which then may append a message (error) to the errors list if a class inherits from 'object'.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs a straightforward style check; there are no anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that inspects AST class nodes to detect inheritance from 'object'. It verifies if a class explicitly inherits from 'object' and, if so, generates a suggestion to modernize the class declaration. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. The code is simple, readable, and purpose-specific.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless style enforcement tool with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs static code analysis to promote Python best practices.",
