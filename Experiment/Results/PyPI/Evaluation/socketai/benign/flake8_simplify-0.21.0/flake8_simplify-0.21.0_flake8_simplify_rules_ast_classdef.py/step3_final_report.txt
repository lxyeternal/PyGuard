  "purpose": "Static analysis utility to detect classes explicitly inheriting from 'object' and suggest modern syntax.",
  "sources": "AST node's bases attribute (node.bases), class name (node.name), line number (node.lineno), column offset (node.col_offset)",
  "sinks": "None; code does not process untrusted data or perform side effects",
  "flows": "AST node's bases -> condition check -> error message append",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static analysis with no suspicious or unusual code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code inspects AST class nodes to identify explicit inheritance from 'object'. It checks if the class has exactly one base, which is an ast.Name with id 'object'. If so, it appends a style warning suggesting to omit '(object)'. The logic is simple, correct, and does not involve any malicious or obfuscated behavior. No external data, network activity, or unsafe operations are present. The code is purely for style enforcement, with no security implications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, style-focused static analysis with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its purpose and assign appropriate scores. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0. No adjustments are necessary.",
