{
  "purpose": "The code analyzes Python class definitions to identify classes that explicitly inherit from 'object' and suggests a more modern syntax.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'node' parameter representing an AST class node, accessing its 'bases' attribute and class name.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data flows into sensitive operations or data leaks.",
  "flows": "The function inspects class nodes, checks their inheritance, and generates an error message if they inherit from 'object'. No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks exists.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not contain obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs. The logic is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The function inspects AST class nodes to determine if they inherit explicitly from 'object'. If so, it adds a stylistic warning suggesting to omit '(object)'. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious operations. The code performs static code analysis and is purely informational.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple static analysis utility to promote modern class syntax. It poses no security risks or malware concerns.",
