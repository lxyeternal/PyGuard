  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if the reported issues are present in the code.**\n\n- The code consists solely of import statements and tuple definitions for AST node types related to constants, strings, and booleans.\n- No dynamic code execution, data processing, or input/output operations.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious patterns.\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports.**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward setup for AST analysis, with no malicious intent.\n- They uniformly state that the code is benign, with no anomalies or security risks.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned.**\n\n- All reports assign:\n  - confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - malware: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n\n- These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5.**\n\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or vulnerabilities.\n- The code is purely definitional, serving as constants for AST processing.\n- Therefore, a risk score higher than 0.0 is unwarranted.\n\n**Step 5: Review malware scores.**\n\n- All reports assign malware: 0, which is correct.\n- No malicious activity is present.\n\n**Step 6: Challenge any claims based on assumptions.**\n\n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n- No claims about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made beyond what is evident.\n\n**Step 7: Check consistency of scores with the report.**\n\n- All scores are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.  \n**Risk score:** 0 — no security risk present.\n\n### Additional comments:\n\n- The code is a minimal, static setup for AST node type categorization.\n- It is unlikely to be involved in any supply chain attack or malicious activity.\n- The uniformity and correctness of the reports suggest proper evaluation.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.\n- No changes needed in the scores or analysis.\n- The code is entirely benign with no security concerns.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the code's harmless, static, and utility nature.",
