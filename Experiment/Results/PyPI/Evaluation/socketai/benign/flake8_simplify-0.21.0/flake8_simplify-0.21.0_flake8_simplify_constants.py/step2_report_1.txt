  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the original code, and evaluate the scoring and reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The original code is a set of constant definitions importing the `ast` module and defining tuples of AST node types, intended for static analysis or AST manipulation.\n- No dynamic code execution, input/output, or data handling is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.\n- All reports agree on benign intent and straightforwardness.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n\n**Summary:**\n- Purpose: Define constants for AST node types.\n- Analysis: No suspicious behavior, benign utility module.\n- Score: malware 0, risk 0.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n- The analysis is accurate; the code is purely definitional.\n- The score assignment is appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- No issues; the report is correct.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n\n**Summary:**\n- Purpose: Set up constants for AST node types.\n- Analysis: No data flow, no malicious intent.\n- Score: malware 0, risk 0.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n- Correct; no security concern.\n- The reasoning is sound.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Correct and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n\n**Summary:**\n- Purpose: Define constants for AST nodes related to constants.\n- Analysis: Standard static analysis setup, no malicious behavior.\n- Score: malware 0, risk 0.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n- Accurate; the code is safe.\n- No issues.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Appropriate assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n\n**Summary:**\n- Purpose: Define constants for AST node types related to constants.\n- Analysis: Straightforward, no malicious intent.\n- Score: malware 0, risk 0.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n- Correct; no security issues.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n\n**Summary:**\n- Purpose: Define constants for AST nodes related to constants and strings.\n- Analysis: No suspicious behavior.\n- Score: malware 0, risk 0.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n- Accurate; the code is benign.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code correctness:** All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, static, and utility-oriented.\n- **Malware score:** All are 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent and justified.\n- No adjustments needed.\n- The detailed reasoning aligns with the code's simplicity and purpose.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a benign utility module for AST node type categorization, with no security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's nature.
