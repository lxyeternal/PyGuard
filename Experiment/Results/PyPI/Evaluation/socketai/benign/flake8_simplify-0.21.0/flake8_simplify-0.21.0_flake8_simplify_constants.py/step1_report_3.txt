{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define constants related to AST node types for boolean and constant values, likely for use in analyzing or processing Python source code.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources are present in this fragment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data could cause effects are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs, is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports the 'ast' module and defines three tuples of AST node types for constants. These definitions are standard for source code analysis tasks. There are no dynamic code execution, data leaks, or malicious patterns present. The code does not contain any malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward setup for source code analysis or AST processing, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
