{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up constants for AST node types related to constant values in Python, likely for use in static code analysis or AST manipulation.",
  "sources": "Import of 'ast' module, definition of constant type tuples",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling identified",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data processing observed",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; only constant definitions and imports",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'ast' module and defines tuples grouping AST node types for constants across different Python versions. These constants are standard and intended for static analysis tasks. No user input, external data, or dynamic execution is present. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious intent are detected. The code is straightforward and appears safe.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign, consisting of standard AST node type definitions for use in static analysis. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.",
