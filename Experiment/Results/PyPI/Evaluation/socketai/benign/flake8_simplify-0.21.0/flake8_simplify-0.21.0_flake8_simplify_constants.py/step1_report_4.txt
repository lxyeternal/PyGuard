  "purpose": "Define constants for AST node types related to constant values in Python code.",
  "sources": "Importing the 'ast' module, defining tuples of AST node types.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data output or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "None; the code is purely definitional and does not process data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'ast' module and defines constants that categorize AST nodes representing constant values in Python versions 3.6 through 3.8. These constants are likely intended for use in AST analysis or manipulation, such as static code analysis or code transformation. There are no functions, no input/output operations, and no logic that could be malicious. The code is straightforward and purely definitional.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, intended for AST processing, and contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
