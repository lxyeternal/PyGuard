  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, the reasoning, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code snippets are straightforward, consisting solely of importing the `ast` module and defining tuples of AST node types.\n- There are no functions, no data processing, no dynamic code execution, no input/output operations.\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, serving as utility constants for AST analysis.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Logical Consistency\n\n**Are the reported issues present?**  \nYes. All reports correctly identify that the code is simple and benign, with no malicious intent.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in reasoning?**  \nNo. The reasoning in each report is sound, consistent, and justified by the code content.\n\n**Scores assigned:**  \n- `malware`: 0 in all reports.  \n- `securityRisk`: 0 in all reports.  \n- `obfuscated`: 0 in all reports.  \n- `confidence`: 1 in all reports.\n\nThese scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation of the Scores and Analysis\n\n**Malware Score:**  \nSince the code only defines constants and imports `ast`, with no malicious behavior, a malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:**  \nThe code is straightforward and not obfuscated; score 0 is correct.\n\n**Security Risk Score:**  \nNo vulnerabilities or risky operations are present; score 0 is appropriate.\n\n**Risk Score:**  \nAll reports assign a 0 or very low risk score, which is justified.\n\n**Potential issues with the reports:**\n- The reports do not suggest any hidden or malicious intent.\n- The reasoning is consistent across all reports.\n- The confidence level of 1 is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification and Personal Assessment\n\n**Malware, Obfuscated, and Risk Scores:**  \nGiven the analysis, I would assign the following scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is purely definitional, used for AST analysis, with no dynamic or malicious behavior. The consistent reasoning across reports supports these scores.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n- All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n- No discrepancies or unreasonable scores are evident.\n- The reasoning is sound, and the scores align with the code's simplicity and safety.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the scores at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk. The code is safe, and the reports are accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard utility for AST analysis, with no security concerns. The reports are thorough and accurate, and the scoring reflects the benign nature appropriately.",
