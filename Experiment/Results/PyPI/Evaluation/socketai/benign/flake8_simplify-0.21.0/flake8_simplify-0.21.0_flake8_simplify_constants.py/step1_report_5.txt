{
  "purpose": "The code defines constants for AST node types related to constants and strings, likely used for AST analysis or manipulation.",
  "sources": "import ast statement, defining AST node type tuples",
  "sinks": "None present; no data outputs, network interactions, or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "None; the code only defines constants without data flow or input/output operations",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors detected; code is straightforward and standard for AST processing",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'ast' module and defines several tuples for AST node types representing constants and strings, adjusted for different Python versions. There are no functions, data processing, or external interactions. It appears to be setup code for AST analysis or manipulation, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple setup for AST analysis, defining node type constants without any malicious or suspicious content. It does not perform any input/output, network activity, or sensitive operations. No security concerns are identified.",
