{
  "purpose": "Define constants for AST node types related to constants, strings, and boolean constants for static analysis or AST manipulation.",
  "sources": "Import of the 'ast' module; definitions of tuples grouping AST node classes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static definitions with no dynamic or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'ast' module and defines several tuples of AST node classes, such as 'BOOL_CONST_TYPES', 'AST_CONST_TYPES', and 'STR_TYPES'. These groupings are used for static analysis or AST processing, accommodating different Python versions. The code is purely definitional, with no functions, data processing, or dynamic behavior. No signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks are present. The code's simplicity and purpose are clear, and it does not involve any external data handling or execution flow.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for categorizing AST node types, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All evidence points to its purpose as a static setup for AST analysis, and there are no indicators of supply chain threats or malicious intent.",
