  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code.\n\n**Code Review Summary:**\n- The code imports the `ast` module.\n- Defines several tuples of AST node types, such as `BOOL_CONST_TYPES`, `AST_CONST_TYPES`, and `STR_TYPES`.\n- These tuples group AST node classes related to constants, string constants, and boolean constants, accommodating different Python versions.\n- The code is purely definitional, with no functions, data processing, or dynamic behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code is straightforward and correctly defines constants for AST node types.\n- No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- No data sinks, flows, or external data handling.\n- No signs of security risks or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, intended for use in static analysis or AST manipulation.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Reports:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Assessment:** Correctly states the code is benign, utility for AST node categorization, no malicious intent.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No change needed.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Assessment:** Same as above, focusing on static analysis setup, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Assessment:** Same as above, straightforward AST node type definitions, no dynamic or malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Assessment:** Same as above, benign setup code, no malicious intent.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Assessment:** Same as above, simple AST node type constants, no malicious or suspicious patterns.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- The malware score is correctly set to 0 across all reports, as there's no malicious activity.\n- Obfuscation is correctly scored as 0; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- Security risk is appropriately 0; no vulnerabilities or risky operations are present.\n- The confidence levels are 1, reflecting certainty about benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The current scores are consistent and appropriate.\n- No modifications are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a simple, benign utility module for AST node type definitions, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code. The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code's characteristics. No further action or adjustment is needed.",
