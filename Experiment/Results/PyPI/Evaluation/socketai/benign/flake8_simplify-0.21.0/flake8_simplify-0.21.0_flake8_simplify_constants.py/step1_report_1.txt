  "purpose": "Define constants for specific AST node types used in Python code analysis or transformation.",
  "sources": "Import statement for ast module; definitions of AST node type tuples.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; simple constant definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'ast' module and defines tuples of AST node types for constants, string constants, and boolean constants, to facilitate AST analysis. There are no dynamic code execution, data handling, or security-relevant operations. The code appears to serve as a helper module for other code involving AST manipulation. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is benign, serving as a utility for AST node type categorization without any malicious intent or security risks.",
