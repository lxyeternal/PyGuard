{
  "purpose": "The code analyzes abstract syntax trees (AST) of Python code to identify specific code patterns related to simplification or refactoring suggestions, particularly around boolean expressions.",
  "sources": "The code reads AST nodes representing conditional expressions (ast.IfExp) and uses utility functions to generate source code strings from AST subtrees.",
  "sinks": "The code does not interact with untrusted data sources, external systems, or perform network or file operations.",
  "flows": "The code flows from reading AST nodes (sources) through pattern-matching logic to generate diagnostic messages (sinks).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code is purely for static analysis and refactoring suggestions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules for AST manipulation and defines functions that analyze specific boolean expression patterns within AST nodes. It checks for patterns like 'True if cond else False' and suggests more idiomatic code. All functions perform pattern matching and source code reconstruction without executing any code or interacting with external systems. There is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks, as the code is purely static analysis logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs static AST pattern matching to suggest refactoring improvements. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe, well-structured, and purpose-specific.",
