  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it against the provided code.\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n- The code inspects Python AST nodes to identify specific patterns in conditional expressions.\n- It generates style or refactoring suggestions.\n- It relies on external utilities (`to_source`, `is_same_expression`) which are typical in static analysis tools.\n- No external system interactions, data processing, or malicious behaviors are present.\n- The code appears to be a benign, pattern-matching utility for code style enforcement.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the code analyzes AST nodes for pattern detection.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or I/O, just pattern matching.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior; purely static analysis.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate; the code is safe, straightforward, and intended for style improvements.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0 — reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the static analysis functions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or malicious sinks.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; the code is benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No concerns; the report is consistent.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; the functions analyze boolean patterns.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external interactions.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; static analysis for style suggestions.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0 — reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct assessment.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the code detects specific boolean expression patterns.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or malicious sinks.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate; purely static, style-focused code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; the functions analyze boolean expressions for style improvements.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or system interactions.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious or suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Properly describes the benign, static analysis nature.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of all reports:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a benign static analysis utility.\n- The malware scores are correctly set to 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n- Obfuscation scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- Security risk scores are 0, as there's no external data handling or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is safe, clear, and intended solely for style and pattern detection in Python code. No modifications to the scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior. The code is a benign static analysis tool with no malicious or security concerns.",
