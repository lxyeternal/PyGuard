{
  "purpose": "This code provides static analysis functions for identifying specific code patterns related to conditional expressions in Python, possibly as part of a linter or code quality tool.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from AST nodes representing 'IfExp' expressions, specifically the 'test', 'body', and 'orelse' components, as well as source code conversions via 'to_source'.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs formatted error messages indicating style issues; there are no direct sinks related to untrusted data processing or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The functions analyze AST nodes (sources) to identify patterns and generate error messages (sinks) based on the structure of conditional expressions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious anomalies are present. The code solely performs pattern detection for code style suggestions. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three functions that analyze AST nodes representing conditional expressions to identify style or pattern issues. Each function checks specific structural conditions of the AST nodes and generates error messages with source code snippets. The functions use helper methods for source extraction and expression comparison but do not process untrusted input or perform any network or file operations. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks in this implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static analysis tool component that inspects code patterns for style issues. There is no malicious behavior, security threat, or suspicious activity detected.",
