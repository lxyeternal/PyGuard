  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a benign static analysis utility aimed at detecting specific conditional patterns for style improvements. It notes no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. These seem appropriate given the benign nature.  \n- **Logic & reasoning:** The report is consistent and accurate.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it emphasizes that the code is a static analysis tool with no malicious intent or suspicious behaviors.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. These are appropriate.  \n- **Logic & reasoning:** Correct and consistent.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Assessment:** Again, confirms the code is for static pattern matching, with no malicious or security issues.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.  \n- **Logic & reasoning:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Assessment:** Reiterates that the code is a style-focused static analysis utility, with no malicious or security implications.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Suitable.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion: the code is for static style analysis, safe, and without malicious intent.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious behavior?**  \n  No. The code strictly performs pattern matching on AST nodes for style improvements. No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious logic.\n\n- **Obfuscation?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward and uses standard AST techniques.\n\n- **Security risk?**  \n  None. The code does not process untrusted data, perform I/O, network operations, or execute code dynamically.\n\n- **Malware score justification:**  \n  Given the above, the malware score should be **0**. The reports correctly reflect this.\n\n- **Obfuscated score justification:**  \n  The code is clear and standard; obfuscation score should be **0**.\n\n- **Risk score justification:**  \n  Since there's no malicious activity, security risk is **0**.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- All reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- The scores are reasonable and align with the code's purpose.\n- No changes needed to the scores or reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### Final conclusion:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a safe, static analysis utility with no security or malicious concerns.",
