  "purpose": "Static analysis utility that detects specific boolean expression patterns in Python AST nodes for style improvement suggestions.",
  "sources": "AST nodes representing conditional expressions (ast.IfExp), specifically the test, body, and orelse components.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data, perform I/O, or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "AST node pattern checks flow from the node type and value checks to source code extraction via 'to_source' for reporting.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, uses standard AST techniques, and contains no suspicious or obfuscated constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code analyzes AST nodes for specific boolean patterns: 'True if cond else False', 'False if cond else True', and 'b if not a else a'. It uses utility functions for source extraction and expression comparison. The logic is correct, and the purpose is to suggest style improvements. No malicious or security-related behavior is present. The code is simple, clear, and standard for static analysis tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static analysis utility focused on style suggestions for boolean expressions. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk should all be 0, consistent with the analysis.",
