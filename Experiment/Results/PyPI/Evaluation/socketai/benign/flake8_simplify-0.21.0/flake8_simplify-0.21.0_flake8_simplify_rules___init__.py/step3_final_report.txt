  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Patterns indicating dynamic code execution, obfuscated variables, hardcoded secrets, network/file operations, environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file system access, data exfiltration points, environment variables.",
  "flows": "From suspicious sources (e.g., eval(), exec(), hardcoded secrets) to sinks like network or files, possibly via dynamic code execution or data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic execution functions (`exec()`, `eval()`), obfuscated variable names, hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, lack of comments, missing validation, potential backdoors.",
  "analysis": "Most reports identify patterns such as obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious data flow but lack concrete code evidence. Scores assigned reflect suspicion levels: low malware likelihood (0-0.2), moderate obfuscation (up to 0.3), and moderate security risk (0.2-0.45). The assessments are consistent with cautious interpretations of patterns rather than confirmed malicious activity. Confidence levels are moderate to high, given the absence of explicit code snippets but recognition of suspicious patterns. Overall, the code appears benign but warrants further static/dynamic analysis for confirmation.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows no confirmed malicious behavior; suspicion is limited to patterns like obfuscation and dynamic execution. Scores are appropriately cautious, with low malware probability and moderate security risk due to potential misuse. Further detailed code review is recommended to confirm these assessments.",
