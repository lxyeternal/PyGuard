  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the potential presence of malware, obfuscation, and overall security risk, as well as the correctness and reasoning of their conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is static analysis rules for common Python code issues. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malware detected.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is thorough; the functions check for patterns like unclosed files, improper boolean conversions, string splits, os.path.join misuse, dict.get with None, and zip with keys/values.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** Zero; the code is pattern matching, no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Risk Score Justification:** Given the nature of the code—static analysis rules—there's no risk of malware or obfuscation. The low security risk score (0.0) is justified.\n- **Scores:** The report's assigned scores (malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk=0.0) are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it describes static analysis rules for code quality, no malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent pattern matching functions, no suspicious code.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Risk Score Justification:** The code is purely pattern matching; no external effects or malicious logic.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.0 are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above—static analysis for code style and correctness, no malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of obfuscation or malware; functions are straightforward pattern matchers.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Risk Score Justification:** The code is safe, no malicious activity, so low risk is justified.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Static analysis rules for code quality, no malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** Clear pattern detection, no signs of malicious code.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Risk Score Justification:** The code's purpose is code quality enforcement, not execution of untrusted code or data.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Static analysis rules, similar to others, no malicious intent.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malware or obfuscation; focused on pattern detection.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Risk Score Justification:** The slight mention of `securityRisk=0.1` is probably a default or conservative estimate, but given the benign nature, this is acceptable.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify that there's no malware present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Zero obfuscation is evident; the code is straightforward pattern matching.\n- **Risk Scores:** The low or zero scores are justified, given the code's purpose and structure.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a collection of static analysis functions operating on Python AST nodes.\n- No code executes untrusted data, performs network operations, or manipulates files in a malicious way.\n- No obfuscation or hidden behaviors are present.\n- The pattern matching is standard for linters or code quality tools.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores assigned are appropriate based on the code's nature. No adjustments are necessary.",
