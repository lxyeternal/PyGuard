  "purpose": "Static analysis functions for detecting code patterns such as unclosed files, improper boolean usage, string splits, os.path.join issues, dict.get with None, and zip with keys/values.",
  "sources": "AST nodes representing function calls and attribute access, such as 'open', 'bool', 'split', 'os.path.join', 'dict.get', and 'zip'.",
  "sinks": "None; the code performs pattern matching without executing untrusted data or performing data leaks.",
  "flows": "Pattern matching from source AST nodes to identified issues; no data flow to external systems or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static analysis rules with clear pattern detection.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises static analysis functions that analyze AST nodes for specific code patterns indicative of style or correctness issues. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or data exfiltration are present. The functions operate purely on AST structures, matching patterns like 'open' without context managers, 'bool' conversions, string splits, 'os.path.join' misuse, 'dict.get' with None, and 'zip' with 'keys' and 'values'. The logic is consistent, and the purpose is to enforce code quality. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate given the benign, pattern-matching nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of static analysis rules with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are accurate and justified. No adjustments are necessary.",
