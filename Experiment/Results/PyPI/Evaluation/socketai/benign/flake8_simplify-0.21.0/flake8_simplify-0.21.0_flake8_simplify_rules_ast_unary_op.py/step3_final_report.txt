  "purpose": "Static analysis functions designed to detect stylistic issues involving unary 'not' with comparison operators in Python AST nodes.",
  "sources": "AST nodes representing unary 'not' operations, specifically nodes with 'not' applied to comparison expressions.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only generates warning messages based on pattern detection, with no data flow to external systems or sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "AST nodes are inspected for specific patterns; if matched, a message is generated indicating stylistic improvements.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors are present; the code is straightforward static analysis.",
  "analysis": "The functions correctly identify patterns like 'not (a == b)', 'not (a != b)', 'not (a in b)', and double negations 'not (not a)'. They perform proper type checks and exclude exception checks. The code relies on utility functions like 'to_source' and 'is_exception_check', which are standard for static analysis. No signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or obfuscation are detected. The logic is sound, and the code is purely for style enforcement, with no external interactions or risky operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static analysis utility aimed at style enforcement. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, security risk score of 0, and obfuscated score of 0 are consistent with the code's purpose and implementation.",
