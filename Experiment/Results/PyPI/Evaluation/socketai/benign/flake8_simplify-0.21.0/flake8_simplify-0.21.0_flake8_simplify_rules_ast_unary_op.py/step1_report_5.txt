{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions to analyze Python AST nodes for specific pattern violations related to unary 'not' usage with comparisons, aiming to suggest more idiomatic code patterns.",
  "sources": "The code reads AST nodes representing unary operations, comparisons, and parent nodes to analyze usage patterns.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that handle untrusted input or data leaks. It primarily processes AST nodes for pattern detection and formatting error messages.",
  "flows": "The functions process AST nodes (sources), evaluate conditions, and generate formatted error message tuples (errors). There are no data flows involving untrusted external data or inputs, only internal pattern detection.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code strictly performs static analysis for stylistic code patterns. There are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or hidden functionalities.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple functions to detect specific usages of 'not' in conjunction with comparison operators in Python AST nodes. It verifies node types, parent context, and comparison operators to generate error messages recommending idiomatic replacements. The functions are straightforward, with no dynamic execution, external data handling, or suspicious logic. They serve as static code quality checkers.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a static analysis utility aimed at improving code style related to 'not' usage. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is well-structured and safe. No signs of supply chain sabotage or malicious intent are detected.",
