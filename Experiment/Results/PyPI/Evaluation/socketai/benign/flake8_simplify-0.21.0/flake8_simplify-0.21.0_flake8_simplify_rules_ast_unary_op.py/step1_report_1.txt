{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for static code analysis, specifically to identify stylistic issues related to the usage of unary 'not' with comparison operators, likely for code quality enforcement.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from AST nodes representing code syntax trees, specifically inspecting 'UnaryOp' and 'Compare' nodes.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks for untrusted data or any operations that could lead to data leakage, code injection, or system compromise.",
  "flows": "The functions analyze AST nodes (sources) to generate style violation messages; no data flow to external systems occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward static analysis logic with no suspicious or malicious code. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The functions are designed to identify specific stylistic issues involving unary 'not' usage with comparison operators. They inspect AST nodes for particular patterns, generate messages, and do not perform any unsafe operations. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is purely for static analysis and code style enforcement.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static analysis utility focused on stylistic checks, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any network operations, data collection, or system modifications.",
