{
  "purpose": "This code provides static analysis functions to identify code patterns related to the misuse or redundancy of 'not' in comparison operations, primarily for code quality and style enforcement.",
  "sources": "Functions analyze AST nodes representing unary 'not' operations and comparisons; the source code is parsed into AST and passed into these functions.",
  "sinks": "These functions do not contain typical security sinks like network or file I/O; they generate warnings based on code structure.",
  "flows": "AST node representing 'not' operations flows to these functions, which analyze the structure to produce style suggestions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code solely focuses on pattern detection for style improvements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple pattern matching functions that check for specific usage of 'not' with comparison operators (==, !=, in, not in). Each function verifies the structure of the AST node to identify redundant or stylistically discouraged patterns. The functions are straightforward, utilizing type checks and source code extraction. No malicious behavior or obfuscation techniques are detected. The overall structure is simple and focused on static code style suggestions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of style enforcement functions for static analysis, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It only analyzes AST nodes for specific pattern warnings, with no harmful or malicious behavior present.",
