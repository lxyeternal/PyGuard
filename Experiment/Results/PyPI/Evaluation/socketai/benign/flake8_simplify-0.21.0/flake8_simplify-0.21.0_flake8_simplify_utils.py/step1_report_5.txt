{
  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for analyzing, transforming, and comparing Python Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs), including source code formatting, structural comparison, and pattern detection within AST nodes.",
  "sources": "The code reads AST nodes, source code strings, and certain node attributes such as 'parent' and 'previous_sibling'.",
  "sinks": "Potential data flow endpoints include 'to_source' which converts AST nodes to source code strings, but it only outputs strings; no data is sent to external systems or over the network.",
  "flows": "The functions process AST nodes from sources, perform comparisons or transformations, and produce formatted source code or boolean results; no external sinks (network, file, etc.) involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. The code contains extensive AST manipulation and formatting functions, which are typical for static analysis tools.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom AST node classes with added attributes, utility functions for source code formatting, node comparison, and pattern detection. It performs static analysis and structural comparisons without executing or evaluating code logic at runtime. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are present. The functions operate solely on AST structures or source strings, with no network or system interaction. The purpose appears to be safe static code analysis or refactoring support.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a collection of static analysis and formatting utilities for Python ASTs with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It primarily aids in code analysis and transformation tasks, which are typical in security and code quality tools.",
