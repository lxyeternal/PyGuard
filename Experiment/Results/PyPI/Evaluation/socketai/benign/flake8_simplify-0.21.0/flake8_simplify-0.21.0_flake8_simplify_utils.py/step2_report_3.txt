  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code provides utility functions and custom AST node subclasses for static analysis, code refactoring, or code quality.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external sinks or data flows to untrusted sources; operations are internal.\n- **Anomalies:** The main anomaly is the extension of AST nodes with additional attributes like 'parent' and 'previous_sibling'. These are not part of the standard AST and suggest enhanced navigation or analysis capabilities.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious code. The functions are safe, mainly for static analysis. The high confidence (0.9) and zero malware/security risk scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing AST node extensions and utility functions for source formatting and structural analysis.\n- **Potential concern:** The custom node attributes (parent, previous_sibling) could be used for complex code analysis or transformations.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected. The risk score of 0.1 is reasonable given the utility nature of the code.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on AST analysis, including source conversion, structural comparison, and pattern detection.\n- **Anomalies:** Again, custom subclasses with extra attributes; no malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe static analysis utility with negligible security risk, matching the malware score of 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar assessment: utility functions for AST manipulation, no external data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** Extension of AST nodes with parent/sibling attributes, which could be used for advanced analysis but not malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, low security risk.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Summarizes the above points: static analysis utilities, source formatting, structural comparison.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior; the code is typical for static analysis tools.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malware or malicious intent; risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Code Content & Behavior:** All reports describe code that is primarily for static analysis, code formatting, and AST manipulation. The extension of AST nodes with additional attributes like 'parent' and 'previous_sibling' is unconventional but not malicious—these are often used in AST transformations or analysis tools.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious payloads. The code does not perform any network, file system, or external command operations.\n- **Potential Risks:** The only concern is that the custom AST node subclasses with added attributes could be exploited if combined with malicious inputs or used in an insecure environment, but on its own, this is benign.\n- **Scores Justification:** The malware scores are all zero, which is appropriate. The security risk scores are low (0.1), reflecting minimal concern, which seems reasonable given the code's purpose.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (consistent with reports)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (appropriate, considering the potential for misuse if combined with malicious inputs but not inherently malicious)\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\nGiven the detailed analysis, I agree with the provided scores. The code is a static analysis utility with no malicious intent. Its extension of AST nodes is for advanced code analysis but not suspicious.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis code appears safe and legitimate for static code analysis purposes.",
