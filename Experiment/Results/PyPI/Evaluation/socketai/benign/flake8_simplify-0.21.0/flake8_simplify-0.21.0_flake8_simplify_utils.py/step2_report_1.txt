  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Summary:** The code extends AST nodes with 'parent' and 'previous_sibling' attributes, and provides utility functions for source code formatting, AST comparison, etc.  \n- **Assessment:** No direct sinks, no network or I/O operations, and no malicious payloads are present. The modifications to AST nodes are for static analysis or refactoring.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct, no malicious activity)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (not obfuscated)  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)  \n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on utility functions and AST node extensions. Slight mention of potential misuse of string functions but overall benign.  \n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity, just static analysis utilities. The added attributes could be used for advanced analysis but do not imply malicious intent.  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, primarily because of potential misuse if combined maliciously, but on its own, negligible)  \n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Summary:** Same general purpose—AST utility functions, source code conversion, structural comparison, with added AST node attributes.  \n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious behavior. The extension of AST nodes is for analysis, not malicious activity.  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (again, very low, mainly for potential misuse in a broader context)  \n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Summary:** Utility functions for AST analysis, source formatting, pattern detection. No external data sinks or malicious code.  \n- **Assessment:** The code is a static analysis utility, with no malicious intent. The AST node extensions are for analysis purposes.  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0  \n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports—AST analysis, formatting, comparison, with no malicious behavior.  \n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity; utility functions are safe.  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0  \n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code presence of malware or malicious activity:** None detected across all reports.  \n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation techniques or suspicious code patterns.  \n- **Security risk:** The code is purely static analysis utilities with no external system interaction, data exfiltration, or code injection points. The minor risk scores (0.1) are just precautionary and reflect potential misuse if combined with malicious inputs, but on their own, they are safe.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n| Category             | Estimated Score |\n|----------------------|-----------------|\n| **Malware**        | **0**             |\n| **Obfuscated**     | **0**             |\n| **Risk**           | **0** (or very close to 0) |\n\n**Note:** Given the consistent pattern across all reports, the code appears to be a benign static analysis utility designed for code structure inspection, refactoring, or tooling support.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, with no evidence of malicious intent or activity. The slight security risk scores are overly cautious and justified only if misused externally, but in isolation, they pose no threat.",
