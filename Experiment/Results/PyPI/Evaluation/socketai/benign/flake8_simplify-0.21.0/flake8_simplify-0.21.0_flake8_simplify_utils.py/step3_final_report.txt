  "purpose": "Static analysis utilities for Python AST manipulation, including source code conversion, structural comparison, and AST node extension for navigation.",
  "sources": "AST nodes during analysis, string inputs for formatting functions",
  "sinks": "None; no external data or network operations",
  "flows": "AST nodes and source strings processed within functions; no external untrusted data flow",
  "anomalies": "Extension of standard AST node classes with additional attributes ('parent', 'previous_sibling') for enhanced navigation",
  "analysis": "The code provides helper classes and functions for static analysis, code formatting, and AST comparison. No network, file, or system interactions are present. The custom AST subclasses facilitate advanced analysis but do not introduce malicious behavior. String manipulation functions are for formatting and are safe. The extension of AST nodes is typical for analysis tools and not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static analysis utility with no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The modifications to AST nodes serve analysis purposes and do not pose security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 are consistent and appropriate.",
