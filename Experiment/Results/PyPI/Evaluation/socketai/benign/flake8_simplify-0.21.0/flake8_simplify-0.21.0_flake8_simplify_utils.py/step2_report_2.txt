  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, code logic, and consistency of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes utility functions for AST analysis and string formatting.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external sinks or data flows involving untrusted data.\n- **Anomalies:** Custom AST subclasses with 'parent' and 'previous_sibling' attributes, which are not standard but used for navigation.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity; functions are for static analysis and code formatting.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, benign utility code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent with analysis.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues. The low scores are justified. The code appears purely for static analysis without malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar utility functions, focusing on AST analysis.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or network operations.\n- **Anomalies:** Same extension of AST nodes with parent/previous_sibling attributes; potential for complex analysis but not malicious.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, just static analysis utilities.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, with a very low security risk (0.1) possibly due to the potential for misuse if combined with malicious inputs.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — reasonable.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious activity. Slightly higher risk score due to potential misuse, but overall safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for AST comparison and analysis.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data sinks.\n- **Anomalies:** Same custom AST subclasses with added attributes; no suspicious behavior.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious intent, just static analysis tools.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, very low security risk.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — consistent.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; scores justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar utility functions for AST analysis.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external sinks.\n- **Anomalies:** Same extension of AST nodes, no malicious behavior.\n- **Analysis:** Utility functions for static analysis, safe.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity, low risk.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — justified.\n\n**Assessment:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** AST analysis utilities.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data sinks.\n- **Anomalies:** Same custom AST subclasses; no malicious intent.\n- **Analysis:** Safe static analysis code.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity, risk=0.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the code's straightforward nature.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports, justified by the fact that extending AST nodes with additional attributes could potentially be misused if combined with malicious inputs, but this is a low concern here.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 is reasonable given the potential for misuse, but overall, the code is safe.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to potential misuse if combined with malicious inputs, but not inherently risky)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a benign static analysis utility for Python ASTs. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
