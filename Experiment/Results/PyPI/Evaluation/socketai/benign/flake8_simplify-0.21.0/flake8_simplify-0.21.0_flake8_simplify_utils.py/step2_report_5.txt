  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the findings with the code, and assess the potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report describes the code as utility functions and class extensions for static analysis, with no malicious activity. It emphasizes that the code adds 'parent' and 'previous_sibling' attributes to AST nodes to facilitate navigation, and performs string formatting and structural comparisons.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The code indeed extends AST node classes with additional attributes (`parent`, `previous_sibling`), which are not part of the standard AST. This could be used for more advanced analysis or transformations.\n  - The functions operate on AST nodes, converting them to source code, comparing structures, and detecting patterns like duplicated `isinstance` calls.\n  - No network, file I/O, or data exfiltration activities are present.\n  - The string manipulation functions (`strip_parenthesis`, `strip_triple_quotes`, `use_double_quotes`) are for formatting, not malicious obfuscation.\n  - The overall conclusion that this is a static analysis utility with no malicious intent appears accurate.\n\n- **Score justification:** The malware score of 0 is appropriate. The obfuscated score of 0 is also justified, as the code is transparent. The security risk is minimal, given the lack of external interactions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing static analysis, AST extension, and string formatting functions. It notes the potential for misuse if combined with malicious inputs but finds no evidence of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The code's extension of AST nodes with parent and sibling links is consistent.\n  - No data sinks like network or file operations.\n  - The functions are general utilities for code analysis, not executing or transmitting data.\n  - The potential for misuse exists only if combined with malicious external code, but on its own, it's benign.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware remains at 0, obfuscated at 0, security risk very low (0.1). This aligns well with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code is for static analysis, with no external data sources or sinks, and no malicious behavior. It highlights the extension of AST classes and utility functions.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The code's modifications to AST nodes are for analysis purposes.\n  - No network or file system activity.\n  - The functions are safe and typical for static analysis tools.\n\n- **Score justification:** The malware score of 0 is appropriate, and obfuscated remains 0. Security risk is negligible.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the lack of malicious behavior, with AST extensions and utility functions for code comparison and formatting.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - No signs of malicious activity.\n  - The extension of AST nodes with additional attributes is for analysis.\n  - No network, file, or system operations.\n\n- **Score justification:** Consistent with prior assessments; malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, minimal security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report confirms the code as static analysis utilities with no malicious intent, focusing on code formatting, structural comparison, and pattern detection.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The code's purpose aligns with static analysis.\n  - No external data flows or system interactions.\n  - The extension of AST nodes is for analysis, not malicious activity.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, security risk = 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree that the code is benign, with no malicious payloads, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is transparent, with no obfuscation techniques.\n- **Security Risk:** The code is a utility library for static analysis, with no external interactions or vulnerabilities.\n\n### **Final Expert Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — Very low, primarily because the code could be misused if combined with malicious inputs, but on its own, it is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a static analysis utility for Python ASTs, with no malicious behavior or security concerns. The provided scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
