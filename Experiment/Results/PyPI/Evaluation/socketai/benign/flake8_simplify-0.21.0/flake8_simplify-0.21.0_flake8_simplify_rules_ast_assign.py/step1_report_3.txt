{
  "purpose": "This code provides static analysis rules for a linter to identify specific code patterns related to dictionary initialization and reflexive assignments in Python code.",
  "sources": "Reads input from AST nodes representing assignment statements (`ast.Assign`), including sibling nodes and parent class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data leaks are present; the code solely analyzes AST nodes for patterns.",
  "flows": "The analysis flows from AST assignment nodes through checks for specific patterns like dictionary initialization and reflexivity, with no data being transmitted externally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hidden code, or obfuscated code present. The code functions as static pattern detection rules with clear logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: `get_sim904` detects cases where dictionaries are initialized with separate assignment statements instead of inline, and `get_sim909` identifies reflexive assignments (e.g., variable assigned to itself). Both functions parse AST nodes, verify node patterns, and generate warnings if patterns are detected. The code uses standard AST node checks and utility functions. No malicious behaviors or suspicious constructs are identified. The code is straightforward, static, and intended for code quality enforcement without external effects or data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements static analysis rules for common Python coding patterns and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and solely focused on code style and correctness enforcement.",
