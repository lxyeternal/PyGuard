  "purpose": "Static analysis functions to detect dictionary initialization patterns and reflexive assignments in Python AST nodes.",
  "sources": "AST nodes representing assignments, including target variables and assigned values.",
  "sinks": "No external data, network, or runtime effects; pattern detection only.",
  "flows": "Analysis of AST node structure to identify specific code patterns; no data flow to external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code; straightforward pattern matching, no obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions that analyze AST assignment nodes for specific anti-patterns: initializing dictionaries via separate assignments and reflexive variable assignments. Both functions perform structural checks on AST nodes, relying on utility functions for source extraction and variable usage analysis. No dynamic code execution, external data handling, or malicious behaviors are present. The functions serve static code quality purposes, with no security implications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign static analysis utility code, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The provided reports correctly identify the code's purpose and safety, assigning appropriate scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
