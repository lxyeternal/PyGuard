  "purpose": "Test setup for Singer tap features using SDK testing library with sample configuration including hardcoded credentials.",
  "sources": "Configuration dictionary 'SAMPLE_CONFIG' with hardcoded 'start_date', 'username', 'password', and 'api_url_base'.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data flows; primarily internal test execution.",
  "flows": "Test functions invoke 'get_standard_tap_tests' with the configuration, executing test cases internally.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded credentials ('test'/'test') and a comment indicating a hacky API mocking workaround; no malicious or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward testing script for a Singer tap, importing testing utilities, defining a sample configuration with insecure hardcoded credentials, and executing tests. No malicious behavior, network activity, or obfuscation is evident. The primary security concern is the insecure handling of credentials, which is typical in test environments but should be replaced with secure secrets management for production. The code is simple, readable, and free of suspicious constructs or obfuscation. The malware score is correctly set to 0, as there is no malicious intent. The obfuscated score is 0, reflecting clear code. The security risk score is slightly elevated (~0.2-0.3) due to insecure credentials but remains low overall, consistent with a benign testing script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test setup with insecure practices typical of development environments. No malicious or obfuscated activity is present. The low security risk score appropriately reflects the insecure credential handling, which should be addressed before production deployment.",
