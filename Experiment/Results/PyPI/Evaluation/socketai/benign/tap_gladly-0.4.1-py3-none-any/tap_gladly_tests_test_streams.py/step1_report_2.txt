{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the tap_gladly SDK features, validating data processing logic and stream behaviors.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration data (SAMPLE_CONFIG), environment variables, and test input data.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data directly; tests mostly operate on mock data and in-memory structures.",
  "flows": "Test functions create instances of streams and invoke post_process and get_records methods using controlled data; no external data flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets are benign, and no obfuscated code or malicious behaviors are present. The only sensitive info is in test data, which is safe.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of unit tests verifying correct processing of data timestamps, content types, and job context filtering within the SDK. It uses mock data and standard testing practices. No external or untrusted data sources are processed. There are no signs of malicious activity, data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network operations. All configurations are test placeholders, and no secrets or credentials are hardcoded beyond typical test data. Overall, the code is straightforward, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for testing SDK functionalities without any malicious or maliciously-inclined behavior. It does not contain any security risks, malware, or obfuscation. It appears to be standard test code with no concerning elements.",
