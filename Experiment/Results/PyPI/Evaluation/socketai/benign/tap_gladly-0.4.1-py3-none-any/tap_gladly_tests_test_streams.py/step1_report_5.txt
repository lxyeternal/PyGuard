  "purpose": "Unit tests for the tap_gladly SDK, verifying data processing, filtering, and record retrieval logic.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from test case definitions and mock return values; configuration data from constants and datetime functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data handling or external data leakage points; no data written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Test data flows from test case variables through class methods, with no untrusted source-to-sink pathways.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscated code; straightforward test logic.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard unit tests for data filtering and date-based record retrieval in a Python SDK. It uses mock objects to simulate external data fetching. There are no indications of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful payloads. All data processing appears benign and relevant to testing functionality. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or risky code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for testing purposes, contains no malicious behavior, and does not introduce security risks. It adheres to standard testing practices without suspicious anomalies.",
