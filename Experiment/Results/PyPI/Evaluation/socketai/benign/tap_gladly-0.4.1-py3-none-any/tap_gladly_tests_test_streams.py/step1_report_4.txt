  "purpose": "Unit tests for the tap_gladly SDK, verifying stream behaviors and data processing logic.",
  "sources": "Config data (SAMPLE_CONFIG), mock inputs, and test data within test functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; test assertions and mock returns do not send data externally.",
  "flows": "Test data flows through post_process methods and get_records with mock data, no external data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. No hardcoded secrets beyond generic credentials, which are standard for tests.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises test functions verifying SDK stream behaviors. No use of external inputs beyond controlled test data; mock.patch used appropriately. No suspicious data leaks, backdoors, or malicious code. No indications of code injection, data exfiltration, or unsafe operations. The credentials in SAMPLE_CONFIG are placeholders for testing purposes. Overall, the code is standard testing code with no malicious intent or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of unit tests with no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks identified. It does not perform any harmful actions or data exfiltration; it solely tests the SDK's functionality.",
