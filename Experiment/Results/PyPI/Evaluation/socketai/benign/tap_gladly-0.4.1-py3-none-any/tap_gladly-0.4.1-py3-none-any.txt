      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard Singer tap setup with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain security issues. The only minor concern is a documentation typo, which does not affect security. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1), primarily due to handling sensitive configuration data but without any malicious activity."

The low security risk score appropriately reflects the insecure credential handling, which should be addressed before production deployment."
