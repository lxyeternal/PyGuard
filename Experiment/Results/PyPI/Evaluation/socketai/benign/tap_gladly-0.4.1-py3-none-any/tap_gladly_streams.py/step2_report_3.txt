  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores:\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as classes for exporting data, reading configuration, and API responses.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows through JSON parsing, filtering, and yielding. No suspicious data sinks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The code is standard for data extraction.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The conclusion states no malicious activity, with high confidence (0.95).\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal, given the code's purpose.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard data extraction, JSON parsing, and filtering based on configuration.  \n- No suspicious activity, no obfuscation, and no hardcoded secrets.  \n- Confidence is slightly lower (0.9), but still high.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 — consistent with the analysis.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 — still low, given the nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Again, similar pattern: data extraction, filtering, schema handling, no malicious behavior observed.  \n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but no red flags.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Same pattern, standard data extraction, response parsing, filtering, no suspicious code.  \n- High confidence (0.9).\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Consistent with others: data flows from API responses, no suspicious code, no obfuscation, standard libraries.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature. No malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated:** All are 0, matching the straightforward, readable code.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above 0, reflecting low but non-zero potential risks due to reliance on external APIs and configuration inputs, but no specific vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The current scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- Since no malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present, I would not suggest increasing any scores.\n- The confidence levels are appropriate, given the code's clarity and purpose.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (low, due to external dependencies and configuration reliance, but no evident security issues)\n\n**Conclusion:** The current scores are appropriate and should remain as is.",
