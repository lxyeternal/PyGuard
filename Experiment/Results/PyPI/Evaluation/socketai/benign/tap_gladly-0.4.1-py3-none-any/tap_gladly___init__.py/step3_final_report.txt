  "purpose": "The code contains only a string literal 'Tap Gladly.' with no executable logic or data flow.",
  "sources": "No data sources; the code is a simple string literal.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data processing or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code does not process or transmit data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is trivial, containing only a string literal with no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a non-functional string literal, with no sources, sinks, or data flows. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. There are no indications of malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. The code is benign and does not pose any security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, trivial, and non-executable. All assessments and scores are accurate and aligned with the content. No further action or concern is warranted.",
