{
  "purpose": "Extend the module search path for package namespace support",
  "sources": "__path__ and __name__ variables, and the import of 'pkgutil'",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data sinks or outputs present",
  "flows": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and modifies '__path__' by extending it with 'extend_path' method",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; straightforward namespace extension",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkgutil' module to modify the '__path__' variable by extending it with 'extend_path', a common pattern in namespace packages. It does not process external input, perform network operations, or handle sensitive data. The code is minimal, standard, and intended for package structure support.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for supporting namespace packages in Python. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
