  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the same core code: `__path__ = __import__(\"pkgutil\").extend_path(__path__, __name__)`.\n- The code pattern is a common, well-understood method for supporting namespace packages in Python.\n- All reports agree that the code is standard, benign, and does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or handle secrets.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, and the obfuscated, malware, and securityRisk scores are all 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the code's correctness and safety:\n- The code imports `pkgutil` dynamically using `__import__`, then calls `extend_path()` on `__path__` with `__name__`. This is a standard pattern for namespace packages.\n- There are no data sinks, no untrusted data, no network activity, no obfuscation, and no signs of malicious behavior.\n- The code is minimal, straightforward, and aligns with best practices for namespace package support.\n\n### Logical and reasoning issues:\n- No issues detected. The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- The code does not contain any hidden or malicious logic, nor does it rely on assumptions that could be challenged.\n\n### Score assessments:\n- All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- The purpose and analysis are accurate and supported by the code.\n\n### Final evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**The code is a standard, safe pattern for namespace package support.**\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **The code is legitimate and safe.**\n- **No changes needed in the scoring or analysis.**\n- **All reports are consistent with the code's intent and behavior.**\n\n**My final estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the consensus and the technical analysis.",
