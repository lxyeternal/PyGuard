{
  "purpose": "Extend the module's search path for package discovery, typically used for namespace packages.",
  "sources": "Imports the 'pkgutil' module using __import__ and accesses __path__ and __name__ variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no data or untrusted input is processed or output.",
  "flows": "Imports 'pkgutil', then extends __path__ using extend_path, which is a standard package initialization operation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' dynamically, then extends the package's __path__ attribute, a common pattern in namespace package initialization. It does not process user input or data from external sources. There are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The code is minimal and standard for package namespace extension.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a typical namespace package setup without any malicious intent or security issues. It simply extends the package search path, a common and benign operation.",
