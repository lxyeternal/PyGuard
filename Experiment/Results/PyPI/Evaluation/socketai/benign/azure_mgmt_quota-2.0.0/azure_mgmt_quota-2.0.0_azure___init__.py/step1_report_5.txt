{
  "purpose": "Extend the current package's __path__ for namespace package support.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and uses __import__ to load it dynamically, then calls extend_path with __path__ and __name__.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that handle untrusted data or could leak information.",
  "flows": "The code dynamically loads a module and modifies __path__, which influences package module loading behavior.",
  "anomalies": "The use of __import__ with a string and extend_path is standard for namespace packages; no unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports 'pkgutil' using __import__, then extends the __path__ variable, typically to support namespace packages. This pattern is common and legitimate, with no evidence of malicious intent. No data leakage, no suspicious data handling, and no external communication is involved.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard operation related to namespace packages. There is no malicious behavior or security risk detected. It is a typical pattern in Python packaging modules.",
