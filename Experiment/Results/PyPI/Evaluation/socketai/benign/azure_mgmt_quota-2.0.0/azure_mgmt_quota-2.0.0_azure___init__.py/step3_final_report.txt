{
  "purpose": "Support namespace package functionality by extending the __path__ attribute dynamically.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __path__ variable and imports the 'pkgutil' module using __import__.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or handle secrets.",
  "flows": "Import 'pkgutil' -> call 'extend_path' on __path__ with __name__ -> assign back to __path__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, secrets, or suspicious behaviors; the code is a standard pattern for namespace packages.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports 'pkgutil' and extends __path__ for namespace package support, a common and benign pattern. It involves no untrusted input, network activity, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify this pattern as standard and safe. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the benign nature of the code. No issues or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation for namespace package support in Python. It poses no security risk or malicious behavior. All reports are accurate and appropriately scored. No modifications are necessary.",
