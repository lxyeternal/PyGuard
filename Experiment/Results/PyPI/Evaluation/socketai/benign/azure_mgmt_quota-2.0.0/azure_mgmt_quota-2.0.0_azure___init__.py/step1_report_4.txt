{
  "purpose": "Extend the package's search path for module discovery, typically used for namespace packages.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and uses '__path__' and '__name__' built-in variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves the 'pkgutil' module, then extends '__path__' with '__name__', updating the package's search path.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal anomaly; the use of extend_path is standard for namespace packages. No suspicious or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and extends the module's '__path__' attribute for namespace package support, which is common in Python packages designed to split code across multiple distributions. No hardcoded secrets, network operations, or malicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward and typical for certain package structures.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard pattern for supporting namespace packages in Python. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks.",
