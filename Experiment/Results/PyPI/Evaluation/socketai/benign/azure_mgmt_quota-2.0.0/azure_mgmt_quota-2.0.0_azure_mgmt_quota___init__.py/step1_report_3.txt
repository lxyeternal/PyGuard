{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be an auto-generated SDK module for managing quotas, providing class imports and version management for a larger library.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module version from '_version' and attempts to import patch modules conditionally.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any untrusted data sinks; it only performs imports, variable assignments, and module initializations.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to importing modules and assigning variables without any user input or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or dynamic code execution present. Use of try-except for optional import is normal.",
  "analysis": "The code is standard for auto-generated SDK modules, with safe import statements and version handling. No signs of malicious behavior or suspicious activity. No obfuscation or code injection mechanisms observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign auto-generated SDK module with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It solely handles module imports and version information.",
