  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\nAll five reports consistently describe the code as a standard, auto-generated SDK module responsible for import management, versioning, and patching. They emphasize that there are no suspicious patterns, no data leaks, no network activity, and no malicious behavior. The confidence levels are high (mostly 1.0), and all reports agree that the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of code:** The code matches the description—standard module setup with imports, version info, and optional patching.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of malware, data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated malicious code.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** No apparent vulnerabilities, such as hardcoded secrets or insecure practices.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors or mistakes are evident; the code is typical for SDK initialization.\n\n### Scores Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, generated nature of the code.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign very low or zero risk, which aligns with the benign analysis.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n- The code performs only module setup tasks, with no external data processing or network calls.\n- The conditional import pattern is standard and not suspicious.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The code is typical of auto-generated SDK modules, which are generally safe.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies:\n- The fourth report assigns a slightly higher `securityRisk` score of 0.1, citing the use of dynamic import and patching. However, this is standard practice and not inherently risky. This minor score could be justified if we consider that dynamic import mechanisms, if misused, could pose risks, but in this context, it's benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Overall, the code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks.** It is a typical SDK initialization script generated by a tool, following best practices for import management and version control.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to the dynamic import pattern, but this is minimal and standard in SDKs)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. No changes are necessary. The code is safe, with no malicious intent or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Keep malware score at 0.\n- Obfuscated score at 0.\n- Risk score at 0.1, reflecting the standard dynamic import pattern but considering it safe in this context.\n\n**This comprehensive review confirms the code is benign and poses no security threat.**",
