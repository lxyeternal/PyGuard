  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the original code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Summary:** Correctly identifies the code as a module setup script for an SDK, with no suspicious or malicious activity.  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code only manages imports, versioning, and patching, with no external data processing or network activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0 — appropriate.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard SDK initialization and patching without malicious intent.  \n- **Assessment:** The analysis is accurate; no suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors are evident.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0 — appropriate.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Summary:** Again, describes a typical auto-generated SDK module with safe import patterns.  \n- **Assessment:** No issues found; the code is standard for such modules.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0 — appropriate.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Summary:** Highlights module import management, versioning, and patching, noting no malicious activity.  \n- **Assessment:** The analysis is thorough and reasonable; the use of conditional imports and patching is standard practice.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.1 — slightly elevated but still very low; justified given the dynamic import logic, which is common in SDKs but could theoretically be misused if misconfigured.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Summary:** Focuses on the benign nature of the code, with no signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct; the code is typical SDK setup code.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0 — appropriate.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on zero, and the code contains no malicious logic, network activity, or suspicious behavior.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is clear, with no obfuscation or dynamic code execution beyond standard conditional imports.  \n- **Risk Score:** Given the lack of any suspicious activity, the overall risk remains very low. The only minor point is the conditional import pattern, which is standard but could be misused in a malicious context. However, in this context, it is normal SDK practice.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a standard, auto-generated SDK initialization script.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The slight security risk score (0.1) assigned in one report is acceptable due to the dynamic import pattern, but overall, the risk remains negligible.\n\n### **My overall estimates:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (to reflect the conditional import pattern, but not a real security concern)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, with no malicious or security-compromising features.",
