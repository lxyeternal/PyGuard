  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The risk score is very low (0.1) due to the dynamic import pattern, but this is standard practice and not indicative of malicious behavior."
