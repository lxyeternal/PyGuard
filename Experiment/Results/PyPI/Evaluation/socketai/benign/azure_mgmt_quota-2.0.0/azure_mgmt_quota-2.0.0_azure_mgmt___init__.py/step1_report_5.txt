{
  "purpose": "Extend the module's search path for package resource loading",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'pkgutil' module and calls extend_path on __path__ with __name__",
  "sinks": "No sinks involved; no untrusted data handling or external data flows",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from source to sink",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for package resource extension; no suspicious or unusual behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkgutil' module and uses extend_path to modify __path__, enabling the package to include resources from multiple directories or distribution layers. This is a common pattern in namespace packages and does not involve any malicious activity. There are no hardcoded secrets, external network calls, or obfuscated elements. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard Python package practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, non-malicious pattern for namespace package support. No malware or security risks are present.",
