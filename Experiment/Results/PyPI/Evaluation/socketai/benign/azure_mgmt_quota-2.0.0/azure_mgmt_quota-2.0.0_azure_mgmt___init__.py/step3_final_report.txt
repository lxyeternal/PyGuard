  "purpose": "Support for namespace packages via extend_path in pkgutil",
  "sources": "Importing __path__ and __name__, calling pkgutil.extend_path",
  "sinks": "None; no data sinks or external data flows",
  "flows": "Import __path__ and __name__, extend __path__ with pkgutil.extend_path",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward and standard",
  "analysis": "The code imports pkgutil dynamically and extends __path__ for namespace package support. It involves no untrusted input, network activity, or data leakage. All reports correctly identify this pattern as benign and standard. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is minimal, clear, and widely used in Python packaging. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are justified with high confidence.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign pattern for namespace package extension with no security concerns or malicious intent. All reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate.",
