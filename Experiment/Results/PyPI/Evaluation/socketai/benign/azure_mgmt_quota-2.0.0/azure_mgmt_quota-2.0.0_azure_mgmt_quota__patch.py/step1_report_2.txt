{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a template or placeholder for customizing a generated SDK or code package, primarily providing documentation and a patching function.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present as the code does not perform any data processing or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious or unusual constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements. The patch_sdk function is a placeholder with no implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard template with no input reading, data processing, or external interactions. It includes a licensing comment, a docstring, a type annotation for __all__, and a no-op patch_sdk function. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security issues. The purpose is to serve as a customization point for SDK modifications, which is typical and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign SDK customization template with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply provides a structure for future modifications. No security concerns are identified.",
