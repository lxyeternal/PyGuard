{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a template for customizing generated SDK code from Microsoft Azure, providing a placeholder for user modifications and a function for applying patches.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the module import statements, comments, and the `patch_sdk()` function definition.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code does not perform any data output or external communication.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input to critical functions or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a minimal template with standard licensing comments, no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code contains licensing information, a docstring, an import statement, an empty list for public API exposure, and a single function `patch_sdk()` with no implementation. It appears to be a standard, safe template for SDK customization, with no malicious intent, no handling of untrusted data, and no suspicious patterns. There are no signs of backdoors, secret leaks, or malicious payloads. The code is straightforward and follows standard patterns for SDK customization points.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign template for SDK customization with no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is safe to use and review further if integrated into larger codebases.",
