  "purpose": "This code appears to serve as a template or customization stub for a Python SDK generated by Microsoft, allowing for future modifications or patches to the SDK behavior.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; the code imports 'List' from typing and defines a function and a list for public API exposure.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or perform operations with potential security implications.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely structural and informational.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, well-structured, and includes licensing and copyright notices. It contains no unusual language features or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard template for SDK customization, containing no executable logic beyond defining a placeholder function and a public API list. It does not process data, perform network operations, or include any malicious code or obfuscated segments.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign template for SDK customization with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is purely structural and intended for user modifications.",
