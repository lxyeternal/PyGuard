  "purpose": "Template for SDK customization, providing a placeholder function for user modifications.",
  "sources": "No data sources; code contains only a licensing comment, a docstring, an import, an empty list, and a no-op function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; code does not process or output data, nor perform external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code does not read or write untrusted data or perform any operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, benign template intended for user customization. It contains no data processing, external communication, or dynamic logic. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: mostly 0, with one at 0.1) are appropriate; the slight elevation in one report is conservative but acceptable. Given the benign nature, the security risk should be 0, and the malware and obfuscated scores are correctly 0.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, structural SDK template with no malicious intent or security issues. The reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scores are consistent with the code content. The minor security risk score of 0.1 can be adjusted to 0 for precision, but it is acceptable as is.",
