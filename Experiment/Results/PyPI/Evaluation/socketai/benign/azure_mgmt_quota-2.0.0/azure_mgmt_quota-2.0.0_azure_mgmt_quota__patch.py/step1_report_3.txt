  "purpose": "This code appears to be a template or stub for customizing an SDK, likely related to Azure SDK code generation.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only defines a function and imports typing.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present as there is no processing or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs; the code consists of definitions and comments without runtime logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains standard comments, licensing info, and a placeholder function with no active logic. No suspicious or unusual code segments are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and appears to be boilerplate for SDK customization. It does not include any data processing, user input, or external interactions. The 'patch_sdk' function is a placeholder for future modifications but currently does nothing. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a template or scaffold for SDK customization. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
