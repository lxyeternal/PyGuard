  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a template or placeholder for SDK customization.\n- The code is minimal, with no data processing, external communication, or dynamic behavior.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- The purpose is to provide a safe scaffold for user modifications.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code matches the descriptions; it contains only a licensing comment, a docstring, an import, an empty list, and a no-op function.\n   - No vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or obfuscation are evident.\n   - **Confirmed:** No issues or malicious code are present.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as benign, minimal, and safe.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are apparent.\n   - The analysis aligns well with the code content.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as zero or near zero, which is appropriate.\n   - The only exception is report 4, which assigns a securityRisk of 0.1. Given the code's benign nature, this seems slightly overestimated but still within a conservative margin.\n   - **Recommendation:** Keep the scores as they are; no adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign scores above 0.5 for malware or security risk.\n   - The highest is 0.1, which is reasonable given the code's simplicity.\n   - **Conclusion:** No justification for higher scores; the current scores are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.\n   - The code does not perform any network, file, or system operations.\n   - **Confirmed:** Malware score should remain 0.\n\n6. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as a safe template.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - The slight securityRisk score of 0.1 in report 4 is acceptable but could be standardized to 0 for clarity.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk, or at most 0.1 in one report, which is negligible)\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a benign, standard template for SDK customization with no security issues or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code content.\n\n**Summary of recommended scores:**\n\n| Score Type     | Recommended Value | Justification                                              |\n|----------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0                   | No malicious activity detected                               |\n| Obfuscated     | 0                   | No obfuscation present                                       |\n| Security Risk  | 0                   | No security risk; minimal template code                     |\n\n**Final note:** The reports are accurate and cautious, correctly identifying the code as safe. No further action is necessary.",
