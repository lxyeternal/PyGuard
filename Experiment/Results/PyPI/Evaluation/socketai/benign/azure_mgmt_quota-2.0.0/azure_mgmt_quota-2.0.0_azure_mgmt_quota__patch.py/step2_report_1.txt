  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n\n- The code is a minimal, well-structured template for SDK customization.\n- It contains no data processing, external communication, or dynamic logic.\n- It has no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious constructs.\n- The purpose appears to be providing a placeholder for future user modifications.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** The code does not contain any executable logic beyond defining an empty list and a placeholder function. It is benign.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors or flaws are present; the code is straightforward.\n- **Malware and obfuscation:** Both are absent; scores of 0 are appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** Very low; the code does not process data or perform external operations. The assigned score of 0.1 in report 4 seems slightly conservative but acceptable given the context as a template.\n\n---\n\n### Specific review of each report:\n\n#### Reports 1-5:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as a benign, structural template.\n- Their reasoning is consistent and accurate.\n- The assigned scores for malware (0), obfuscated (0), and security risk (mostly 0, with a slight 0.1 in report 4) are reasonable.\n- No report claims or implies malicious intent, and none is supported by the code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, correct.\n- **Risk score:** Given the code's benign nature, scores of 0 or very close to 0 are appropriate. Report 4's 0.1 is slightly conservative but acceptable.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- **Risk score adjustment:** I would keep the risk score at 0 for all reports, as there's no potential for harm.\n- **Malware and obfuscated scores:** remain at 0.\n- **Justification:** The code is purely structural, with no data handling, external communication, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n| Score Type      | Recommended Value | Justification                                              |\n|-----------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0                   | No malicious code or behavior present                       |\n| Obfuscated      | 0                   | Clear, straightforward code without obfuscation            |\n| Security Risk   | 0                   | No data processing, external communication, or vulnerabilities |\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is a benign SDK customization template with no security concerns. The scores assigned are reasonable, though a risk score of 0 would be more precise than 0.1 in one report.\n\n**Final note:** Given the code's nature, I agree with the reports' overall conclusions and recommend maintaining the scores at zero for malware and obfuscation, with a risk score of 0.\n\n---\n\n**Work completed step-by-step.**",
