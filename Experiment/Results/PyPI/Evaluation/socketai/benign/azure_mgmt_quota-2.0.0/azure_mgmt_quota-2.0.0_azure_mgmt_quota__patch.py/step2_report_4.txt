  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a minimal, well-structured template intended for SDK customization.\n- It contains no data processing, input/output operations, or external communications.\n- There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs.\n- The purpose is clearly to serve as a placeholder or scaffold for future user modifications.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code, with high confidence (1).\n\n**Specific points:**\n- No data sources, sinks, or flows are present.\n- The only functional element is a placeholder `patch_sdk()` function, which does nothing.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are identified.\n- The security risk score is consistently low (mostly 0, with one report at 0.1), which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports. This is correct; no malicious behavior is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all reports. Correct; code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** Mostly 0, with one report at 0.1. Given the code's benign and structural nature, a risk score of 0 is justified. The 0.1 could be a conservative placeholder, but it's acceptable to keep it at 0.\n\n**Potential issues or assumptions:**\n- No issues are identified with the code itself.\n- The reports correctly identify the code as a safe template.\n- No modifications or malicious payloads are present or implied.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The overall assessment aligns with the reports: this code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final estimated scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis reflects the code's purpose as a safe, structural template for SDK customization, with no security concerns.",
