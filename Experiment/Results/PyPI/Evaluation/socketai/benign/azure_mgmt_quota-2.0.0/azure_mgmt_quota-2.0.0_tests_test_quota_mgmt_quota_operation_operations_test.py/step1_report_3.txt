  "purpose": "Unit testing code for Azure Quota Management Client, specifically listing quota operations.",
  "sources": "Import statements (pytest, azure.mgmt.quota, devtools_testutils), test method setup, and resource group parameter.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks where untrusted data flows into sensitive operations; primarily uses client SDK methods.",
  "flows": "Test setup creates client -> test method calls client.quota_operation.list() -> results are iterated and asserted.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code is a straightforward test setup.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard unit test class using pytest and Azure SDK for testing quota operations. It sets up a management client and runs a list operation, asserting the response. No malicious code, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. Usage of a test utility and resource preparer is typical for Azure SDK tests. No obfuscated code, malicious behaviors, or security risks identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate test script for Azure SDK functionality with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
