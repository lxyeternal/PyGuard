{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set a version string for a software component, likely as part of a larger generated codebase.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of the VERSION variable; no input reading or data sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs, no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static assignment is inert.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and only assigns a string to a variable. It is boilerplate code typically found at the start of generated source files. No external inputs, no dynamic code execution, no credentials, and no suspicious behaviors are present. The comments indicate it is auto-generated, which is common for SDKs and API clients, and no malicious indicators are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard boilerplate, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
