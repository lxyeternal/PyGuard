  "purpose": "Metadata assignment of the software version string, serving as a version indicator in an auto-generated SDK or API client.",
  "sources": "No input sources; static assignment of VERSION variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or external data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static assignment with no dynamic or external data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, auto-generated, and contains only comments and a static string.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static assignment of a version string with licensing and auto-generation comments. It contains no dynamic behavior, input/output, network activity, or obfuscation. The code is benign, serving solely as metadata. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. There are no signs of malicious activity, hidden code, or security issues. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign boilerplate metadata with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and justified.",
