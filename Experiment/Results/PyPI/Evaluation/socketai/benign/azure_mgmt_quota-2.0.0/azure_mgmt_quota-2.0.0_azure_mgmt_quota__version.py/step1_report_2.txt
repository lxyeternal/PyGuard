  "purpose": "Metadata and licensing information for a generated Python module, indicating version and licensing details.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string assignment for VERSION",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow pathways for untrusted data present",
  "flows": "No data flow pathways identified",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no suspicious or unusual activity; only metadata with licensing comments",
  "analysis": "The code contains only comments, licensing information, and a single assignment of a version string. No input, output, or data processing is present. No potential for data leakage, malicious behavior, or security risks identified. The file appears to be part of auto-generated code with standard licensing notices, which is typical for SDK or API client code. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, consisting solely of metadata and licensing comments with a simple version assignment. No security risks or malicious activity are detected.",
