{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a version string for a software component, likely part of a larger generated codebase.",
  "sources": "The source is a hardcoded string assignment to the variable 'VERSION'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or interact with external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks exists in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, auto-generated, and contains no suspicious or unusual constructs. No obfuscated code, hidden behaviors, or sensitive data handling are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments and a single assignment statement setting a version string. The comments indicate licensing and auto-generation, with no dynamic or external data involved. No malicious patterns, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors, are detectable. The content aligns with standard practices for auto-generated SDK code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving solely to declare a version string. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
