  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code snippet carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content**:  \nThe provided code is a simple, static assignment of a version string (`VERSION = \"2.0.0\"`) with extensive comments about licensing and auto-generation. There are no dynamic behaviors, input/output operations, network calls, or any other code that could be malicious or suspicious.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Indicators**:  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is minimal, auto-generated, and contains only benign metadata. There are no signs of obfuscation, hidden behaviors, or malicious patterns such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n\n3. **Analysis of Scores**:  \n- **Malware Score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code. This is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code's clarity.\n- **Security Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, which is justified since the code does not perform any risky operations.\n\n4. **Assessment of the Logic and Reasoning**:  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly interpret the code as benign boilerplate with no security implications.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns**:  \nNo report assigns an unreasonable score. The confidence levels are all high (1), which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n6. **Overall Evaluation**:  \nGiven the code snippet and the reports, the assessment that this code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risk, is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Your own estimate** for the scores should be:\n  - **Malware**: 0\n  - **Obfuscated**: 0\n  - **Risk**: 0\n\n- **Justification**:  \nThe code is straightforward, static, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements. The reports are consistent and correctly identify the benign nature of this snippet.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThis is a typical auto-generated metadata snippet with no security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
