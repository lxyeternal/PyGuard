  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior:**\n   - All reports describe a minimal, auto-generated code snippet that assigns a version string to a variable `VERSION`.\n   - The code consists solely of comments (licensing, auto-generation notices) and a static assignment.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, network interactions, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - No obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n2. **Malicious Activity & Malware Score:**\n   - All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with malware scores of 0.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions such as data exfiltration, code injection, or executing untrusted code.\n   - Given the simplicity and nature of the code, a malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n3. **Obfuscation & Obfuscated Score:**\n   - The code is straightforward and clearly not obfuscated.\n   - Obfuscated score of 0 across all reports aligns with the content.\n\n4. **Security Risk & Risk Score:**\n   - The code is purely metadata, with no security implications.\n   - The risk scores are consistently 0, which is appropriate.\n\n5. **Scores Justification & Consistency:**\n   - All reports are consistent with each other and with the code content.\n   - The confidence level is 1, reflecting certainty about benign nature.\n   - No adjustments needed based on the analysis.\n\n6. **Potential Concerns & Assumptions:**\n   - The reports assume the code is auto-generated SDK boilerplate, which is reasonable.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are warranted here.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**My own estimate:**  \nGiven the code's simplicity, the lack of dynamic behavior, and the context, I concur with the provided scores. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is benign boilerplate metadata with no security concerns. The current scores are appropriate and justified.",
