  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the findings.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: a simple assignment of a version string, with licensing and auto-generation comments.\n- The code is minimal, static, and contains no dynamic behavior, input/output, or external interactions.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious indicators are evident.\n- The reports consistently conclude that the code is benign, with no security risks.\n\n**Step-by-step review:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code only assigns a string to a variable `VERSION`. No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are present.\n   - Confirmed: No issues are present.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as benign, auto-generated, and metadata-only.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - The reasoning aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware=0`, `securityRisk=0`, `obfuscated=0`, and high confidence (1.0).\n   - These are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for higher risk scores:**\n   - Since the code is static, minimal, and auto-generated, there's no reason to assign a higher risk.\n   - The risk scores are appropriately zero.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, does not contain obfuscated or suspicious code.\n   - Malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions and correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - No unwarranted vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's characteristics.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of the code, my own estimates are:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with all reports and the actual code content. No further action or concern is warranted.",
