{
  "purpose": "The code sets up environment variable sanitization for testing, specifically sanitizing sensitive Azure subscription and credential identifiers in test recordings.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET)",
  "sinks": "Sanitizer functions that modify regex patterns and headers in test recordings",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read, then sanitized in test recordings to prevent leakage of sensitive data",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables with default dummy values; no hardcoded secrets in code. No suspicious or malicious code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code loads environment variables related to Azure credentials, which are then sanitized in test recordings to prevent sensitive data exposure. The use of default dummy values indicates a focus on security during testing. Sanitizers are applied to regex patterns, headers, and JSON body keys. No code injections, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code appears standard for test environment sanitization and does not contain malware or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical test setup for sanitizing sensitive information in recordings. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. The code is legitimate and focused on privacy during testing.",
