{
  "purpose": "The code sets up test environment sanitizers to mask sensitive information such as Azure credentials and cookies during testing recordings.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET), HTTP headers, and JSON response bodies",
  "sinks": "Sanitization functions that mask sensitive data in logs and recordings",
  "flows": "Data from environment variables and HTTP headers/response bodies are passed into sanitizers to mask sensitive information",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables for sensitive credentials; hardcoded default values (all zeros) suggest placeholder or testing data, but no malicious code or backdoors are present",
  "analysis": "The code loads environment variables that contain Azure credentials, which are then sanitized in test recordings to prevent leakage. The use of dotenv and pytest fixtures aligns with standard testing practices. Sanitizers mask credential values, cookies, and access tokens. No suspicious logic or malicious behavior is observed. No code injection, data leakage, or backdoors are present. The code appears to be for legitimate test data sanitization purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed for sanitizing sensitive test data during recordings, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It follows common testing and security best practices.",
