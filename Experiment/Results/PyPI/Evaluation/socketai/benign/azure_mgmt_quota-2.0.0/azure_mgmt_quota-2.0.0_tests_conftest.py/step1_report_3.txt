{
  "purpose": "The code sets up environment variable sanitization and logging sanitization for testing and proxy purposes, primarily to mask sensitive information in test recordings.",
  "sources": "Environment variables such as AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET; headers like Set-Cookie and Cookie; JSON body keys like access_token.",
  "sinks": "Sanitized outputs in logs or recordings; potentially sensitive data could be leaked if not properly sanitized, but sanitization prevents this.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read at the start, then sanitized in logs; headers and JSON body keys are sanitized during data handling to prevent leakage in recordings.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs sanitization of sensitive data and does not contain any malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The use of environment variables and sanitization functions is standard for security purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code loads environment variables that contain sensitive information and applies regex sanitizers to mask these secrets in logs or recordings. It also sanitizes HTTP headers and JSON body keys related to sensitive information. No suspicious or malicious activities are evident; the code's intent is security and privacy preservation during testing. No anomalies, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard sanitization setup for testing environments to prevent sensitive data leaks. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. The use of environment variables and sanitizers aligns with best practices, and no malicious signals are detected.",
