  "purpose": "The code is intended to load environment variables and set up sanitizers for sensitive data in test recordings to prevent sensitive information exposure.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET), which are read using os.environ.get.",
  "sinks": "Sanitizers applied to masking sensitive data in logs, headers, and response bodies within testing frameworks.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are retrieved and then used as regex patterns to identify and mask sensitive data in logs or recordings.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors; the code performs standard sanitization setup for testing purposes. No hardcoded credentials other than placeholders, no obfuscated or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code loads environment variables related to Azure credentials, which are then sanitized in test recordings using regex patterns. The purpose is to prevent sensitive info from appearing in logs. The sanitizers are applied to headers, JSON body keys, and regex patterns for environment variables. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code adheres to standard security practices for test data handling.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard testing setup to sanitize sensitive information in test recordings. It does not contain malware or malicious intent. All observed code is consistent with security best practices for test environments.",
