{
  "purpose": "This code is a test setup script that loads environment variables and applies sanitizers to prevent sensitive information from being recorded in test proxies.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for subscription ID, tenant ID, client ID, and client secret; input data from environment variables",
  "sinks": "Sanitizers applied to regex patterns and headers, but no direct data leaks or untrusted data sinks observed",
  "flows": "Environment variables are used as source inputs, sanitized via regex functions during test proxy setup; no data flows to external systems",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded placeholder values for sensitive credentials raises security concern if not properly replaced; sanitization functions are applied correctly but reliance on environment variables with default values may mask real secrets",
  "analysis": "The code imports environment variables for sensitive credentials and applies sanitizers to mask them in test recordings. It uses standard libraries and functions, with no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code. The presence of default placeholder values is a potential security concern if real secrets are not set, but no malicious behavior or backdoors are evident. The code appears to be standard test setup code with privacy safeguards, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical test fixture script that manages sensitive data masking. No malicious behavior or supply chain security risks are detected. The only concern is the placeholder default values which could be misused if not replaced with actual secrets. Overall, it appears safe.",
