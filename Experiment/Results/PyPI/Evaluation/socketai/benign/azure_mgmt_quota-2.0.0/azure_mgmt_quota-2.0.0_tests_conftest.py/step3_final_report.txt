{
  "purpose": "The code loads environment variables containing sensitive Azure credentials and applies regex and key-based sanitizers to mask these values in logs, recordings, headers, and JSON bodies during testing.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET), headers ('Set-Cookie', 'Cookie'), JSON key '$..access_token'.",
  "sinks": "Sanitized logs, recordings, and outputs where sensitive data could be exposed.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read and their values are masked via regex; headers and JSON keys are sanitized before output or logging.",
  "anomalies": "Use of default placeholder values ('00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000') for secrets, which is typical in test environments but could be problematic if actual secrets are used without replacement.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard test fixture for sanitizing sensitive information during automated testing. It reads environment variables, applies regex sanitizers to mask their values, and sanitizes headers and JSON keys. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is present. The use of placeholder values is acceptable in testing but should be replaced with real secrets in production. The malware score is correctly 0, as there is no malicious activity. The obfuscated score is 0, given the straightforward code. The security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), justified by the test context and placeholder defaults. Overall, the code aligns with best practices for test data sanitization and poses minimal security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, implements standard sanitization procedures, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low risk score is appropriate, and the malware score remains at zero. The placeholder defaults are typical for testing but should be managed carefully in production environments.",
