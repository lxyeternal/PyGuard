  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard setup script; no untrusted data or malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report is accurate. The code only reads local files, extracts version info with regex, and calls `setup()`. No suspicious activity or malicious code.  \n**Scores are appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard setup script with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, accurate. No network, no eval/exec, no untrusted input. The code is straightforward.  \n**Scores are appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous; standard setup script, safe file reads, no dynamic code execution.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nCorrect. No issues identified.  \n**Scores are appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard package setup; no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAccurate. The code is typical for Python packaging.  \n**Scores are appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others; notes that `re.search().group(1)` is used without verifying if the match succeeded, which could raise an exception if the pattern isn't found.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThis is a minor code robustness concern but not a security risk or malicious activity. The regex is used solely for version extraction from local files, which is standard. The lack of match validation could cause runtime errors but doesn't introduce security vulnerabilities or malware.  \n**The securityRisk score of 0.1 is reasonable, reflecting a minor potential for runtime errors, not malicious intent.**\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusions:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** All appropriately low, with report 5 noting a minor potential for runtime errors due to regex match handling.\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — clear, standard code.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — very minor concern about regex match validation, but not a security threat.\n\n**Final note:** The code is a typical setup script with no malicious intent. The only point of improvement is adding a check to ensure `re.search()` found a match before calling `.group(1)`, which would improve robustness but doesn't affect security.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their conclusions. The scores are appropriate, and the overall security posture of this code is very low risk.",
