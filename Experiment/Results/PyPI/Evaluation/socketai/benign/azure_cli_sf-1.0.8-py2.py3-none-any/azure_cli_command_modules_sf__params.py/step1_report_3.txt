  "purpose": "Define command-line parameters for Azure Service Fabric management commands within the Azure CLI extension.",
  "sources": "get_json_object function calls, environment variables (not explicitly used), input parameters for CLI commands",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data processed in a harmful way or sent over network",
  "flows": "User input or JSON data (via get_json_object) flows into argument definitions; no data flows to external systems",
  "anomalies": "Use of get_json_object suggests handling of JSON data, but it is a standard utility function, not suspicious. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily defines command-line argument schemas for various Service Fabric CLI commands, using ParametersContext and c.argument() calls. All data types are either int or get_json_object, with default values assigned. No untrusted data is processed in a way that leads to code execution, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior. No network communication, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The use of get_json_object is a legitimate utility for parsing JSON input. The code is well-structured for parameter definition without executing or evaluating untrusted data.\n\nOverall, the code appears to be a benign configuration script for CLI argument parsing, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward parameter schema definition for Azure Service Fabric CLI commands. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident. It contains no suspicious data flows or anomalies. The code is safe and serves its purpose for CLI argument configuration.",
