{
  "purpose": "Defines CLI parameter configurations for Azure Service Fabric management commands, specifying argument types, defaults, and help descriptions.",
  "sources": "User input via command-line arguments, processed through get_json_object for JSON parameters.",
  "sinks": "Argument parameters fed into CLI commands; no external system interactions or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "User inputs flow into argument definitions; get_json_object parses JSON data but does not execute or transmit it.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI argument setup for Azure Service Fabric commands. It uses standard patterns, with get_json_object handling JSON inputs securely within context. No network activity, code execution, or data leaks are present. The use of get_json_object is typical for CLI tools and does not indicate malicious intent. The code structure is clear, and no anomalies or obfuscation are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are justified given the benign nature of the code and standard JSON handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a configuration script for CLI argument parsing. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. The scores and assessments across reports are consistent and accurate.",
