{
  "purpose": "This code defines CLI command groups and commands for managing Azure Service Fabric clusters and applications, including deprecated commands and support for different API versions.",
  "sources": "Imports modules from azure.cli and related packages, reads deprecation string, configuration variables, and conditionally creates command groups and commands based on API version support.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; no data leaks, system modifications, or untrusted data handling are evident.",
  "flows": "Code initializes modules, sets conditions, then creates command groups and commands, mostly with static parameters and method names. No dynamic or untrusted data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. All commands seem related to Azure Service Fabric management. No obfuscated code or unusual patterns observed. Usage of deprecation string appears benign.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up command groups for managing Azure Service Fabric, with commands for clusters, applications, services, partitions, replicas, nodes, Docker Compose, and chaos testing. The commands are mostly static, with no user input handling or dynamic code execution. The deprecation string indicates deprecated commands. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The structure follows standard Azure CLI extension practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical CLI extension setup for Azure Service Fabric, with no evidence of malware or malicious intent. It mainly registers commands for cluster management. No security risks or anomalies identified.",
