  "purpose": "This code sets up command groups and commands for managing Azure Service Fabric clusters via the Azure CLI, including deprecated commands.",
  "sources": "Imports from azure.cli.command_modules.sf._factory, azure.cli.core.profiles, and azure.cli.core.sdk.util; configuration and command registration functions; hardcoded deprecation string.",
  "sinks": "Execution of command functions such as cf_sf_client and various command handlers, which may process user input but are not shown in detail here.",
  "flows": "Initialization and registration of CLI command groups and commands, with no indication of untrusted data input or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code is primarily configuration for CLI commands. The deprecation string is consistent; no obfuscated code or unusual language features are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and sets up CLI command groups for Service Fabric management, including deprecated commands. No user input handling or untrusted data flows are apparent. The code follows standard patterns for CLI command registration, with clear structure and no signs of malicious logic. The deprecation string is static, and no network or data leakage code is present. Overall, the code appears to be legitimate configuration code for CLI commands, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard CLI command registration script for Azure Service Fabric management, with no malicious behavior, no suspicious anomalies, and no security risks. It is purely configuration for command grouping and deprecation notices.",
