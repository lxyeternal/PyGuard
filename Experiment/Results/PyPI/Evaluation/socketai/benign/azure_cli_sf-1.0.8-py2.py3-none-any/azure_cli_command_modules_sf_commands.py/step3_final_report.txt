  "purpose": "This code sets up CLI command groups and commands for managing Azure Service Fabric, including deprecated commands, without any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration data for CLI command registration, including command names, descriptions, and associated handler functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data inputs or outputs; the code does not process external inputs or write sensitive data.",
  "flows": "The code flows involve defining command groups and registering commands with their respective handler functions, with no data processing or external data flow involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard CLI extension setup for Azure Service Fabric management commands. It includes deprecated command notices but no dynamic or untrusted data handling. No malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The scores for malware and obfuscation are correctly zero. The security risk score is very low (~0.0-0.1), reflecting the benign configuration nature. The confidence in this assessment is high (0.95), given the straightforward structure and lack of suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely configuration for CLI command registration, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The assigned scores are appropriate, and the overall security posture is very low risk.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
