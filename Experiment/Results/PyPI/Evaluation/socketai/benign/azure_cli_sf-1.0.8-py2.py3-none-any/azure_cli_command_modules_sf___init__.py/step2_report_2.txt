  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report concludes there's no malware or security risk, citing straightforward module imports and no dynamic or suspicious behavior.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score of 0 aligns with the analysis; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Potential Issue:** The functions `load_params()` and `load_commands()` import modules dynamically, which could, in theory, be exploited if the imported modules are malicious. However, in this context, the imports are static and from trusted packages, and there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment seems reasonable. No change needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard import patterns with no untrusted data or malicious behavior.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n- **Potential Issue:** The dynamic import functions could be misused if the modules are compromised, but there's no evidence here.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment appears sound; no change needed.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is standard module import for CLI extension, with no malicious activity.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score of 0 is justified.\n- **Potential Issue:** No suspicious code or behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** The evaluation is consistent; no change needed.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, importing modules for CLI command registration.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score of 0 fits the benign nature.\n- **Potential Issue:** No dynamic execution or external input processing.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's conclusion is appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to others, standard module import pattern, no malicious activity.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score of 0 is justified.\n- **Potential Issue:** No suspicious behavior detected.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign, static import nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated Scores:** All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports. No evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, as there are no security risks identified.\n\n**Note:** While dynamic imports can sometimes be risky if modules are compromised, in this context, the code appears to be part of a standard CLI extension setup, importing known modules from a trusted package.\n\n---\n\n**Summary conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code's benign nature. No modifications are necessary. The code is a typical module loader for an Azure CLI extension, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risk.",
