  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, assessing the scores, and ensuring consistency.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is minimal, consisting solely of import statements and two functions that dynamically import modules related to Azure CLI commands for Service Fabric.\n- There is no evidence of dynamic code execution, data handling from untrusted sources, network activity, or obfuscated code.\n- The code appears to be standard setup code for a CLI extension.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Correctly identifies the code as part of CLI module setup.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No untrusted data or data leaks; straightforward imports.\n- **Anomalies:** None observed.\n- **Analysis:** Accurate; no malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard module import code.\n- **Scores:** \n  - malware: 0 (correct)\n  - obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n  - securityRisk: 0 (correct)\n  - risk: 0 (correct)\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- Similar to Report 1, with consistent reasoning.\n- **Scores:** All zero, which aligns with the benign nature.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- Also correctly identifies the code as standard module imports.\n- No suspicious activity or obfuscation.\n- Scores: all zero, appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- Recognizes the code as a module loader for CLI commands.\n- Mentions potential execution of imported modules but clarifies that no malicious activity is observed.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behaviors.\n- Scores: all zero, appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- Same as previous, emphasizing that the code is standard CLI extension setup.\n- No anomalies or malicious indicators.\n- Scores: all zero, appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **Code presence:** The code is straightforward module import statements with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** All reports correctly assign malware, obfuscated, and risk scores of 0.\n- **Justification:** The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. No changes needed.\n\n**Note:** No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risk is present in this code snippet. It is a typical setup script for an Azure CLI extension.\n\n---\n\n**Summary conclusion:**  \nThis code is a benign module import pattern for an Azure CLI extension related to Service Fabric. The reported scores are appropriate, and I concur with the assessments provided.",
