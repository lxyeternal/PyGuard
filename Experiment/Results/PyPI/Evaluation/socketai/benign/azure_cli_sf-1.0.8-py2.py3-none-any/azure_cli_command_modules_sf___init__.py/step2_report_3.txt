  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple module imports for an Azure CLI extension related to Service Fabric.\n- No reports mention dynamic code execution, untrusted input handling, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n- The code is minimal, straightforward, and adheres to standard practices for CLI extension setup.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads are evident.\n\n**Confirming the code's behavior:**\n- The code only imports modules and defines functions that load additional modules.\n- There are no suspicious operations, such as executing untrusted code, network connections, or file modifications.\n- The functions `load_params()` and `load_commands()` dynamically import modules, which is typical for plugin architectures.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n- The reports do not identify any logical errors or security flaws.\n- The code appears correctly structured for its purpose.\n\n**Scores and justification:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is consistent with the analysis.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 1 or 0.9), appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Potential issues or assumptions:**\n- The only potential concern could be if these import statements are part of a malicious payload. However, given the context and the reports' analysis, this seems unlikely.\n- No evidence suggests that the imported modules themselves are malicious or that the import process is exploited.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is benign, standard for CLI module setup.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate; the code is benign and poses no security threat. The scores reflect this appropriately.",
