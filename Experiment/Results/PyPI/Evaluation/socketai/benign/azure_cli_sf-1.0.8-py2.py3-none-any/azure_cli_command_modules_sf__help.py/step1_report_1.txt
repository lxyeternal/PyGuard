  "purpose": "Define help documentation for the Azure CLI Service Fabric commands",
  "sources": "Imports from azure.cli.core.help_files and the assignment of help texts to the helps dictionary entries",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processing or external outputs present",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only assigns static help strings",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed; standard documentation setup",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module, then assigns predefined static help text strings to entries in a help documentation dictionary. The help texts are static and intended for CLI help purposes. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The code is straightforward and consistent with standard documentation practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical static help documentation setup for CLI commands with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
