  "purpose": "Define help documentation for Azure CLI Service Fabric commands and groups.",
  "sources": "Import from azure.cli.core.help_files and assignment of help text to 'helps' dictionary keys.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data input or output mechanisms are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only sets static help text.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward static assignments with no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a help configuration module from Azure CLI core, then assigns static help descriptions to various command groups in the 'helps' dictionary. There are no external inputs, user data, or dynamic evaluations. The help texts are static strings describing command functionalities. There is no evidence of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or data leaks. The code appears to be a typical configuration setup for CLI help documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely defines static help documentation for Azure Service Fabric CLI commands. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies are present. The purpose is purely informational/help setup, with no indicators of supply chain attack vectors.",
