  "purpose": "Define static help documentation strings for CLI command groups related to Azure Service Fabric.",
  "sources": "Static string assignments in the 'helps' dictionary after importing 'azure.cli.core.help_files'. No external or untrusted data sources involved.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources; the code only assigns static strings to a dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscation detected. The code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module and assigns predefined static help strings to a dictionary for CLI help documentation. No dynamic data, user input, network activity, or code execution occurs. All reports correctly identify this as benign static documentation setup. Scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero, with high confidence. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration for CLI help text. It poses no security risks or malicious intent. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
