  "purpose": "Implements client certificate authentication for secure connections, allowing optional SSL verification disabling.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: cert, ca_cert, no_verify; session creation via super().signed_session()",
  "sinks": "Disabling SSL verification with 'session.verify = False' when 'no_verify' is True",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> signed_session() -> session.cert/session.verify -> SSL connection setup",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'no_verify' to disable SSL verification, which can expose to man-in-the-middle attacks",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of client certificate authentication. It accepts optional parameters for certificates and SSL verification control. The main security concern is the 'no_verify' flag, which disables SSL verification when True, posing a security risk but not malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The malware score is 0, as no malicious activity is detected. The obfuscated score is 0, given the clarity of the code. The security risk score is approximately 0.2-0.3, reflecting the potential insecurity of disabling SSL verification. The scores are consistent with the analysis and reflect a known security concern rather than malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of client certificate authentication with an optional insecure SSL verification toggle. It does not contain malicious or obfuscated code. The primary security issue is the optional disabling of SSL verification, which should be used cautiously. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is around 0.2-0.3, aligning with the analysis. No evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation is present.",
