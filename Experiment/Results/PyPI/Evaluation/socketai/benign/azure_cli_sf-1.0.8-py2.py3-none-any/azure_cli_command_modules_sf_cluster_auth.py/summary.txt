  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of client certificate authentication with an optional insecure SSL verification toggle. It does not contain malicious or obfuscated code. The primary security issue is the optional disabling of SSL verification, which should be used cautiously. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is around 0.2-0.3, aligning with the analysis. No evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation is present."
