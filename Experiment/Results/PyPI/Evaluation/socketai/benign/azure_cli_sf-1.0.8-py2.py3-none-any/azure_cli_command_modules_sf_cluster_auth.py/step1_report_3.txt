  "purpose": "Provides client certificate authentication for Service Fabric clusters by creating signed requests sessions.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: cert, ca_cert, no_verify",
  "sinks": "session.cert, session.verify",
  "flows": "cert/ca_cert/no_verify → session.cert/session.verify",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'session.verify = False' disables SSL verification, which can be insecure; no other anomalies present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for client certificate authentication, allowing optional specification of client certificates and CA certificates. It disables SSL verification if 'no_verify' is True, which is a known security risk but not malicious. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code appears standard for such authentication purposes, with attention needed if 'no_verify' is enabled in production environments.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements standard client certificate authentication with an optional insecure setting to disable SSL verification. No malicious intent or malware is detected. The main concern is the potential security risk posed by 'no_verify' being True, but this alone does not constitute malicious behavior.",
