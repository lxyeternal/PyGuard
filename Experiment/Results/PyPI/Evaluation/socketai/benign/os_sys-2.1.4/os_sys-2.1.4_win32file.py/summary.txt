  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there is no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The main concern is the misspelled package name and the use of wildcard import, which could be exploited in a broader malicious context. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (around 0.2), reflecting the potential for misuse but no active threat detected."
