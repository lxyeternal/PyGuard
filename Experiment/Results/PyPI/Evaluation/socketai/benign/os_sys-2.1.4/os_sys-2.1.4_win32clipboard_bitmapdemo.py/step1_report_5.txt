  "purpose": "This script creates a Windows GUI application that monitors clipboard changes and displays bitmap images from the clipboard in a window.",
  "sources": "Reads clipboard data via win32clipboard.GetClipboardData, specifically CF_BITMAP format. Listens for clipboard change messages via Windows message loop.",
  "sinks": "Uses win32gui functions to draw images on the window. No untrusted data is sent over network or written to files. No external data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Clipboard data (source) is fetched and rendered in the window (sink). No external network or system modification flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no backdoors, no suspicious network activity. The code is straightforward, uses standard Windows API calls. No obfuscation or unusual code patterns. The code’s purpose is to display clipboard bitmaps; it does not perform any hidden or malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a GUI application that integrates with the Windows clipboard viewer chain. It listens for clipboard changes, attempts to retrieve bitmap data, and displays it within a window. If no bitmap is available, it displays a message. All API calls are standard for GUI display and clipboard monitoring, with no suspicious data handling or external communication. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign Windows clipboard viewer application that displays bitmap images from the clipboard. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or contain malware indicators. It appears to serve a legitimate purpose without security risks.",
