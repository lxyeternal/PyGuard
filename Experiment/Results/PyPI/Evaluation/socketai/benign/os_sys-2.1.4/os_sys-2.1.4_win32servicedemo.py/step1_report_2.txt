  "purpose": "The code enumerates Windows services and prints their names, descriptions, and statuses.",
  "sources": "Reads Windows service information via win32service and win32con modules, specifically through OpenSCManager and EnumServicesStatus functions.",
  "sinks": "Outputs service details to standard output using print(). No direct sink that leaks untrusted data or performs malicious actions detected.",
  "flows": "Source: EnumServices() calls OpenSCManager, then EnumServicesStatus; Output (sink) is print of service info.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns observed. Uses standard Windows API calls for service enumeration without obfuscation or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script interacts with Windows service control management API to list services. It uses standard API functions with proper access rights and straightforward logic. No data leaks, no network activity, and no malicious commands or behaviors detected. The code appears to be for legitimate administrative or diagnostic purposes. It does not modify, delete, or otherwise manipulate services beyond enumeration.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard Windows service enumeration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign script intended for system inspection.",
