  "sources": "win32service.OpenSCManager, win32service.EnumServicesStatus",
  "sinks": "print() statements outputting service info; no untrusted data handling or external communication",
  "flows": "Data read from system via EnumServicesStatus, output directly through print()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of official API for enumeration",
  "analysis": "The code opens the Service Control Manager with read permissions, enumerates all services of type SERVICE_WIN32, and prints their short name, description, and status. It uses standard, well-documented APIs without obfuscation or malicious code. No data leaks, network activity, or system modifications are present. The code is purely informational and intended for system auditing. The lack of suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior indicates a benign script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign Windows service enumeration utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs read-only operations and outputs system information without any suspicious or malicious activity.",
