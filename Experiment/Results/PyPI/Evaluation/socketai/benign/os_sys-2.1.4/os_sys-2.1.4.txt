The current evidence does not suggest malicious activity, and the malware score should remain at 0. The obfuscated score is slightly elevated at 0.1 due to the misspelling, but this alone is insufficient to classify the code as obfuscated. The security risk score remains low at 0.2, reflecting minimal immediate threat based solely on this import."

The injection of simulated keyboard events is for automation or testing, not malicious activity. Scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, reflecting minimal risk associated with console manipulation and input simulation."

The main concern is the misspelled package name and the use of wildcard import, which could be exploited in a broader malicious context. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (around 0.2), reflecting the potential for misuse but no active threat detected."

The external DLL load is standard and not suspicious in this context. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to DLL loading, which is common in Windows applications. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. The risk score of approximately 0.1-0.2 is appropriate, reflecting the low threat level."

No active malware is detected, but the potential for misuse exists if the imported functions are used maliciously in the broader codebase. Further verification of the package source and review of subsequent code is recommended."
