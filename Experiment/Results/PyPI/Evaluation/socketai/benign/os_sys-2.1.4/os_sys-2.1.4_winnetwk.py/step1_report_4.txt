{
  "purpose": "This code defines various constants related to network resource types, resource states, connection flags, and other network-related parameters, likely for use in network management or enumeration functions.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions are static and hardcoded; no external data sources or input handling present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data transmission points identified; code does not process untrusted input or output data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or source-to-sink paths; this is purely a set of constant definitions without runtime logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code is auto-generated from header files; contains numerous network-related constants but no suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or dynamic code are present. It appears as static definitions typical of header files.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is a collection of constant definitions related to network resource types, connection flags, display types, and other network management parameters. It is generated by a tool from Windows header files. There are no functions, data processing, input handling, or external communication. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present. All constants serve as static configuration or reference values for network operations. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of constant definitions for network resource management, with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears as auto-generated header data without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
