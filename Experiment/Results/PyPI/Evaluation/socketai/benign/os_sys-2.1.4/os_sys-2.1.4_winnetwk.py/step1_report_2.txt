{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of constants and enumerations related to network resource types, connection flags, and other network configuration parameters, likely for use in network management or enumeration functions.",
  "sources": "No dynamic input sources or external data reads are present; the code is static constant definitions.",
  "sinks": "There are no sink points where untrusted data is processed or can lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "The code does not contain any data flow or processing logic, only constant definitions.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be automatically generated from a header file, containing only static constant definitions with no executable or suspicious patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely a collection of constant definitions representing network resource types, flags, and identifiers. It serves as a reference for network resource management. No input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated features, and no malicious behavior are detected. The definitions are standard, and there is no indication of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign static set of network resource constants extracted from a header file. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is likely used for network enumeration or resource management purposes.",
