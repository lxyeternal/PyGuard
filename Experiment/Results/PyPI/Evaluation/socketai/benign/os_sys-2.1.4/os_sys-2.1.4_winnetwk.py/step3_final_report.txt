{
  "purpose": "The code defines a set of constants representing network resource types, flags, display types, and related enumerations from the Windows SDK header 'winnetwk.h'. It serves as static reference data for network management functions.",
  "sources": "Static constant definitions extracted from the header file; no data input or external data sources involved.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process, transmit, or handle untrusted data or execute any operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows, input/output, or dynamic execution paths; the code is purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected. The code is straightforward, auto-generated, and static.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of constant definitions for network resource identifiers, resource types, connection flags, display types, and related enumerations. It contains no functions, dynamic code, or data processing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, as it cannot execute or perform any harmful actions. The security risk score is 0, given its static, non-executable nature. The confidence in this assessment is high (close to 1), as the code is clearly a static header file extract with no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of static constants from Windows SDK headers, posing no security threat or malware risk. All reports correctly identify its static, non-malicious nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
