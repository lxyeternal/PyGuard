{
  "purpose": "The code defines constants and macros related to Windows network resources, connections, and network interface properties, likely generated from a header file for use in network programming.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions directly written into the code, no external data input, environment variables, or dynamic data sources present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs involving untrusted data, system modifications, or network transmissions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths exist within this static constant definitions code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. The code is purely declarative with standard constant definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of constant definitions derived from a Windows header file, used for network resource management. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The absence of runtime logic, user input, or network communication supports a benign intent. It appears to be a standard, auto-generated header file used for network API calls.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the static nature, straightforward purpose, and absence of dynamic or suspicious elements, the code is not malicious. It serves as a utility header for network programming without any malicious intent or security risks.",
