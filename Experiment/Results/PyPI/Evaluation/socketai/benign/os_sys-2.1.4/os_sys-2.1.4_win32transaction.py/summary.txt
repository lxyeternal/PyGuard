  "conclusion": "The import statement alone does not demonstrate malicious intent but warrants caution due to the misspelling and use of wildcard import. No active malware is detected, but the potential for misuse exists if the imported functions are used maliciously in the broader codebase. Further verification of the package source and review of subsequent code is recommended."
