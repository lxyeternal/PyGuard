  "conclusion": "This is a benign import statement with a suspicious package name spelling that warrants further investigation if additional code is available. The current evidence does not suggest malicious activity, and the malware score should remain at 0. The obfuscated score is slightly elevated at 0.1 due to the misspelling, but this alone is insufficient to classify the code as obfuscated. The security risk score remains low at 0.2, reflecting minimal immediate threat based solely on this import."
