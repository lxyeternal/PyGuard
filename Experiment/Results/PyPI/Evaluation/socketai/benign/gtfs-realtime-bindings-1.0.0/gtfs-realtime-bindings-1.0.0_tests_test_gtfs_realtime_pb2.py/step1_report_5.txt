  "purpose": "Unit test for parsing GTFS real-time vehicle position data using protobuf",
  "sources": "Reading data from 'vehicle_position.pb' file located in the same directory as the script",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing beyond reading a file",
  "flows": "File read -> Parse data -> Validate parsed content",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward unit test that loads a protobuf file, parses it, and performs assertions to verify content. The file path is constructed dynamically based on the script's directory. The protobuf library is used solely for parsing known GTFS data. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code appears present. There is no indication of obfuscation, malicious backdoors, or malicious intent. The code operates solely on local files and performs simple validation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign unit test for GTFS data parsing with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate testing script.",
