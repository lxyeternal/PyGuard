  "purpose": "A unit test that reads and parses a local protobuf file ('vehicle_position.pb') to verify its contents.",
  "sources": "Reads 'vehicle_position.pb' file from the same directory as the script.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; only local file reading and protobuf parsing.",
  "flows": "Reads file -> Parses protobuf message -> Performs assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward code with no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, standard unit test that loads a protobuf file, parses it, and performs assertions on the data. It does not involve network activity, dynamic code execution, or external data sources. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code structures are present. The operations are confined to local file access and protobuf parsing, which are typical for testing scripts. The code's purpose is benign, and no security vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward unit test for protobuf parsing with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores should be malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, and confidence: 1.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
