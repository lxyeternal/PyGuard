  "purpose": "Unit testing for parsing GTFS real-time vehicle position data from a protobuf file.",
  "sources": "Reads a local protobuf file 'vehicle_position.pb' in the same directory as the script.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data outputs or external communication.",
  "flows": "Reads the protobuf file (source) and parses it into a protobuf message object (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Uses a static filename 'vehicle_position.pb'; no dynamic input or user-controlled data. No suspicious code behavior or hardcoded credentials.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unit test that loads a local protobuf file and parses it using Google's protobuf library. No external network calls, no data exfiltration, no dynamic code execution, and no sensitive information handling. The code appears standard for a testing scenario with no malicious intent. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit test for GTFS real-time data parsing with no malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
