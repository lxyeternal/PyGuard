  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the 'gtfs-realtime-bindings' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading import statements, especially the 'setuptools' import, and configuration parameters in 'setup()'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'setup()' which installs dependencies and sets up package metadata; no direct untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Import statements lead to setup configuration; no external data flows or untrusted data manipulation observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns; the code is straightforward setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs package setup using setuptools, with no input/output handling, network communication, or malicious constructs. It handles missing 'setuptools' gracefully by error message, but this is standard practice. No obfuscated code, no hidden backdoors, or malicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate package configuration script.",
