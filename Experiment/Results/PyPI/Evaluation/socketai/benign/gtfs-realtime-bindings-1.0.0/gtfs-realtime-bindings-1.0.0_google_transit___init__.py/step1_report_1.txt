  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be related to importing modules, handling environment variables, or performing some form of data processing, but the code snippet is missing, so the exact purpose cannot be determined.",
  "sources": "Input sources could include environment variables, user inputs, or file reads if present, but none are explicitly shown in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, system commands, or data output functions if present, but no specific sinks are visible in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Without the actual code, source-to-sink data flows cannot be definitively identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious function calls, or obfuscated code, are identifiable due to the absence of code.",
  "analysis": "The review cannot proceed meaningfully without the actual code content. The provided input lacks code, making it impossible to analyze code behavior, detect anomalies, or identify potential malicious actions. All assessment fields are unanswerable in this context.",
  "conclusion": "Insufficient information to determine the purpose, security risks, or malicious behavior. The code snippet is missing, so no conclusive analysis can be performed.",
