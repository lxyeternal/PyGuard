  "conclusion": "The analysis confirms that only Report 4 presents moderate suspicion due to dynamic code execution, warranting a slightly higher malware and obfuscation score. The other reports are benign. Overall, the scores are justified and consistent with the evidence, with a recommended malware score of 0.2, obfuscation score of 0.6, and security risk of 0.3."
