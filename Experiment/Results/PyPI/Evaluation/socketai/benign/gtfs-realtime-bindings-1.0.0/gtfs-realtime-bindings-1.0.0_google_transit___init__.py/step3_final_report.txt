  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code segments involving environment variables, network/file I/O, dynamic execution functions (eval, exec).",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, code injection points via eval/exec, network connections, log outputs.",
  "flows": "Input sources (environment variables, external data) potentially passing through eval/exec or network calls.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec functions indicating obfuscation or malicious intent; absence of code in some reports.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits no malicious activity in most reports, with the exception of Report 4 which uses eval/exec, raising suspicion of obfuscation and potential malicious payloads. The scores assigned in the reports are generally consistent with the observations. The malware score for Report 4 (0.3) is justified but could be slightly increased due to dynamic execution functions. Obfuscation score (0.7) aligns with the suspicion of code obfuscation. The overall security risk is moderate (around 0.4) in Report 4, reflecting potential danger without confirmed malicious activity. Other reports show minimal risk and no malware indicators, with scores appropriately set to zero or low values.",
  "conclusion": "The analysis confirms that only Report 4 presents moderate suspicion due to dynamic code execution, warranting a slightly higher malware and obfuscation score. The other reports are benign. Overall, the scores are justified and consistent with the evidence, with a recommended malware score of 0.2, obfuscation score of 0.6, and security risk of 0.3.",
