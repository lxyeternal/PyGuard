  "purpose": "Declare the current package as a namespace package using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "The import statement importing 'pkg_resources' and calling 'declare_namespace(__name__)'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; the code simply declares a namespace, which does not directly handle untrusted data or perform actions based on external input.",
  "flows": "No data flow is present; the code performs a static declaration without processing data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual behaviors; the code is minimal and standard for namespace packages.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and calls 'declare_namespace' with '__name__', which is a standard pattern for setting up namespace packages in Python. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activity. It is a straightforward namespace declaration with no complex logic or external data handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup for a namespace package and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks.",
