{
  "purpose": "Declare the current package as a namespace package using pkg_resources",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'pkg_resources' module",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flows to external systems or files",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; the code is a single statement for namespace declaration, which is standard practice",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and calls 'declare_namespace' with the current module's name, marking it as a namespace package. This is a common technique for distributing large, multi-part packages. No malicious behavior, suspicious code, or obfuscation is evident. The code does not perform any data processing, I/O, or network communication. It appears to be a legitimate, minimal namespace declaration statement.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace declaration with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It simply sets up the package namespace.",
