{
  "purpose": "Declare the current package as a namespace package using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it dynamically imports 'pkg_resources' via __import__.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data, perform network communication, or write files.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only executes a namespace declaration without external data interaction.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward, standard namespace declaration pattern with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports 'pkg_resources' and calls 'declare_namespace' with __name__, a common pattern for namespace packages. It involves no data processing, network activity, or external inputs. All reports correctly identify it as a benign, standard namespace declaration. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace declaration with no malicious or security concerns. All reports are accurate, and the risk scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
