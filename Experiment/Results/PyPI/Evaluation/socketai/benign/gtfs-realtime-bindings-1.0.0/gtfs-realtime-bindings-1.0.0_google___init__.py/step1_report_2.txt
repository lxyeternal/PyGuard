  "purpose": "Declare a namespace package using pkg_resources",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'pkg_resources' module and calls declare_namespace with __name__",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "Import of 'pkg_resources' -> declaration of namespace with __name__",
  "anomalies": "Use of __import__ and declare_namespace is common for namespace packages; no suspicious code behavior or data leaks",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports 'pkg_resources' and declares a namespace package with the current module's name. This is a standard pattern used in Python packaging for namespace packages, especially with pkg_resources. There are no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior. No external inputs, no network activity, no credential handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard namespace declaration for Python packages; there is no malicious intent or security risk evident from this snippet.",
