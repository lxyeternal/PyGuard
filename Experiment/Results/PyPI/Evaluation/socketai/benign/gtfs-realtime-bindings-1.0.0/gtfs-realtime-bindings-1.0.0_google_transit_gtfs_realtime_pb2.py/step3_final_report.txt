{
  "purpose": "This code defines protobuf message schemas for GTFS-realtime transit data, generated automatically by the protobuf compiler from the gtfs-realtime.proto schema.",
  "sources": "The code reads embedded serialized protobuf descriptor data, which is standard in generated protobuf files.",
  "sinks": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code contains only static schema definitions.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows; the code only sets up message descriptors without processing external input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely auto-generated protobuf schema code with no executable logic, network operations, or dynamic data handling. The embedded serialized descriptors are typical for protobuf generated files. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with the code's nature and content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign protobuf schema definition for GTFS-realtime transit data, with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores are appropriate and justified.",
