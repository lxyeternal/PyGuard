  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a benign utility module copied from Scrapy, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The functions handle internal data and reflection safely.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. This seems appropriate given the analysis.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it recognizes the code as straightforward utility functions for argument handling and introspection, with no malicious intent or external data handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Justified.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, confirms benign utility functions with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports, no malicious or suspicious behavior identified.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Justified.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar conclusion—safe, utility functions with no external or malicious behavior. Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.1) due to conservative approach, but still within reason.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1. This is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. I agree with a malware score of 0 across the board.\n- **Obfuscated score:** The code is straightforward, copied from Scrapy, with no obfuscation or malicious concealment. Obfuscated=0 is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.1, reflecting minimal or no security risk. Given the code's benign nature, I would assign a risk score of **0** for all.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- The code uses reflection (`inspect.signature`) and handles partial functions safely.\n- No external data, network, or file operations are present.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n- The code is intended as internal utility, with no security implications.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent and accurate. I agree with the given scores, and I would maintain or slightly tighten the risk score to 0 for all reports.",
