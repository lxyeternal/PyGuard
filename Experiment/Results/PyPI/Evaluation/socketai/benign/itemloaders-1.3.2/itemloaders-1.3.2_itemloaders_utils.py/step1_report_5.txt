{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling callables and iterables, primarily sourced from the Scrapy project for testing and refactoring purposes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions such as 'func' in get_func_args and 'arg' in arg_to_iter.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "The code processes input data and callable signatures without passing untrusted data to external systems or performing insecure operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. The code contains comments indicating it's a temporary placeholder or copied from another source.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions to convert various argument types into iterables and extract parameter names from callables, including handling of partial functions. It uses standard library modules like 'inspect' and 'functools' without executing or evaluating untrusted data. No hardcoded credentials, network operations, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The functions are well-structured, with appropriate error handling, and do not include obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as utility functions for internal use, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a straightforward implementation with no external communication, data leaks, or malicious intent.",
