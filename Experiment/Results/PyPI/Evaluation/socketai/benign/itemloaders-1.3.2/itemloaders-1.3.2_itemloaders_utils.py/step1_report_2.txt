  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling callables and arguments, copied from Scrapy for testing and refactoring.",
  "sources": "Function arguments, the inspect.signature call, and the 'func' parameter passed to get_func_args.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks, no data leaks or untrusted data handling points present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from function parameters to internal logic; no external untrusted data sources or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated segments. Code appears straightforward and purpose-specific.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions: arg_to_iter converts various types to iterables, and get_func_args retrieves argument names from callables, accounting for partial functions and self parameter removal. No external data sources or sinks are involved. The code imports inspect and functools, uses standard Python features, and performs typical argument parsing without unusual constructs or dynamic code execution. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module copied from Scrapy, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs safe argument parsing and introspection, with no data leaks or harmful operations.",
