{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for argument conversion and introspection, copied from Scrapy, used internally for function parameter analysis.",
  "sources": "Function arguments, inspect.signature, and functools.partial attributes",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data processing observed",
  "flows": "Input arguments are processed through type checks and reflection; no external or untrusted data flows into external systems",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of reflection and argument handling without obfuscation or malicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code provides safe utility functions: 'arg_to_iter' converts various input types into iterables without security concerns; 'get_func_args' safely inspects function signatures, handling partial functions and stripping 'self' as needed. No external data sources, network operations, or untrusted data handling are present. The code uses standard Python introspection techniques and does not include obfuscation or malicious constructs. All operations are internal and controlled, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for argument processing and introspection, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are appropriate; a minimal security risk score of 0.1 could be considered due to reflection, but given the benign context, 0 is justified.",
