  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling function arguments and iterables, copied from scrapy source for testing and refactoring purposes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for functions, specifically the 'func' parameter in get_func_args.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data are present; functions operate on provided parameters and internal variables.",
  "flows": "Input data (such as 'func' and 'arg') flow through type checks and reflection (inspect.signature) to process function signatures and argument lists.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions: 'arg_to_iter' converts various argument types into an iterable, with no data leaks or malicious behavior; 'get_func_args' retrieves argument names from callables, with checks for callability and handling partial functions. Use of 'inspect.signature' is standard for reflection, and no untrusted data handling or network operations are present. The code is straightforward, intended for internal use, and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module, copied from scrapy, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs safe introspection and data handling without any suspicious or malicious behaviors.",
