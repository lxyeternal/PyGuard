  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** Utility functions copied from Scrapy, safe, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully benign, no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, utility functions with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Also benign.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, straightforward utility code, no external data or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Similar benign utility functions, no malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Safe.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same utility functions, no external threats, very cautious with scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Note:** Slightly non-zero securityRisk, possibly due to the nature of reflection and introspection, which can sometimes be misused, but here it appears benign.\n- **Assessment:** Still benign, with a very low security risk score.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Code presence:** All reports confirm the code is straightforward utility functions copied from Scrapy.\n- **Malware risk:** All reports assign zero, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscation:** Zero, no obfuscated code detected.\n- **Security risk:** Zero or near-zero, justified given the code's nature.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code does not process untrusted data, does not perform network operations, or execute dynamic code.\n- The use of `inspect.signature` and handling of partial functions are standard introspection techniques.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present.\n- The functions are purely utility, with no external side effects.\n\n### Recommended Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 (consistent across reports, no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** 0.0 to 0.1 (very low, justified by the use of reflection but no actual risk observed)\n\n---\n\n### Final conclusion:\n**The code is a benign utility module, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.** The existing scores are appropriate. If anything, a very slight increase in the security risk score to 0.1 could be justified due to the reflective nature of the code, but given the benign context, maintaining it at 0 is reasonable.\n\n**My estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments and the actual code analysis.",
