{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling callables and iterables, originally copied from Scrapy source for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "No direct input sources; functions operate on provided arguments such as callables or generic data.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs that process untrusted data; mainly internal logic.",
  "flows": "Function arguments flow into processing functions, no external data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. No obfuscation, code injection, or suspicious network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines helper functions for iterable conversion and extracting argument names from callables, including handling partial functions. It performs signature inspection using the 'inspect' module, with standard exception handling. The code is straightforward, uses no external untrusted input or system calls, and contains no suspicious patterns, malicious payloads, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module copied from Scrapy for testing purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It performs internal data handling and introspection without external influence.",
