  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code and the context.\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n- The code is a straightforward unit test suite for the `SelectJmes` processor.\n- It uses static, predefined test cases.\n- No dynamic code execution, external network calls, or data leaks are evident.\n- The imported `SelectJmes` is external, but its usage appears standard and safe within this context.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of individual reports:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correctly identifies the code as a unit test with static data, no anomalies.\n- **Malware & security risk:** Both are zero.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Similar to Report 1, confirms no external data or suspicious activity.\n- **Malware & security risk:** Zero.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Again, confirms straightforward testing with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware & security risk:** Zero.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same conclusion, no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Malware & security risk:** Zero.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Similar assessment, with a slight note on a minimal security risk score (0.1). Given the code's nature, this is likely an overestimation.\n- **Malware:** Zero.\n- **Security risk:** The assigned 0.1 seems to be a conservative or default value, but in this context, it's unwarranted.\n- **Verdict:** The score should be adjusted to 0, as there's no real security concern.\n\n---\n\n### **Scores and Justifications:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** Given the code's simplicity and safety, the risk score should be **0** across all reports. The only exception is report 5, which currently has 0.1; this should be lowered to 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential issues or assumptions:**\n- No issues are present in the code itself.\n- The reports do not assume any malicious behavior; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n- The only minor discrepancy is the risk score in report 5, which is slightly overestimated.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n- **Adjust the risk score in report 5 from 0.1 to 0.**  \n- **Maintain malware and obfuscated scores at 0.**  \n- **Overall, the code is safe, and the reports are accurate.**\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | **0** |\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, benign unit test with no security concerns.",
