  "purpose": "Unit testing for the ItemLoader class to verify item addition and loading functionalities.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class and method definitions, dynamic import checks.",
  "sinks": "None of the code contains data flows leading to potential data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Input data is added to the ItemLoader and then loaded; no external untrusted data flows to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; usage of standard testing libraries and conditional imports with no malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of unit tests for the ItemLoader class, primarily testing the addition of various item types and verifying the output. It includes conditional imports with exception handling to skip tests if dependencies are missing. There is no evidence of hardcoded credentials, data exfiltration, or any malicious behavior. The imports and code structure are typical for testing environments. No obfuscation or malware patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward testing script with no malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily performs benign unit testing of a data loading component without any suspicious activities or vulnerabilities.",
