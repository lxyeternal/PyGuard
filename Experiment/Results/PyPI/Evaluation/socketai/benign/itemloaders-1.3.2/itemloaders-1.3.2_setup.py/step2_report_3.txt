  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python library.\n- No untrusted data handling, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, no obfuscation, and no suspicious patterns are identified.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the straightforward, standard code.\n- The confidence scores are all 1.0, indicating high certainty that the code is benign.\n- The security risk scores are 0, consistent with the above.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code reads a static README file, sets package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers.\n- No signs of hardcoded secrets, code injection, or malicious logic.\n- The dependencies are common and version-locked appropriately.\n- No dynamic or untrusted input processing.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The reports are thorough and consistent; no anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The scores assigned seem reasonable given the analysis.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Since the code is a typical setup.py script with no malicious indicators, I agree with the assigned scores.\n- No changes are necessary to the scores based on the provided information.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Justification:**\n- The code is a standard packaging script with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The dependency constraints are reasonable.\n- No untrusted data, no obfuscation, no code injection, no network activity.\n- The high confidence scores are justified.\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports correctly identify this as a benign, standard setup script with no security concerns. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
