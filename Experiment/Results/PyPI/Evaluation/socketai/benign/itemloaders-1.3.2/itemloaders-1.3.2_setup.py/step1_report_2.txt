  "purpose": "Setuptools-based setup script for packaging the 'itemloaders' Python library",
  "sources": "Reading the README file for long_description; defining package metadata and dependencies",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks, no untrusted data handling or output operations",
  "flows": "No significant data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; setup process is straightforward",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or obfuscated code detected",
  "analysis": "The script reads a README file to set the long description, then calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and configuration. All code appears standard for Python package setup. No inputs from untrusted sources or network operations are present. Dependencies are specified with version constraints, and there are no code injection or malicious behavior indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
