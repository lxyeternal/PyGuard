  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the Python library 'itemloaders' with metadata, dependencies, and configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads static README.rst file for long description; static configuration data for package setup.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network activity or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "Static data from file and configuration passed directly to setuptools; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Minor potential typo in 'package_data' referencing 'itemadapter' instead of 'itemloaders', but not security-related.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, static setup.py script with no dynamic code, user input, network activity, or obfuscation. Dependencies are common and version-locked. No suspicious patterns, secrets, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code reads only a static README file and passes static configuration data. All reports correctly assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence, consistent with the benign nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py is a benign, standard packaging script with no security issues or malicious intent. All evidence supports a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The code is safe and appropriate for production use.",
