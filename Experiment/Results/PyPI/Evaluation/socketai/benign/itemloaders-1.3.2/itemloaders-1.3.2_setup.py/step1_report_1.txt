  "purpose": "Setup configuration script for a Python package named 'itemloaders' intended for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.rst' file for long description; uses 'find_packages' to identify packages; defines dependencies in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is used to influence system behavior or leak information.",
  "flows": "Reads the README file -> Sets up package metadata and dependencies. No data flows from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic. The code follows standard setup.py patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup activities: reading documentation, configuring package data, defining dependencies, and setting metadata. It does not include any dynamic code execution, user input handling, or network activity. The dependencies are well-defined and common for Python packages. No suspicious or malicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate.",
