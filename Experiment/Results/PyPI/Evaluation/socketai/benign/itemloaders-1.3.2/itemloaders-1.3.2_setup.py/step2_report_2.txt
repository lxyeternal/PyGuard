  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the same or very similar setup.py code, which is a standard Python packaging script.\n- No dynamic code execution, user input handling, network activity, or obfuscated code is present.\n- The dependencies are common, well-defined, and version-locked.\n- The code reads a static README file and passes static configuration data to setuptools.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are detected.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n- The code appears to be a straightforward setup script with no signs of malicious or suspicious activity.\n- No untrusted data sources, no code injection, no network activity, no obfuscation.\n- The logic is standard, and the flow is static and predictable.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- **No significant flaws** are evident. However, one minor point is that `package_data` references `\"itemadapter\"` but the package name is `\"itemloaders\"`. This could be a typo or misconfiguration, but it doesn't pose a security risk. It might affect packaging correctness but not security.\n\n### Scores and Reasoning:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports, which is consistent with the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** 0 for all reports, as there's no security risk or vulnerability.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n- All reports correctly identify the script as benign.\n- The absence of dynamic code, untrusted input, or malicious patterns justifies zero scores across malware, obfuscated, and risk.\n\n### Any Inconsistencies or Unreasonable Scores?\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard, static setup script for packaging a Python library. No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior is detected. The dependencies are typical, and the logic is straightforward. The only minor note is the potential typo in `package_data`, but that doesn't impact security.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate; the code is safe, with no security issues. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero across all categories.",
