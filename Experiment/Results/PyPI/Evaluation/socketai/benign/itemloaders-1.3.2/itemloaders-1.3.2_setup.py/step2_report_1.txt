  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python library.\n- No untrusted input, dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present.\n- The dependencies are common and version-locked appropriately.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are detected.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- Confidence scores are 1.0, indicating high certainty based on the provided analysis.\n- The reasoning in each report is consistent and thorough.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- The only point to consider is that setup.py scripts are generally safe, but if they were dynamically constructed or fetched from untrusted sources, that could pose a risk. However, in this case, the code reads only a static README file and uses static configuration data.\n- Since all reports confirm the code is static, standard, and free of malicious patterns, there's no reason to adjust the scores.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a typical, safe, and well-structured setup script for a Python package. All evidence points to a legitimate package configuration with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No adjustments needed to the scores.\n- The overall security posture of this setup script is benign.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis setup.py is safe, standard, and poses no security risks.",
