  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code, a standard `setup.py` for packaging a Python library.\n- No dynamic code, user input, network activity, or obfuscation is present.\n- The code reads a static README file, sets package metadata, and dependencies—typical for a setup script.\n- No suspicious patterns, secrets, or malicious behaviors are detected.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code matches the provided \"Original Code.\" No discrepancies or issues are present.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None of the reports indicate any malicious activity. All point to standard packaging practices.\n- **Security risks:** None are identified; all reports assign a risk score of 0.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- No logical flaws, errors, or suspicious patterns are evident in the reports or code.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign:\n  - **malware:** 0\n  - **obfuscated:** 0\n  - **securityRisk:** 0\n  - **confidence:** 1.0\n\nThese are reasonable given the analysis.\n\n### Justification for higher scores:\n- Since there's no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks, increasing scores isn't justified.\n\n### Critical points:\n- The reports are consistent, thorough, and correctly interpret the code.\n- The code is a typical setup script with no signs of malicious intent.\n- The dependency versions are within reasonable bounds, and no untrusted data handling occurs.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Estimated scores based on analysis:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No modifications to the scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- All reports correctly identify the code as a standard, benign setup script.\n- No suspicious behavior, malicious activity, or obfuscation is present.\n- The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain as-is.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the scores at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.",
