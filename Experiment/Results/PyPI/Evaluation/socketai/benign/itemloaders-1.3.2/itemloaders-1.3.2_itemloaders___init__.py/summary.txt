  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard web scraping utility with no embedded malicious activity or obfuscation. The low risk score appropriately reflects the potential for misuse if untrusted user inputs are supplied as expressions or processors, but the code itself is safe. The malware and obfuscated scores are justified as zero. Overall, the assessments are accurate and justified."
