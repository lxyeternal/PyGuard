  "purpose": "Utility function to wrap functions with loader_context parameter using introspection and partial application.",
  "sources": "Function arguments inspected via get_func_args to determine presence of 'loader_context'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; function wraps other functions without data manipulation.",
  "flows": "Inspects function parameters -> decides to wrap with partial -> returns wrapped or original function.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code straightforwardly inspects a function for 'loader_context' argument and wraps it with functools.partial if present. It relies on get_func_args for parameter inspection, which is standard. No malicious activity, data leaks, or obfuscation are present. The logic is simple and safe, with no network calls or sensitive data handling. The scores in the reports align with this benign assessment, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and risk scores very low. Minor variations in confidence and risk scores are acceptable, but overall, the code is safe and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for context injection, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
