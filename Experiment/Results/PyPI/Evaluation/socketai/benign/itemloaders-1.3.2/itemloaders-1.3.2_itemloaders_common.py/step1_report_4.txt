{
  "purpose": "The code provides a utility to wrap functions so they automatically receive a loader context, simplifying function calls within an item loader framework.",
  "sources": "It reads function definitions and function argument lists via get_func_args, and accesses the 'loader_context' parameter.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks are present; the code only manipulates functions and context objects internally.",
  "flows": "The code checks if a function accepts a 'loader_context' argument, then creates a partial function with this context bound; otherwise, it returns the original function.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs are present. Usage of 'partial' is standard. Reliance on get_func_args might be unconventional but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a wrapper to inject a context into functions that require it. It checks if 'loader_context' is among the function's arguments using get_func_args. If present, it uses functools.partial to bind the context; if not, it returns the original function unchanged. No malicious code, data leaks, or obfuscation are present. No external network calls, no credential handling, and no suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate utility function for simplifying context passing in an item loader framework. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
