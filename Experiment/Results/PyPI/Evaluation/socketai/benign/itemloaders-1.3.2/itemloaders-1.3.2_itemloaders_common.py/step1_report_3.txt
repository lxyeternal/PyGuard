{
  "purpose": "Provides utility to wrap functions so they can receive a loader context as a pre-loaded argument",
  "sources": "Import statements and get_func_args function from itemloaders.utils",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; function wrapping and partial application used for context injection",
  "flows": "Wraps a given function with a pre-loaded loader_context if the function expects loader_context as a parameter",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated patterns; straightforward utility function",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a function to wrap other functions with a pre-loaded context if they accept a loader_context parameter. It uses get_func_args to determine function parameters and functools.partial to inject context. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities. The purpose appears to be standard utility code for handling context passing in a loader framework.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign utility function with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply wraps functions to include context, which is typical in framework code.",
