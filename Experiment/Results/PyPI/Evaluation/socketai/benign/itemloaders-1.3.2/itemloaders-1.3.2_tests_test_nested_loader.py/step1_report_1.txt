  "purpose": "Unit tests for the 'parsel' and 'itemloaders' libraries to validate nested XPath and CSS selectors, item loading, and output retrieval.",
  "sources": "Reads HTML content from a hardcoded HTML string in the Selector object; no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "Method calls such as add_xpath, add_css, add_value, and get_output_value, which process or retrieve data within the test framework.",
  "flows": "Selector parses static HTML -> ItemLoader and nested loaders add or replace XPath/CSS queries -> Output values are retrieved for assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious payloads detected. Usage of standard libraries and testing methods.",
  "analysis": "The code performs structured unit testing for HTML parsing and item loading functionality. It uses predefined static HTML data, and all operations are confined to data manipulation within the test framework. No dynamic execution, external data sources, or suspicious behavior is present. The functions perform expected parsing and data extraction tasks without malicious intent. The overall structure is typical for testing libraries, and no anomalies or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of unit tests for parsing and data extraction libraries. It contains no malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code is benign and solely intended for validation purposes.",
