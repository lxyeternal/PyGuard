  "purpose": "Unit tests for 'parsel' and 'itemloaders' libraries parsing static HTML content.",
  "sources": "Static HTML strings within test cases.",
  "sinks": "In-memory data processing; no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Data flows from static HTML input through parsing and selector methods to output values.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard unit testing of HTML parsing functionalities using static HTML data. No external data sources, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present. The code uses well-known libraries and follows typical testing patterns. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are observed. The data is confined to in-memory processing, and all operations are benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of unit tests for parsing libraries with no malicious intent or security risks. The current scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are accurate and justified.",
