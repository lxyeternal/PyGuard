  "purpose": "Provides data processing classes for item loaders, including composition, transformation, and querying of data.",
  "sources": "Function arguments, external libraries (itemloaders.common, itemloaders.utils, jmespath), class method inputs.",
  "sinks": "None external; data flows through function calls and method parameters.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed through chained functions, with exception handling; data is queried via jmespath; results are returned or joined.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines standard data processing classes with clear, well-documented logic. It uses common Python patterns and external libraries safely. Exception handling is in place to prevent crashes. No network, file, or system modifications are present. The use of jmespath is safe and appropriate for JSON querying. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and safe for use in data processing workflows. No malicious intent or security vulnerabilities are present.",
