{
  "purpose": "Provide various data processing classes for Item Loaders, including function composition, selection, and transformation.",
  "sources": "Input data is received via __call__ methods of each class, typically from external data sources or pipeline inputs.",
  "sinks": "Data outputs are returned directly by the __call__ methods; no external sinks or data exfiltration points are explicitly coded.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into classes like MapCompose, Compose, SelectJmes, and Join; these process data through function calls and return processed results.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are observed. The code uses standard libraries and patterns; no obfuscated code or hidden mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple processing classes intended for data transformation in web scraping or data extraction workflows. Each class operates on provided data, applying user-defined functions, selectors, or joining strings. No external network calls, file manipulations, or environment variable accesses are present. The use of 'import jmespath' appears standard for JSON querying. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are detected. The overall structure and logic are consistent with typical data processing modules, with no suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of data processors for item loaders, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign, well-structured utility module with no immediate threats identified.",
