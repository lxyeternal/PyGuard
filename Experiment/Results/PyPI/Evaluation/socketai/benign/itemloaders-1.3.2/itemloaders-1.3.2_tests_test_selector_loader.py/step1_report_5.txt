{
  "purpose": "Unit testing for CustomItemLoader class, testing various selector-based data extraction and transformation methods",
  "sources": "Selectors (HTML and JSON strings), method arguments (XPath, CSS, regex, re.compile), mock selector in test for missing jmespath",
  "sinks": "Output methods (get_output_value) returning extracted data, test assertions verifying output values",
  "flows": "Data extracted via selectors and regex flows into output value collection, then checked against expected values",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. Use of regex and selectors is standard for testing purposes. No unusual code patterns or obfuscation detected. No data leaks or privacy violations.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs unit testing on a custom data loader class for web scraping, verifying correct behavior with various selectors, regexes, and data transformations. It uses standard Python libraries and third-party modules for parsing HTML/JSON and mocking. No malicious logic, backdoors, or suspicious data handling present. Tests are designed to validate the correctness of data extraction methods, not to execute or exfiltrate data or perform malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "This is a comprehensive unit test suite for a web scraping data loader class. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It primarily verifies data extraction functionalities. The code appears safe and does not pose security risks.",
