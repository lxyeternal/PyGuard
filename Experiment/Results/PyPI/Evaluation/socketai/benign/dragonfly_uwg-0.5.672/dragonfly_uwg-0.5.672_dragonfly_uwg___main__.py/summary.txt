  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI invocation with no evident malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal and primarily depends on the external 'uwg()' function. The malware score remains at 0, and the obfuscated score at 0. The security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), consistent with the minimal code and reliance on external implementation."
