{
  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for configuring and distributing the 'dragonfly-uwg' package.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description, 'requirements.txt' for dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Reads static files and passes their contents into setuptools.setup(), with no dynamic or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script that reads static files and invokes setuptools.setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. All external files are standard in packaging workflows and contain no evidence of malicious content. The code structure is clear, and the operations are typical for Python package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No further action is necessary.",
