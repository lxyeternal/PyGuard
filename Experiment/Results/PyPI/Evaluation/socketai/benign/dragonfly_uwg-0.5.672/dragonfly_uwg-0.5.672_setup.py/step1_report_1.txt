  "purpose": "Setuptools configuration for packaging the 'dragonfly-uwg' Python project, including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' and 'requirements.txt' files for long description and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; setup configuration and file reading are standard practices.",
  "flows": "Input data from files ('README.md' and 'requirements.txt') are read and assigned to variables, then used in package setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs. Use of external files is standard in setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools', reads external files for description and dependencies, and calls 'setuptools.setup()' with metadata and configuration options. No suspicious behavior or malicious intent is detected. The files read are typical for package setup and do not contain embedded malicious code. The code structure is straightforward and adheres to common packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It solely performs package configuration and metadata definition.",
