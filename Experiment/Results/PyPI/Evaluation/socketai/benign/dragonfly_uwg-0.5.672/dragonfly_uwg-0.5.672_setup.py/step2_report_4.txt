  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully.\n\n**Code Content Review:**\n- The code is a typical setup script for a Python package.\n- It reads \"README.md\" and \"requirements.txt\" files to obtain long description and dependencies.\n- Calls `setuptools.setup()` with package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data manipulation.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n- Uses standard practices for packaging.\n\n**Assessment of the reports:**\n- All five reports conclude that the code is standard, benign, and performs typical setup tasks.\n- They assign a malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0, which aligns with the code's straightforward nature.\n- All reports have high confidence (1), and no anomalies are detected.\n- The purpose, sources, flows, and analysis are consistent across reports, emphasizing the benign nature.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The code does not contain any malicious logic or suspicious behavior.\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis correctly identifies the script as standard packaging code.\n\n**Final evaluation:**\n- The code is a conventional setup script.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that. No changes are necessary.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis setup script is a standard, safe package configuration with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
