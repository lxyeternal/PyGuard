  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward wrapper for executing external UWG simulations. No malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are detected. The primary security concern relates to subprocess command construction and environment variable handling, which could be exploited if inputs are compromised. Scores are appropriately assigned: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 (or slightly higher if considering potential command injection). Overall, the code is safe in its current form but should be used with trusted inputs and possibly improved with input validation to mitigate risks."
