  "purpose": "This module provides functions to run the Urban Weather Generator (UWG) simulation using model data and generate morphed EPW files, compatible across different operating systems.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters such as model object, EPW file path, simulation parameters, and environment variables. Accesses environment variables and filesystem paths.",
  "sinks": "Executes subprocesses to run external commands for the UWG simulation. Reads environment variables and filesystem files. Writes JSON configuration files and shell scripts.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (model, file paths, env vars) -> generate UWG JSON -> execute subprocess command (Windows or Unix) -> generate morphed EPW file.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess to invoke external scripts/commands with dynamically constructed command strings. Shell scripts are written and executed on Unix. Environment variables are manipulated (e.g., setting PYTHONHOME to empty).",
  "analysis": "The code primarily orchestrates external command execution for UWG simulations. It constructs commands dynamically based on input parameters and runs them via subprocess. The environment variable PYTHONHOME is cleared before execution, possibly to avoid interference. Shell scripts are generated and executed on Unix systems, and subprocess calls are used to invoke Python with specific modules. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are observed. The subprocess commands are constructed from input parameters but do not incorporate untrusted user data directly; they use file paths and fixed executable paths. The code does not appear to perform data leakage, reverse shell, or malicious system modifications. Environment variable manipulations and subprocess executions are typical for such workflows and do not suggest malicious intent. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or data theft mechanisms are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as an orchestrator for running external UWG simulations across different OS platforms. It employs standard subprocess calls and file operations, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The only noteworthy aspect is subprocess invocation, which is typical for such automation tasks and does not in itself indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code appears benign and solely focused on simulation execution.",
