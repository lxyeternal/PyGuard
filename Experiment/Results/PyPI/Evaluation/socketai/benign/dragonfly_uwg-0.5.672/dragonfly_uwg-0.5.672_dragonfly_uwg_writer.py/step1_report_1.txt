  "purpose": "Convert a Model object into a UWG-compatible dictionary for simulation purposes, incorporating parameters and model properties.",
  "sources": "model.units, model properties (model.properties.uwg), simulation_parameter, epw_file",
  "sinks": "uwg_dict update operations, model duplication and conversion methods, average_shgc calculation, returning uwg_dict",
  "flows": "model.duplicate()/convert_to_units() -> uwg_dict.update() -> uwg_dict['shgc'] = ... -> return uwg_dict",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed; static property values are standard configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code converts a model into a dictionary suitable for UWG simulation, ensuring units are meters, and adds various simulation parameters and static properties. It retrieves model properties and updates a dictionary accordingly. No untrusted input handling or external network access is present. The code uses class methods for data processing and static values for configuration settings, which are typical in such scripts. No signs of malicious intent or obfuscation are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility function for preparing simulation input data. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It performs data manipulation and property extraction in a controlled manner, with no external or unsafe operations.",
