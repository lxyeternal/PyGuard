  "purpose": "Convert a model into a UWG-compatible dictionary for simulation, including handling units, parameters, and climate data.",
  "sources": "Reads model properties, units, and simulation parameters; reads and processes the epw file path.",
  "sinks": "Returns a dictionary; no direct untrusted data sinks such as network or file writes are present.",
  "flows": "Input model and parameters -> process data -> return dictionary; no external data flow beyond function arguments.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code; no code injection, dynamic execution, or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manipulates input objects, checks units, duplicates models, retrieves properties, and constructs a dictionary. It updates model data with simulation parameters and climate info, and adds fixed property values. There are no external network operations, no handling of untrusted user input, and no suspicious code patterns. The use of local variables and property calls appears standard for a simulation setup. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility function for preparing simulation data, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
