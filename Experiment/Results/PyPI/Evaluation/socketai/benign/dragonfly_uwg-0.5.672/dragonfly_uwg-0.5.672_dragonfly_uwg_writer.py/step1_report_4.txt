  "purpose": "Generate a UWG configuration dictionary from a model and parameters for simulation.",
  "sources": "Model properties, simulation parameters, and input files such as epw_file.",
  "sinks": "Returns a dictionary that can be serialized into a JSON file for UWG simulation; no data leaks or external data manipulations are evident.",
  "flows": "Model properties -> uwg_dict; simulation parameters -> uwg_dict; epw_file used to generate simulation dict; final dictionary returned.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious data handling observed. The code straightforwardly converts model data into a dictionary format.",
  "analysis": "The code starts by checking model units and duplicates the model if necessary, which is standard practice. It constructs a dictionary from the model properties, updates it with simulation parameters or defaults, and calculates an average SHGC value. Several static property assignments are made, such as setting 'dtweather', 'autosize', 'sensocc', etc., which are fixed configuration values. The function ultimately returns this assembled dictionary, intended for JSON serialization for UWG simulations. There are no external data injections, network calls, or unsafe data handling. The code appears to be a well-structured, conventional data transformation routine.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data processing function with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply converts model data and parameters into a configuration dictionary for simulation purposes.",
