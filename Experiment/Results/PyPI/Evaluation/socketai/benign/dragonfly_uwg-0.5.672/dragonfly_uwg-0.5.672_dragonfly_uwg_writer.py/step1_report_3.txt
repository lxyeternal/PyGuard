  "purpose": "Generate a UWG configuration dictionary from a model, including simulation parameters and environmental settings.",
  "sources": "model.duplicate(), model.convert_to_units(), model.properties.uwg.to_uwg_dict(), model.properties.uwg.average_shgc(), and the input parameters epw_file and simulation_parameter.",
  "sinks": "The returned uwg_dict which could be serialized into a JSON for UWG simulation; no external sinks are directly present in the code.",
  "flows": "Input: model, epw_file, simulation_parameter -> Processes: model duplication and conversion -> Extraction of uwg dict -> Calculation of average SHGC -> Assembly of final dictionary -> Output uwg_dict.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious external network calls.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data processing: duplicating and converting model units, extracting and updating a dictionary with simulation parameters, computing average SHGC, and adding fixed property values. All operations are contained within the application logic, with no external data sources, external code execution, or suspicious modifications. The usage of model properties and simulation parameters appears legitimate and straightforward. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical configuration generator for a simulation setup, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It operates within expected parameters, handling data transformation and dictionary assembly securely.",
