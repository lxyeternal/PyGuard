  "purpose": "A class representing traffic heat flux parameters within an urban environment, including schedules and validation routines.",
  "sources": "Input parameters during initialization, property setters, and the from_dict method reading dictionaries for configuration data.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; data validation functions are used internally, with no network or file I/O.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through validation functions into internal attributes, then accessed via properties or serialized via to_dict.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; use of 'autocalculate' as a sentinel value is standard. No obfuscation or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward data container with validation routines for schedule lists and numerical inputs. It uses external modules for validation, which are assumed reputable. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation present. The default schedules are static tuples, and the 'autocalculate' sentinel is a common pattern. Validation ensures schedule length and value ranges, with proper property management. No external data sinks or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured configuration class for urban traffic heat flux parameters. It contains no malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0 and low security risk scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
