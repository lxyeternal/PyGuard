  "malware": 0,

  "securityRisk": 0.1,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "purpose": "The code defines a Terrain class for representing and manipulating terrain geometry with properties such as albedo, thickness, and conductivity.",
  "sources": "Input data from Face3D objects, property setters, from_dict, from_building_bounding_rect methods.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data leaks or system interactions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input geometry and parameters through validation and transformation methods, with internal state updates.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard geometric operations, input validation, and serialization. No network activity, code injection, or malicious behavior is present. The handling of untrusted data via setters and from_dict is typical but does not introduce vulnerabilities. The code is clear, well-structured, and relies on external libraries for geometry processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The minimal security risk score reflects cautious handling of untrusted input but does not indicate actual vulnerabilities.",
  "model": "gpt-4.1-nano",
