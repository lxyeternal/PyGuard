  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the evidence and scoring rationale.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe only a docstring comment with no executable code, data input/output, or suspicious patterns.\n- The scores for obfuscated code, malware, and security risk are consistently zero across all reports.\n- Confidence scores are high, reflecting the certainty that the snippet is benign based on its content.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence:** The provided snippet contains only a comment string, no functions, classes, variables, or logic.\n- **Malicious activity:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are evident.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** No evidence of vulnerabilities, data leaks, or security issues.\n\n### Potential issues or flaws:\n- The reports correctly identify the absence of executable code, input/output handling, or suspicious patterns.\n- Since the code is purely a comment, the risk of malicious activity is effectively zero.\n- The scoring of malware (0) and obfuscated (0) is appropriate.\n- The security risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n### Score justifications:\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are reasonable and consistent with the content.\n- Confidence scores are high, given the clarity of the content.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- No adjustments needed; the assessments are accurate.\n- The high confidence scores reflect the certainty that the snippet is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The code snippet is harmless, consisting solely of descriptive comments. There are no signs of malicious or obfuscated code, and the security risk is negligible.\n\n**Note:** If future code snippets contain actual implementation, input/output handling, or suspicious patterns, scores should be re-evaluated accordingly.",
