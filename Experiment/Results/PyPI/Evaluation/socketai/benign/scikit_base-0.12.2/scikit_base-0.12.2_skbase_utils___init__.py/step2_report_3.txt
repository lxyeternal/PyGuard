  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall Code Content:**\n- The code is a simple Python module that imports utility functions from internal skbase modules, defines author and export lists, and contains no executable logic.\n- There are no data inputs, outputs, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n- All imports are from internal, presumably trusted, modules.\n- No signs of obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** No malicious activity or risks detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, benign utility module, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Also finds no malicious activity, but assigns a securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0\n- **Assessment:** The securityRisk score of 0.1 suggests a very minor concern, but given the code is just imports and metadata, this seems unjustified. No actual security risk exists here. The malware score remains 0, which is correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Same as above, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same as previous, benign utility module.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, consistent with the straightforward import statements.\n- **Security Risk:** Most reports assign 0, except Report 3, which assigns 0.1. Given the code's simplicity, this seems unwarranted.\n\n### Recommendations\n\n- The **securityRisk** score of 0.1 in Report 3 is not justified based on the code. It should be 0, consistent with the other reports and the actual code content.\n- No report suggests any suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n\n### Final Estimation\n\nConsidering all reports and the code:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Security Risk:** 0 (no actual security concern)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\nThe code is a benign utility module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The only inconsistency is the slightly elevated securityRisk score in Report 3, which should be adjusted to 0.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Security risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's simplicity and the thorough analysis.",
