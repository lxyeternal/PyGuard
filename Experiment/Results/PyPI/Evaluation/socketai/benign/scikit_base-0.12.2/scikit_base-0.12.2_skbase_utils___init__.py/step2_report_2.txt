  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code is a straightforward Python module that:\n  - Imports several utility functions from internal `skbase.utils` submodules.\n  - Defines `__author__` and `__all__` for module metadata and export control.\n- There are no executable statements, data processing, network calls, or dynamic code.\n- All imported modules are internal utility functions, presumed safe.\n- No signs of obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  No. All reports consistently describe this as a benign, standard utility module with no malicious or suspicious activity.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  No. The reports correctly identify that the code only performs safe imports and metadata definitions.\n\n- **Scores assigned in the reports?**  \n  - All reports assign `malware` scores of 0 or 0.1, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n  - `securityRisk` scores are very low or zero, consistent with the benign nature.\n  - `obfuscated` scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5?**  \n  None of the reports suggest any risk that warrants a higher score. The highest `securityRisk` is 0.1, which is reasonable given the code's simplicity.\n\n- **Malware scores?**  \n  All are 0 or 0.1, which is appropriate. There is no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. The reports do not rely on assumptions; they correctly observe that the code is standard and safe.\n\n- **Consistency of scores with the report?**  \n  Yes. The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The code is a typical utility module for internal use, with no suspicious elements.\n- No vulnerabilities or attack vectors are apparent.\n- The internal functions imported are presumed safe, given their purpose and origin.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n**The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.** The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified based on the code content.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign nature of the code and align with the detailed analysis provided.",
