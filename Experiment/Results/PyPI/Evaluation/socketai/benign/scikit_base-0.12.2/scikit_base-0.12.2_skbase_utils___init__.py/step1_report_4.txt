  "purpose": "Utility functions used throughout the skbase library for data manipulation, randomness control, and comparisons.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal skbase modules (_iter, _nested_iter, _utils, deep_equals, random_state). No input reading or data sources are present in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations are present in this code segment.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code consists solely of import statements and module metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors observed. The code mainly contains standard imports and metadata annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module declaration with import statements from internal utility modules and author/version metadata. No executable logic, data handling, or potential attack vectors are present. The imported functions are utility in nature and are unlikely to contain malicious code given their descriptions. The code does not include any dynamic execution, data processing, or external communication. It appears to be a standard, benign module setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as a collection point for utility functions within the skbase package and contains only safe import statements and metadata.",
