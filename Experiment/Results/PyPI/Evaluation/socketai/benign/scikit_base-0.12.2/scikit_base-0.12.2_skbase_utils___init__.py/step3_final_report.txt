  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for internal use within skbase, organizing imports and metadata.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal skbase utility modules.",
  "sinks": "No data inputs or outputs; no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "None; the code only imports functions and defines metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and metadata definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports internal utility functions, defines author and export lists, and contains no executable logic or external interactions. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present. The imported modules are internal and presumed safe. The code's purpose is organizational, exposing utility functions for internal use. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detectable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and intent.",
