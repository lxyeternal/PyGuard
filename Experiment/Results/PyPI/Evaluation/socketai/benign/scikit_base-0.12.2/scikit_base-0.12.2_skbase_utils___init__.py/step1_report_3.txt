  "purpose": "Utility functions for the skbase library, providing helpers for data manipulation, random state management, and deep equality checks.",
  "sources": "Import statements from skbase.utils modules, including make_strings_unique, flatten, is_flat, unflat_len, unflatten, subset_dict_keys, deep_equals, check_random_state, sample_dependent_seed, set_random_state.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks; no network communication, file writing, or execution of untrusted input observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from imported utility functions and types, but no untrusted input sources or data manipulation is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected. The code solely defines imports and exports for utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily contains import statements and module-level variable definitions (__author__, __all__). It does not include executable code, data processing, or dynamic execution. All imported modules are from the skbase package, which appears to be a standard, purpose-built library. No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or code injections are present. The code is clean, straightforward, and adheres to standard practices for utility module definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply imports and exports functions, with no suspicious or malicious activity detectable.",
