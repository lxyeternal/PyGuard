  "purpose": "Utility functions for the skbase library, providing data manipulation, deep comparison, and random state management.",
  "sources": "Imports from skbase.utils modules and standard typing annotations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to critical functions or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears straightforward, importing utility functions; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, type annotations, and defining __author__ and __all__ variables. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling from external sources is present. All imported modules are from the same library (skbase) and are utility functions, indicating modular design. No suspicious or malicious patterns are observed, and no obfuscation or complex dynamic code exists.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for a utility module, importing various helper functions and setting module metadata. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected.",
