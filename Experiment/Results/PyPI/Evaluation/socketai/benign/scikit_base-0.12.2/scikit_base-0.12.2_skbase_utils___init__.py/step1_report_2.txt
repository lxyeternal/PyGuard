  "purpose": "Utility functions used within the skbase library for various data processing tasks.",
  "sources": "No input sources; this module primarily imports functions from other skbase utility modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data outputs or untrusted data handling present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths; this module only defines imports and metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard module setup with import statements, author info, and __all__ declaration. It only imports functions from trusted skbase utility modules and defines metadata. There are no input sources, no data flows, no sinks, and no suspicious or malicious code. The purpose appears to be to organize utility functions for use elsewhere, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module with no malicious intent or security risks present. It solely manages imports and metadata without handling untrusted data or performing dangerous operations.",
