  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the details provided and the code itself.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is a simple Python module that imports several utility functions from internal skbase modules.\n- It defines `__author__` and `__all__` for module metadata and exports.\n- There are no data inputs, outputs, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n- All imported functions are from internal, presumably trusted, modules.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports conclude that the code is benign, with no malicious activity or security risks. This aligns with the code content.\n\n- **Are there errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No. The reports correctly identify the code as a straightforward utility module with no suspicious elements.\n\n- **Are the scores assigned reasonable?**  \n  - **Malware score:** consistently 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n  - **Obfuscated score:** 0, also correct.\n  - **Security risk:** mostly 0 or very low (0.1), which is reasonable.\n\n- **Justification for high risk scores (>0.5):**  \n  None of the reports assign high scores; all are at 0 or near 0, which is justified.\n\n- **Malware claims:**  \n  No malware is claimed or implied; the code is standard utility imports.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n  No suspicious assumptions are made; all reports correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The code is a standard utility module, with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky components.\n- The import statements are from internal, trusted modules.\n- No dynamic or external code execution is present.\n- The purpose is clear: organizing utility functions for internal use.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (or very close to 0, e.g., 0.1 at most, due to minimal metadata risk)\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate and consistent with the code.** There are no signs of malicious activity or security issues.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\nBased on the thorough review, I would assign:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is purely a benign utility module with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe, straightforward, and standard.\n- No changes needed to the existing scores.\n- The reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code.\n\n**Final note:** Always continue to monitor for dynamic behaviors or dependencies, but based on static analysis, this code poses no security threat.",
