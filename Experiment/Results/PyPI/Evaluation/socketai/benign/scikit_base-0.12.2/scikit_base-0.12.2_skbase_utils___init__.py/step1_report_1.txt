  "purpose": "Utility functions used within the skbase library for data processing, iteration, and random state management.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; only imports from internal modules and metadata definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing; no network or system commands present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; code only imports and defines module metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors detected. The imports are from internal, presumably safe, modules.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several utility functions from internal skbase modules related to iteration, deep equality, randomness, and dictionary operations. It defines author and export lists. There are no dynamic code execution, network calls, or file operations. All elements appear standard for a utility module, with no signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility module setup with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply imports and exposes utility functions for internal use. There are no suspicious, backdoored, or malicious components identified.",
