    "Function parameters 'random_state' and 'seed' used as input sources.",
    "Estimator's get_params method for retrieving configuration parameters.",
    "Internal function 'check_random_state' which processes 'random_state' or 'seed'."

    "estimator.set_params() - where parameters including 'random_state' are set.",
    "hashlib.sha256() - used to generate dependent pseudo-random seeds."

  "flows": [
    "Input 'random_state' (or 'seed') flows into 'check_random_state' to produce a numpy RandomState object.",
    "The RandomState is used in 'sample_dependent_seed' to generate multiple seeds via hashing.",
    "Generated seeds are assigned to estimator's 'random_state' or related parameters via 'set_params'."
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "Code resets any estimator’s 'random_state' regardless of whether it supports randomness (via 'set_params' even if 'random_state' is unsupported).",
    "Use of cryptographic hash functions to generate dependent seeds from an initial seed is an unusual pattern outside cryptography or security contexts, but here it appears intended for deterministic seed generation.",
    "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; the code primarily handles seed generation and assignment."
  ],
  "analysis": "The code provides utilities for managing pseudo-random seeds in estimators, ensuring reproducibility. It processes input seeds into numpy RandomState objects, generates multiple dependent seeds via secure hashing, and assigns these seeds to estimator parameters. There are no signs of malicious activities such as network communication, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The use of cryptographic hashing for seed derivation is intended for generating independent pseudo-random seeds, which is a benign, deterministic pattern. The code does reset 'random_state' parameters even if not supported, which could cause unexpected behavior but not malicious harm. Overall, the code’s functionality is consistent with secure seed management, with no evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements seed management utilities for reproducible randomness in machine learning estimators. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks, but it resets 'random_state' parameters unconditionally, which could lead to side effects. The use of cryptographic hashing for seed derivation appears benign and intended for deterministic seed generation.",
