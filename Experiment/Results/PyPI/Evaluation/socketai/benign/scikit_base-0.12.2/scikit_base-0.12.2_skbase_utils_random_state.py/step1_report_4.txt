  "flows": [
    "Input parameters (`random_state`, `seed`) -> `check_random_state()` produces a RandomState object -> `get_params()` retrieves estimator parameters -> Seeds are generated via `sample_dependent_seed()` -> Seeds are assigned to estimator parameters via `set_params()`"

  "anomalies": [
    "Use of cryptographic hashing (`hashlib.sha256`) to generate dependent seeds, which is unusual but not inherently malicious.",
    "The code resets `random_state` based on input, which is standard for reproducibility but could be misused in malicious contexts if misrepresented.",
    "The function `sample_dependent_seed()` uses recursive calls without explicit checks for seed value types, but this is benign in context."
  ],
  "analysis": "The code is designed for deterministic control of random states in estimators, using cryptographic hashing to generate dependent but pseudo-random seeds. It handles seed initialization securely and provides options for deep or shallow application. No network operations, data exfiltration, or malicious backdoors are present. Use of hashing for seed generation is standard for reproducible experiments. The only unusual aspect is the cryptographic seed derivation, which, while not common in typical scikit-learn workflows, is not inherently malicious. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data theft, remote control, or system damage.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements seed setting and generation functions for reproducible randomness, employing cryptographic hashing to produce dependent seeds. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware indicators. Its purpose is for controlled randomness in estimators, with no signs of security threats.",
