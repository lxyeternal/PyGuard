  "anomalies": [
    "Use of cryptographic hashing (SHA-256) for seed generation is standard; no malicious intent detected.",
    "The code forcibly resets 'random_state' parameters in estimators, which is standard for reproducibility but may override user configurations.",
    "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious network activity observed.",
    "All imports and code logic are consistent with utility functions for randomness management."
  ],
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for managing random seeds in estimators, ensuring reproducibility through deterministic seed generation via cryptographic hashing. The functions include 'set_random_state' which modifies estimator parameters, 'check_random_state' to standardize seed inputs, and 'sample_dependent_seed' to generate dependent pseudo-random seeds. No data is transmitted externally, no network calls or system modifications are present. Use of cryptographic hashing for seed derivation is secure and intended for independence of pseudo-random sequences. There are no signs of malicious code such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or system damage mechanisms. The code appears well-structured, documented, and aligned with standard practices for seed management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for seed management in estimators with no malicious intent. It employs cryptographic hashing to generate independent seeds, ensuring deterministic and reproducible randomness. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected.",
