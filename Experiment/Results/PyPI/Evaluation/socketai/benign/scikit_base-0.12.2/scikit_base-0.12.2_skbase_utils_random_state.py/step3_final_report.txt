  "sinks": "estimator.set_params() where random_state parameters are set",
  "flows": "random_state input -> check_random_state -> sample_dependent_seed -> set_params in estimator",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional resetting of 'random_state' parameters even if not supported by the estimator; use of cryptographic hashing for seed derivation outside cryptography context",
  "analysis": "The code provides functions to manage random seed states, employing cryptographic hashing to generate deterministic, independent seeds. It retrieves estimator parameters, generates seeds, and sets them, ensuring reproducibility. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. The unconditional resetting of 'random_state' parameters could cause side effects but not security issues. The use of hashlib.sha256 for seed derivation is benign, though somewhat unusual outside cryptography. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0, low security risks (~0.1-0.2), and high confidence. No obfuscation or malicious intent is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure utility for managing randomness in estimators. It employs cryptographic hashing for deterministic seed generation, with no malicious activity or backdoors. The minor security risk score reflects potential side effects of parameter overwriting, not malicious intent. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for reproducibility tasks.",
