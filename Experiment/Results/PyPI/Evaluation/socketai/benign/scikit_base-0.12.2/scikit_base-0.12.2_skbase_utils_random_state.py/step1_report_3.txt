  "anomalies": [
    "No hardcoded secrets or credentials present.",
    "Use of cryptographic hashing for seed generation is standard; no obfuscation or unusual code patterns observed.",
    "The code performs seed sampling using standard libraries and techniques, with no hidden or malicious behavior.",
    "No obfuscated or confusing language features; straightforward implementation."
  ],
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions to set random seed states for estimators, supporting reproducibility and independent randomness via cryptographic hashing. It uses 'hashlib.sha256' to generate dependent seeds, which is a standard secure practice. No suspicious or malicious code is evident; the functions merely manage seed values and use cryptographic hash functions to produce consistent, pseudo-random seeds. There are no indications of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors. The code’s purpose is aligned with reproducible machine learning workflows and does not exhibit obfuscation or malware characteristics.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for managing random seed states with cryptographically sound seed generation methods. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. Its purpose is transparent, and no anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
