{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for working with sequences, including conversion, formatting, and ensuring string uniqueness.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions (e.g., scalar, sequence, type info), imported modules, and regular expression matching within _remove_type_text.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions involve untrusted data flows that lead to data leaks, command execution, or harmful system effects.",
  "flows": "The code primarily processes data for formatting and transformation without external data flow or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code relies on standard libraries and performs expected utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several utility functions: _scalar_to_seq converts scalars to sequences; _remove_type_text extracts class names; _format_seq_to_str formats sequences into strings; make_strings_unique ensures string list uniqueness. All functions operate on provided data with no external input-output interactions. No evidence of data exfiltration, malicious code, or sabotage behaviors. Use of regular expressions is safe and confined to formatting logic. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions for sequence handling, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
