{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for working with sequences, including conversion, formatting, and ensuring string uniqueness.",
  "sources": "None of the functions read untrusted external input; they operate on provided parameters and internal variables.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions write to external systems, perform network communication, or handle sensitive data.",
  "flows": "The code mainly processes data within its functions without external data flows or untrusted source-to-sink paths.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are present. Usage of regex for type string cleanup is standard. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several utility functions: _scalar_to_seq for scalar-to-sequence conversion with type checks, _remove_type_text for type string cleanup, _format_seq_to_str for sequence formatting, and make_strings_unique to ensure string list uniqueness. All functions rely on standard Python libraries, perform predictable operations, and do not perform any malicious activity. No external input handling, network operations, or security-sensitive actions are present. The functions are well-structured and adhere to typical coding standards for utility modules.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward utility module for sequence operations with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and standard for use in larger projects.",
