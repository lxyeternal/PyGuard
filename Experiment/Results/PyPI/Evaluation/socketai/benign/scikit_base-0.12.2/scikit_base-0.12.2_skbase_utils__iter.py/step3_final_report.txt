  "purpose": "Utility functions for sequence handling, string formatting, and ensuring string uniqueness in Python code.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions such as 'scalar', 'input_', 'seq', and 'str_list'; regex matching in '_remove_type_text'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, external data flows, or system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through processing functions; no external or network data flows are detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious code behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions with clear, standard logic for sequence conversion, string formatting, and string list uniqueness. No external data, network calls, or system modifications are involved. Regex usage is limited to formatting, and functions operate solely on provided data. No obfuscation, malicious patterns, or vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The high confidence scores are justified, and no logical errors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility module with no malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. The existing reports accurately assess its safety, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
