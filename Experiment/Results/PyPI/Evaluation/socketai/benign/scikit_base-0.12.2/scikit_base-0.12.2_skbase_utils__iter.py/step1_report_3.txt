  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling sequences, formatting, and making string lists unique within the skbase library.",
  "sources": "The code reads from input parameters such as 'scalar', 'input_', 'seq', 'str_list', and 'x'. No external untrusted data sources are directly used.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes untrusted data to external systems or performs dangerous actions like system modification, network access, or file I/O. It primarily processes data in-memory.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through validation and transformation functions; no external data flow or command execution occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected. Code adheres to standard sequence and string handling routines.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of sequence manipulation functions such as converting scalars to sequences, formatting sequences into strings, and ensuring string list uniqueness. These functions perform input validation, string processing with regex, and recursion for making strings unique. No use of external resources, network, file system, or security-sensitive operations are present. Functions are standard, safe, and do not exhibit obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of safe utility functions for sequence and string handling, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs expected operations in a secure manner without side effects.",
