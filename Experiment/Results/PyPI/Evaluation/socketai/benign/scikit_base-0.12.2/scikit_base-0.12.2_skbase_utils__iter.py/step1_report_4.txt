  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling sequences, formatting, and ensuring string uniqueness within the skbase library.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries and internal skbase modules; input parameters for functions.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or network calls; functions mainly manipulate data in-memory.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into functions like _scalar_to_seq, _format_seq_to_str, and make_strings_unique; processed data is returned or transformed within these functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. No external network or file system interactions are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard sequence handling utilities, with functions converting scalars to sequences, formatting sequences as strings, removing type annotations from string representations, and ensuring string elements are unique. No code injection, malicious data exfiltration, or external communications are present. The functions perform straightforward data manipulations, with input validation and formatting. No anomalies such as hidden backdoors or malicious code logic were found. The code is well-structured, with no suspicious behavior or security risks detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of utility functions for sequence and string handling within the skbase library. It performs standard data processing tasks without any malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. No malicious behavior or security threats are identified.",
