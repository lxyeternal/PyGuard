{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for working with sequences, including type conversions, formatting, and making strings unique.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions such as '_scalar_to_seq', '_remove_type_text', '_format_seq_to_str', and 'make_strings_unique'; internal regex matching; collection counters.",
  "sinks": "None identified that lead to data leaks or system effects; functions primarily process data internally without external interactions.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into functions where they are converted, formatted, or manipulated; no external data flow to network or system resources detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as dynamic code execution, network connections, or backdoors. The code mainly handles sequence formatting and string manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of sequence processing utilities: converting scalars to sequences, removing type text, formatting sequences to strings, and ensuring string uniqueness. All functions operate locally, with regex for type string cleanup, collections for counting, and standard Python sequence operations. No evidence of code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials, network calls, or backdoors present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for sequence and string handling without any malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard operations with no suspicious behavior detected.",
