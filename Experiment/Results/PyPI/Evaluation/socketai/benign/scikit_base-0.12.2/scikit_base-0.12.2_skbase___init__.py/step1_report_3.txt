{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a module-level header for the 'skbase' library, providing version info and documentation about its functionality for creating and working with parametric objects.",
  "sources": "The only source of data is the initial comments and the version string assignment, which are static and hardcoded.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks, no untrusted data handling, nor any code that executes external commands or handles user input.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative with no dynamic or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs present. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard Python module conventions.",
  "analysis": "The script contains only a shebang, encoding declaration, license comment, module docstring, and a static version string assignment. There are no functions, classes, or runtime behaviors that could execute malicious actions. The comments and code are typical for open-source Python modules and do not indicate any hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a simple module header and metadata definition without any malicious or security risks.",
