  "purpose": "This code serves as a module header containing metadata, documentation, and version information for the skbase package.",
  "sources": "No input sources; static code with comments, shebang, encoding declaration, and a version variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or external data flows present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code is purely static metadata and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code contains only standard comments, shebang, encoding, docstring, and a version assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Python module header with no functions, dynamic code, or external interactions. It includes a shebang, encoding declaration, license comment, module docstring, and a version string. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the static, metadata-only nature of the code. No suspicious patterns, secrets, or malicious constructs are present. The high confidence scores reflect certainty in its benign status.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module header with no malicious activity or security issues. All reports are accurate and consistent. No further action or modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
