  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it with the code provided.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Shebang: `#!/usr/bin/env python3 -u`\n- Encoding declaration: `# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-`\n- License comment\n- Module docstring describing `skbase`\n- `__version__` variable set to `\"0.12.2\"`\n\n**Key observations:**\n- No functions, classes, or executable code.\n- No data input/output, network calls, or dynamic behavior.\n- All content is static metadata, documentation, or comments.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious constructs, or signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All reports uniformly state that the code is a benign, standard module header with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- They correctly identify that the code contains only static documentation, version info, and licensing comments.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or security risks are detected.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- Malware scores are 0 across all reports, aligning with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n**Any discrepancies or issues?**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are reasonable.\n- The reasoning that the code is purely metadata and documentation is sound.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The code does not perform any operations, so the risk and malware scores should remain at 0.\n- No assumptions about hidden malicious behavior are justified here.\n- The code is typical for a package's initial header.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent with the code provided. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is a standard, benign module header.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No further action needed.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
