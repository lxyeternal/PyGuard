  "purpose": "Documentation and version declaration for the skbase library, providing tools for parametric objects based on scikit-learn and sktime.",
  "sources": "The script reads the script headers, comments, and the __version__ variable assignment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is static and does not process external input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code consists solely of comments, metadata, and a version variable assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and contains only documentation comments, a version string, and licensing information. There are no input operations, data processing, network communications, or execution of dynamic code. The code structure is standard for a library module's initial header.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code fragment is a benign header with no malicious intent, no dynamic or insecure operations. It serves as a descriptive and metadata component for the skbase package.",
