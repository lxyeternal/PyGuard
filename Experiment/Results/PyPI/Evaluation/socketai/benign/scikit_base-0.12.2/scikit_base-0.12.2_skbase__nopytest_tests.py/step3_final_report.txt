{
  "purpose": "The code performs module inspection and method invocation on a BaseObject instance for testing purposes, ensuring module isolation and class method functionality.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'all_objects' function output and method calls on the 'mybo' BaseObject instance with static parameters.",
  "sinks": "Method calls on 'BaseObject' could be sinks if they were malicious, but in this context, they are controlled and benign.",
  "flows": "The code flows from module inspection via 'all_objects' to instantiation of 'BaseObject' and sequential method calls with predefined parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple testing routine that inspects modules and calls class methods with static parameters. No external input, network activity, or malicious logic is involved. The use of 'all_objects' for module crawling is standard in testing. Method calls are safe and do not process untrusted data. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with this benign analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign testing script with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores and assessments in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
