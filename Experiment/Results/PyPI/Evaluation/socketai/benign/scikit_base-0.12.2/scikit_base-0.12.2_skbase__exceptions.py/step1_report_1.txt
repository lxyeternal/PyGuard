{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the skbase library, specifically for fixture generation errors and estimator not fitted errors.",
  "sources": "Import statement for List from typing; class constructor parameters",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data input or output operations, no untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard exception class definitions and simple constructor logic",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward and only defines two custom exception classes inheriting from standard Python exceptions. It includes a constructor for FixtureGenerationError that formats an error message. There are no external data inputs, network operations, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be standard exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks.",
