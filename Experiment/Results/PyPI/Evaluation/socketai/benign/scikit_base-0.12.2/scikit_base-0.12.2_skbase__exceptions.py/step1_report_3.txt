  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for the 'skbase' library, specifically for handling fixture generation failures and usage of estimators before fitting.",
  "sources": "None (no input reading or data sources).",
  "sinks": "None (no output or data leak points).",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data propagation present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code contains standard Python class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from built-in exception classes. No external data input/output, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious behavior observed. Licensing comments and author tags are standard for open-source projects. No malicious or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign implementation of custom exception classes for a Python library. No malicious activity or security issues detected.",
