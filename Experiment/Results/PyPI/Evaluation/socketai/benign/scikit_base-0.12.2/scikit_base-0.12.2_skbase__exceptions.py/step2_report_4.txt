  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully.\n\n1. **Code Review:**\n   - The code defines two custom exception classes:\n     - `FixtureGenerationError` with a constructor that formats an error message.\n     - `NotFittedError` inheriting from `ValueError` and `AttributeError`, with no additional logic.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, no data processing, and no external data handling.\n   - The import is limited to type annotations (`List` from `typing`).\n   - Licensing comments and author tags are standard for open-source projects.\n   - There are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Security and Malware Assessment:**\n   - The code is purely defining exception classes, which are common in Python libraries.\n   - No network operations, file I/O, external data sources, or code execution.\n   - No embedded malicious payloads or suspicious constructs.\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could be exploited or malicious.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - **Malware Score:** Reported as 0 in all cases, which aligns with the analysis; no malicious activity detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** Reported as 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - **Risk Score:** Reported as 0 in all reports, which seems reasonable since the code is benign.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Concerns:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is appropriate.\n   - No reason to adjust scores upward, as the code poses no security threat.\n\n5. **Overall Justification:**\n   - The code is standard, well-documented, and free of malicious content.\n   - The scores assigned are justified and align with the code's nature.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- Based on the analysis, I agree with the current scores:\n  - Malware: 0.0\n  - Obfuscated: 0.0\n  - Risk: 0.0\n\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate and justified.",
