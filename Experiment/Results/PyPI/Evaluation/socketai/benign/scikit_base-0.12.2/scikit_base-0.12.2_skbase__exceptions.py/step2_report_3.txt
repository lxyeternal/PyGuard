  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - The code defines two custom exception classes: `FixtureGenerationError` and `NotFittedError`.\n   - The `FixtureGenerationError` class includes a constructor that formats an error message, which is standard practice.\n   - The `NotFittedError` class inherits from both `ValueError` and `AttributeError`, aligning with scikit-learn's approach.\n   - The code is well-documented, straightforward, and adheres to common Python patterns for custom exceptions.\n   - No dynamic code, data processing, network operations, or external data handling is present.\n\n2. **Security and Malicious Behavior:**\n   - The code is purely defining exception classes with no evidence of malicious intent.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are observed.\n   - The imports and class structures are standard and benign.\n\n3. **Analysis of Reports:**\n   - All reports consistently conclude that the code is standard, benign, and contains no security risks.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1.0, which seems appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious behaviors are identified across reports.\n   - The reports correctly note the absence of untrusted data handling, external data sources, or code execution.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is justified. There is no malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is accurate; the code is not obfuscated.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0.0, which aligns with the analysis; the code does not pose any security risk.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies or Adjustments:**\n   - Given the analysis, the scores are reasonable and consistent.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the assessments appear accurate.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exception classes.\n- No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n- The current scores (malware: 0.0, obfuscated: 0.0, risk: 0.0) are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis code snippet is safe and does not introduce any security concerns.",
