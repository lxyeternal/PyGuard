  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code defines two custom exception classes:\n     - `FixtureGenerationError` with a constructor that formats an error message.\n     - `NotFittedError`, inheriting from `ValueError` and `AttributeError`, with no additional logic.\n   - The code includes standard import statements, author, and API list variables.\n   - There are no external data inputs, network calls, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation.\n   - The code appears to be straightforward, well-documented, and typical for exception handling in a Python library.\n\n2. **Security and Malware Assessment:**\n   - No suspicious patterns, such as code obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No external data handling or untrusted input processing.\n   - The code is purely defining exception classes, which are benign and standard.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - **Malware score:** 0.0 — Correct, no malicious behavior.\n   - **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 — Correct, code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk score:** 0.0 — Appropriate, as the code is benign and does not introduce security vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports uniformly agree that this is standard, benign code with no malicious intent.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious activity, or security risks are present.\n   - The only minor point is that the constructor in `FixtureGenerationError` formats a message that includes `err`, which could be any object. However, this is a common pattern and not inherently risky.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes.\n   - No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n   - The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code content.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 (correct)\n\nThe reports are accurate and do not overstate or understate the security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no security risks or malicious intent. The scoring in the reports aligns well with the actual content.",
