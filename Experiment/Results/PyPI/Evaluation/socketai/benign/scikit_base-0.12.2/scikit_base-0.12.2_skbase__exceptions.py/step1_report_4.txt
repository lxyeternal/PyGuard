{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for skbase library, specifically for fixture generation failures and estimator usage before fitting.",
  "sources": "Import statements for typing.List; class constructors that accept parameters",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data output or external data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; exception classes simply define error types without untrusted data handling",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual patterns; code strictly defines exception classes with standard Python syntax",
  "analysis": "The code provides custom exception definitions inheriting from standard Python exception types. It includes a constructor for FixtureGenerationError that formats an error message. The classes and their methods are straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, external data handling, or security-sensitive operations. The import is limited to type annotations, and no external data sources or sinks are involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious intent, suspicious activity, or security vulnerabilities detected.",
