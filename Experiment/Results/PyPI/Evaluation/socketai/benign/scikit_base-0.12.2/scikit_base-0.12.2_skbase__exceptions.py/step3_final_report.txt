{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for use in the skbase library, specifically FixtureGenerationError and NotFittedError, to handle specific error conditions.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs; class constructors and definitions are static within the code.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any I/O operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only defines classes without data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, well-documented, and standard for exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes, with no dynamic code, external data handling, or suspicious patterns. It is a typical implementation for error handling in Python. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present. The constructor in FixtureGenerationError formats a message with a potentially untrusted object 'err', but this is standard practice and not inherently risky. The code's simplicity and adherence to conventions confirm its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0.0, obfuscated: 0.0, risk: 0.0) are accurate and consistent with the code content.",
