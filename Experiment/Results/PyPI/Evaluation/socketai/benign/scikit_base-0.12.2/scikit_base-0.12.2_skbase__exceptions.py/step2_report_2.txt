  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review & Presence of Issues:**\n   - The code consists solely of two custom exception class definitions: `FixtureGenerationError` and `NotFittedError`.\n   - The `FixtureGenerationError` class includes a constructor that formats an error message, which is standard practice.\n   - The `NotFittedError` class inherits from both `ValueError` and `AttributeError`, aligning with scikit-learn's pattern.\n   - No external data handling, network calls, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation are present.\n   - The code is straightforward, well-documented, and adheres to typical Python conventions.\n\n   **Conclusion:** No issues or malicious elements are present in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and free of security risks.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is purely defining exception classes with no data processing or external interactions.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0.0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0.0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0.0\n   - These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence levels are 1.0, which seems justified.\n\n   **Suggestion:** The scores seem reasonable and consistent across reports.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely defining exception classes with no external interactions or malicious logic, a risk score above 0.0 is unwarranted.\n   - The current scores of 0.0 for malware and security risk are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - No malicious behavior is indicated or implied.\n   - The malware score of 0.0 is accurate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities are made without evidence.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code content.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- **Overall malware score:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0\n- **Risk score:** 0.0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exception classes for a Python library. No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present. The reports correctly identify this and assign appropriate scores.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
