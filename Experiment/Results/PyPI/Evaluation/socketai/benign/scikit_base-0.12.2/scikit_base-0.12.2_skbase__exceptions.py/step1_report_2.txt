{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for the 'skbase' library, specifically for fixture generation failures and estimator not fitted errors.",
  "sources": "Imports 'List' from 'typing' module.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or output points.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines classes and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs; standard exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes custom exception classes for error handling in a Python library. It imports type annotations, defines author and public API lists, and two exception classes with appropriate docstrings. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious intent or security issues.",
