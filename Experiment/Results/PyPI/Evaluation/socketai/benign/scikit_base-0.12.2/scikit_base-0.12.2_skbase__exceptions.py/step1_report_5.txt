{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for use in the skbase library, including error handling for fixture generation failures and estimator usage before fitting.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads untrusted input or data sources; it primarily defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data can lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only sets up exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward class definitions with no obfuscated features or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code contains standard Python class definitions for exceptions, with no input handling, external data reading, or suspicious behavior. It references scikit-learn's conventions but does not perform any data processing, network operations, or file I/O. There are no hardcoded secrets, no code execution, and no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of custom exceptions for a Python library, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
