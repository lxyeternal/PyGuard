  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Purpose**:\n   - The code defines two custom exception classes: `FixtureGenerationError` and `NotFittedError`.\n   - Both classes inherit from standard Python exceptions (`Exception`, `ValueError`, `AttributeError`).\n   - The `FixtureGenerationError` includes a constructor that formats an error message.\n   - The code includes licensing and author metadata, typical for open-source projects.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:\n   - No external data input/output, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n   - Exception classes are straightforward and standard.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports**:\n   - All reports consistently conclude that the code is benign, standard, and has no security risks.\n   - The confidence level is 1.0 across all reports, indicating high certainty.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious code, or security vulnerabilities are identified.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0.0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: 0.0, as there's no obfuscation.\n   - **Risk Score**: 0.0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns**:\n   - The code is minimal and standard; no reason to adjust scores.\n   - The logic and reasoning in the reports are sound and consistent with the code.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - Since the code is purely defining exception classes, the risk of security issues is negligible.\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as non-malicious.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- The malware score should remain at **0.0**.\n- The obfuscated score should remain at **0.0**.\n- The overall security risk should be **0.0**.\n\n**Summary**:\n- The code is a straightforward, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious activity or security vulnerabilities.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No changes to scores are necessary.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n- **Malware score: 0.0**\n- **Obfuscated score: 0.0**\n- **Risk score: 0.0**\n\nThis aligns with the code's benign nature and the thorough review.",
