  "purpose": "A context manager to suppress standard error output (stderr) in Python scripts, allowing code to run without displaying error messages temporarily.",
  "sources": "The class __init__ method reads the 'active' parameter; __enter__ method reads the current sys.stderr; __exit__ method reads exception type, value, traceback; _handle_exit_exceptions method reads exception info.",
  "sinks": "sys.stderr is reassigned to suppress error output; if an exception occurs, _handle_exit_exceptions may process exception information.",
  "flows": "Initialization (__init__) sets suppression flag -> __enter__ replaces sys.stderr with StringIO if active -> code runs potentially producing errors -> __exit__ restores sys.stderr -> exception info may be handled by _handle_exit_exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The class appears to serve a straightforward purpose of suppressing stderr. No obfuscation or malicious code appears present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard Python context manager to suppress stderr output. It captures sys.stderr at entry if enabled and restores it upon exit. The exception handling method defaults to re-raising exceptions. No external data sources, untrusted input, or suspicious behavior detected. The code's logic is straightforward and aligned with typical suppression patterns. No signs of malware or malicious intent are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for suppressing stderr output during a context. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data flows, and no obfuscated or harmful logic. The code is safe and intended for benign use.",
