  "purpose": "A context manager to suppress stderr output by redirecting sys.stderr to an io.StringIO() object during its context, then restoring it afterward.",
  "sources": "sys.stderr is replaced with io.StringIO() during __enter__, and restored in __exit__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources; the code manipulates sys.stderr for output suppression.",
  "flows": "On __enter__, sys.stderr is redirected; on __exit__, sys.stderr is restored; exceptions are handled via _handle_exit_exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation; no secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard pattern for suppressing stderr output using a context manager. It captures sys.stderr, replaces it with an in-memory stream if active, and restores it upon exit. Exception handling is customizable but defaults to re-raising exceptions. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The logic is clear and aligns with common practices for such utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for suppressing stderr output. It does not contain malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores for malware and obfuscation are 0, and the security risk is negligible (0). The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
