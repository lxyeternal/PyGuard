{
  "purpose": "Utility function to check if a scalar value is NaN, inspired by scikit-learn's implementation.",
  "sources": "Input parameter `x` passed to `_is_scalar_nan` function.",
  "sinks": "The function itself does not include sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leakage; it merely performs a check on the input.",
  "flows": "Input `x` is evaluated with `isinstance` and `math.isnan` to determine if it is a scalar NaN value.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code is straightforward, standard, and well-documented.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple utility function that checks whether an input is a scalar NaN. It uses `isinstance` to confirm the type is a real number and `math.isnan` to check for NaN. The implementation is standard, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. It is only a basic utility with no network activity, no data leakage, and no malicious behavior. The code follows a common pattern from scikit-learn, indicating it is likely safe and legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function intended for internal checks. There are no signs of malicious intent, supply chain attack, or malware. It performs a straightforward operation with no security risks or suspicious behavior.",
