{
  "purpose": "Utility function to check if a scalar value is NaN, inspired by scikit-learn's implementation.",
  "sources": "Input parameter x; no external data sources or network calls.",
  "sinks": "None; the function only performs an internal check without side effects.",
  "flows": "Input x is checked for being a real number, then math.isnan(x) is applied if so.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation with standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The function verifies if x is a real number and then applies math.isnan to determine if x is NaN. It is a simple, well-documented utility with no external dependencies, side effects, or suspicious patterns. The code is consistent with established practices and contains no obfuscation or malicious code. The logic is correct, and the purpose is solely for data validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility function for scalar NaN detection with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. All evidence indicates it is safe and well-implemented.",
