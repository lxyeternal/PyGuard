  "purpose": "Utility function to check if a value is NaN, based on scikit-learn's implementation.",
  "sources": "Input parameter `x` in the function `_is_scalar_nan`.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data leaks or data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input `x` is checked for type and value to determine if it is NaN.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears straightforward and standard for this purpose. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a utility function that checks whether a given input is a scalar NaN value. It uses `isinstance` to verify if `x` is a real number and then applies `math.isnan(x)` to confirm if it is NaN. The function is a direct reimplementation inspired by scikit-learn, with no external data sources, no network calls, or side effects. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious code segments. The code is simple, standard, and well-commented, with no evidence of malicious intent or malware. It only performs an in-process check without any data exfiltration, system modification, or other malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign utility function for checking NaN values. It contains no malicious behavior, no malware, and poses no security risks.",
