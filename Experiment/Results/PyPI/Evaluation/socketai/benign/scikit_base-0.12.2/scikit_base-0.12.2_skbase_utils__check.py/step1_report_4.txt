  "purpose": "Utility function to check if a scalar value is NaN, intended for internal use in data validation processes.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'x' of the function _is_scalar_nan",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leaks or system effects; no untrusted data flow beyond internal checks",
  "flows": "Input 'x' is checked for being a real number and then passed to math.isnan to determine if it is NaN",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, follows scikit-learn implementation, no suspicious code or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and defines a function that checks if a value is NaN without using np.isnan, which is appropriate for non-numeric types. It avoids unsafe evaluations, hardcoded secrets, or malicious network activity. The code is simple, well-documented, and appears solely for data validation. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility function for checking NaN values, with no malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and intended for internal data validation purposes.",
