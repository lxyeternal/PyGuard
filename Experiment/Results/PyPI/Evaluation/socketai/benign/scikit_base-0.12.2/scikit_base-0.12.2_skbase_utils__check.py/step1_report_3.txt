{
  "purpose": "Utility function to check if a value is NaN, following scikit-learn's implementation.",
  "sources": "Input parameter `x` in the function `_is_scalar_nan`.",
  "sinks": "None; the function does not perform data output or network operations.",
  "flows": "Input `x` is checked for type and then for NaN using `math.isnan(x)` if applicable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and well-documented. It explicitly states it reuses scikit-learn code and has no suspicious or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The function takes an input `x`, verifies if it is a real number (`numbers.Real`), and if so, checks whether it is NaN using `math.isnan`. The logic is consistent with the stated purpose and contains no code injection, network operations, or data leaks. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are present. The code is simple, intended as a utility, and does not perform any side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function for NaN detection, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain risks. It is a clean, straightforward implementation following scikit-learn's pattern.",
