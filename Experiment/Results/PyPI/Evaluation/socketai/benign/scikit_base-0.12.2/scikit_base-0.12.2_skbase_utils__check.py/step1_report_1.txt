{
  "purpose": "Utility function to check if a scalar value is NaN, inspired by scikit-learn's implementation.",
  "sources": "The function reads the input parameter 'x' to determine if it is NaN.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data leading to data leaks or system effects; the code performs a benign check without side effects.",
  "flows": "Input 'x' is checked for being a real number and then evaluated with math.isnan; no external data flows or outputs are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs a standard NaN check using Python's math.isnan with appropriate type checking. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function _is_scalar_nan that determines whether a given input is a scalar NaN value. It uses isinstance to verify if 'x' is a real number, then applies math.isnan to perform the check. The code relies solely on standard Python libraries and contains no network activity, system modifications, or external data processing. Comments and licensing info are standard, with no indication of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function for checking NaN values, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is straightforward, well-documented, and relies only on standard libraries. No malicious intent or security vulnerabilities are present.",
