  "purpose": "Configure and generate documentation for the skbase Python package using Sphinx.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (READTHEDOCS, READTHEDOCS_VERSION), os, sys, skbase module, inspect module",
  "sinks": "URL generation for source code linking, print statements, file path manipulations",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> Conditional logic -> URL construction and file path calculations",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables to determine build context, dynamic URL formation, print statement for non-RTD environment, no hardcoded credentials, no suspicious data leaks, no obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up documentation configurations using standard Sphinx and related extensions. It accesses environment variables to determine build environment, modifies sys.path accordingly, and constructs URLs for source code links using inspect. The linkcode_resolve function attempts to locate source files and generate URLs, but only in the context of documented modules. No user input, data leakage, malicious network activity, or suspicious code execution is observed. Print statements and environment variable checks are benign in context. No obfuscated code or malware-like behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration script for generating documentation with Sphinx. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. Its design focuses on proper documentation setup, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
