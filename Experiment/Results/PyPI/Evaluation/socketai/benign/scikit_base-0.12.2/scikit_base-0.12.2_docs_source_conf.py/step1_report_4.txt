  "purpose": "Configure the documentation build process for the skbase project using Sphinx and related tools.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (READTHEDOCS, READTHEDOCS_VERSION), sys.path modifications, skbase module attributes, os.environ, inspect module, hardcoded URLs and paths.",
  "sinks": "URL construction for source code links, print statements, sys.path insertion, environment variables, external links (GitHub, Binder, etc.), dynamic code resolution via inspect and URL formatting.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence URL formation and version matching -> sys.path insertion and module attribute access -> inspect module used to resolve source locations -> URL strings constructed for source code and documentation hosting.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables to determine runtime behavior; URL and version string manipulation based on environment; use of inspect for source resolution; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious external calls or data leaks; print statements are benign here.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles documentation configuration, including environment-dependent URL and path settings, and uses standard Python modules like os, sys, datetime, and inspect. No code injection, network communication, or data leakage routines are present. The dynamic URL resolution relies on inspecting local modules and files, which is typical for documentation link generation. No suspicious or malicious code behavior such as backdoors, data theft, or remote control is detected. Use of environment variables for version detection and conditional path insertion is standard practice for build scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign Sphinx configuration script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appropriately uses environment variables and inspection modules for documentation purposes, with no suspicious or malicious behaviors observed.",
