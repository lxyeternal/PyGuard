  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard configuration for documentation purposes. It uses common techniques without any malicious or suspicious behavior. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score (~0.1) reflects the environment-dependent URL generation, which is typical and safe in this context."
