{
  "purpose": "Provide utilities for working with nested sequences, including flattening, unflattening, and checking if sequences are flat.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it defines functions that operate on input parameters passed during function calls.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations are present; the functions process and return data without external side effects.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted input; functions process data internally without external data or side-effects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code uses standard Python collections and type checking without malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for nested sequence manipulation, including flattening and unflattening structures. It uses standard Python collections and recursion, with no evidence of external data input or malicious intent. There are no dangerous operations, system calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and appears safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe utility module for nested sequence operations with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
