  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling nested sequences: flattening, unflattening, checking if flat, and removing singletons.",
  "sources": "Input data structures passed to functions (e.g., sequences, nested lists/tuples).",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; functions operate on data in memory without external data handling.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through recursive functions to produce flattened or unflattened structures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, well-documented, and uses standard Python libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code provides safe, standard utility functions for nested sequence manipulation. No external system calls, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. Functions handle data purely in memory, with type checks to prevent errors. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious logic are detected. The code is benign, with no hardcoded secrets or backdoors. All reports correctly identify the code as safe, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The logic is sound, and the functions are typical utility implementations. No evidence suggests malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility module for nested sequence processing. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
