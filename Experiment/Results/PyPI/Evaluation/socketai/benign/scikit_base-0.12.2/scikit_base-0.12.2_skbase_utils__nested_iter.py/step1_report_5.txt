{
  "purpose": "Provide utilities for working with nested sequences, including flattening, unflattening, and checking if structures are flat.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; all data are passed as function parameters.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; functions return processed data without external effects.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed through recursive flattening and unflattening functions without external data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors observed. The code uses standard Python library functions and types, with no obfuscated code or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for nested sequence manipulation, including flatten, unflatten, unflat_len, is_flat, and a helper _remove_single. These functions rely solely on standard Python collections and recursion for processing nested iterables. There are no data leaks, network connections, or system modifications present. No signs of malware, malicious data handling, or obfuscated code are evident. The functions perform typical sequence operations with proper type checks and recursion, with no hidden behaviors or external interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a benign utility module for nested sequence operations with no malicious intent or security risks. It uses standard Python features appropriately and does not exhibit suspicious behavior or malware indicators.",
