{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for handling nested sequences, including flattening, unflattening, and checking if a sequence is flat.",
  "sources": "Functions receive input data such as nested sequences (`obj`, `template`, etc.), and in `_remove_single`, a sequence `x`.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted data into security-sensitive operations or external systems.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sequences through functions like `flatten`, `unflatten`, and `_remove_single`, but all operate purely on data structures without external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code relies solely on standard library modules and type checks.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions for nested sequence manipulation. All functions operate on provided data structures, with recursive flattening and unflattening. There are no indications of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious logic. The code does not handle external inputs insecurely, nor does it perform any unsafe operations like executing dynamic code or network communication. It is well-structured, uses standard library features, and is consistent with common sequence handling patterns. No anomalies or malicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard set of nested sequence utility functions with no malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
