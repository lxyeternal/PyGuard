  "purpose": "Utility functions for working with nested sequences, including flattening, unflattening, and structure checks.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function parameters such as 'obj' and 'template'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform security-sensitive actions are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into internal functions and recursive calls, but no external or untrusted sources or sinks are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are detected. The code uses standard library functions and straightforward recursion. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, no network access, and no data exfiltration or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises utility functions for flattening and unflattening nested sequences, along with structure checks. All functions operate purely on provided input parameters without external dependencies, network activity, or sensitive data handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or security risks. The logic is standard and well-documented, with no anomalies suggesting tampering or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module for nested sequence manipulation with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs safe, common operations using standard Python features.",
