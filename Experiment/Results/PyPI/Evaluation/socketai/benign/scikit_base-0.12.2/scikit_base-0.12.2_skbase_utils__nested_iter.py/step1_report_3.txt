  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling nested sequences, including flattening, unflattening, and checking sequence structure.",
  "sources": "Function parameters such as 'obj' and 'template' which accept user-provided data, input sequences, and objects.",
  "sinks": "Return statements and list comprehensions that output processed data; no external or untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through recursive functions that process nested sequences; no data is sent over the network or written to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code patterns, or unusual behaviors are observed. The functions perform standard sequence processing.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for nested sequence operations: _remove_single, flatten, unflatten, unflat_len, and is_flat. All functions operate solely on input data, using recursive and iterative processing. No external system calls, network access, or potentially malicious code is present. The code appears to be standard sequence manipulation logic without obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of sequence utility functions with no signs of malicious intent or malicious code. It is straightforward and intended for sequence processing without external side effects.",
