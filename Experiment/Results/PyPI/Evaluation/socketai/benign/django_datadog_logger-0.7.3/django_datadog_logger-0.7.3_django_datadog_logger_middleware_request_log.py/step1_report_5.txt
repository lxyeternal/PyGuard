  "purpose": "Middleware for logging HTTP request and response details, including status codes, response times, and error information.",
  "sources": "Reads request object (request.request_start_time), response object (response.status_code, response.reason_phrase, response.data, response.response_start_time).",
  "sinks": "Logs data via logger.warning, logger.error, and logger.info with extra=log_entry_dict.",
  "flows": "Request object -> log_response() reads request.request_start_time; Response object -> log_response() reads status, reason, data, start_time; all data passed to logger.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious data handling. Uses standard logging practices. Response time calculation uses response.response_start_time with fallback to time.time(), which is standard. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution found.",
  "analysis": "The code implements request/response logging middleware for a Django-like framework. It captures response status codes, computes response duration if start time is available, and logs warnings, errors, or info based on status code. The use of logger with extra dicts for structured logging is standard. No evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code appears to perform normal logging functions without side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as intended for logging request-response lifecycle data with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It is standard middleware code for logging purposes, with no suspicious or harmful elements detected.",
