  "purpose": "Middleware for logging HTTP request and response details in a Django REST Framework application.",
  "sources": "Request object (request_start_time attribute), Response object (status_code, reason_phrase, data, response_start_time).",
  "sinks": "Logging calls with extra data (logger.warning, logger.error, logger.info).",
  "flows": "Request data (request_start_time) -> log_response method -> log entries via logger calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation observed. Logging includes response data which could potentially leak sensitive info if response.data contains such data, but this is standard for logging response contents.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a logging middleware that records HTTP status, response time, and error details. It accesses request.request_start_time and response.response_start_time attributes if available, indicating timing measurement. The logs include response data if present, which could potentially leak sensitive data but is typical for debugging. No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code found. No external network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior observed. The overall structure is standard for logging middleware in Django REST Framework applications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging middleware for request/response monitoring with no indications of malicious intent. It records HTTP status and timing info, and logs errors appropriately. No malicious or security-compromising behavior detected.",
