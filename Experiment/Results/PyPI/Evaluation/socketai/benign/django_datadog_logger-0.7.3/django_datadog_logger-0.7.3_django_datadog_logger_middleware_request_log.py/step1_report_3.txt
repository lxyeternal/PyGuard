  "purpose": "Middleware for logging HTTP responses and request durations in a Django REST Framework application.",
  "sources": "Reads request object for start time; reads response object for status code, reason phrase, and data; logs information using logger.",
  "sinks": "Logging calls that could potentially expose sensitive data via logs.",
  "flows": "Request start time -> log_response method -> log entries based on response status code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The code primarily handles logging, with no external data exfiltration or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a middleware class for logging HTTP response details, including response time and status-based logging levels. It reads request start time and response data for logging purposes. No untrusted data sources or malicious sinks are present. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are used. The only potential concern is logging of response data in error cases, which could expose sensitive information if not properly sanitized, but this is standard logging behavior, not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard logging operations for HTTP responses without any signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It primarily logs response status, duration, and error details, which is typical for debugging or monitoring. There are no malicious or security-compromising actions detected.",
