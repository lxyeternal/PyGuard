  "purpose": "Middleware for logging exceptions in a Django web application.",
  "sources": "The exception object passed to process_exception method.",
  "sinks": "Logging exception details with logger.exception, which outputs to logs.",
  "flows": "Exception occurs during request processing -> process_exception logs the exception.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a middleware class that intercepts exceptions during request processing. It logs exceptions that are not of common safe types, but only skips known exceptions like PermissionDenied, Http404, etc. No untrusted input is directly processed, and no malicious actions or data leaks are evident. The logger is used appropriately for exception logging, which is standard practice. There are no indications of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code injections. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a standard exception logging middleware with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any malicious actions or contain malicious payloads.",
