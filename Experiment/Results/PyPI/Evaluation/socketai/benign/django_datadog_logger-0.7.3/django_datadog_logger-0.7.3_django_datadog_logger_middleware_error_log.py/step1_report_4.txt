  "purpose": "Middleware for error logging in Django applications, capturing and logging exceptions during request processing.",
  "sources": "Exception handling in process_exception method; logs any exceptions not in specified list.",
  "sinks": "logger.exception() outputs exception details to logs; no other data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Exceptions caught in process_exception flow from exception occurrence to logger.exception call; no other data flow involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code uses standard Django middleware pattern, and only logs exceptions without executing external commands or handling sensitive data.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a middleware class for Django that logs exceptions not in a specified safe list. It defines __init__, __call__, process_exception, and process_response methods. process_exception logs exceptions if they are not of specific safe types, otherwise, it suppresses them. No external inputs or outputs other than logging are present. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious actions. The use of logger.exception() is standard for error reporting. Overall, the code appears to be a benign error-logging middleware with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard error-logging middleware for Django with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It safely logs unhandled exceptions, improving observability without introducing security issues.",
