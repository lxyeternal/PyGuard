  "purpose": "Middleware for logging exceptions during request processing, excluding specific safe exception types.",
  "sources": "Exception objects passed to process_exception method.",
  "sinks": "logger.exception call that logs exception details.",
  "flows": "Exception raised during request handling → process_exception method → logger.exception logs the exception.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard exception handling and logging.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django middleware class that captures exceptions during request processing. It ignores known safe exceptions (PermissionDenied, Http404, etc.) and logs other exceptions using logger.exception. No data exfiltration, external network calls, or malicious code are present. The code is clear, readable, and follows Django best practices. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are detected. The exception logging could potentially expose sensitive info if logs are insecure, but the code itself is benign. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is zero, indicating no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Django exception logging middleware with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. No modifications are necessary.",
