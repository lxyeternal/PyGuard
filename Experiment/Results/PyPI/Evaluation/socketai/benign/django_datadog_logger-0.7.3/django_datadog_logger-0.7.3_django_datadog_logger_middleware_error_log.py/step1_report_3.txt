  "purpose": "Middleware for logging unhandled exceptions in a Django web application",
  "sources": "Exception handling in process_exception method",
  "sinks": "Logging of exceptions using logger.exception",
  "flows": "Exceptions caught in process_exception flow into logger.exception for logging",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs standard exception logging for specified Django exceptions",
  "analysis": "The code defines a middleware class for Django that logs exceptions other than common HTTP and Django-specific exceptions. It has a straightforward structure, initializes with optional get_response, handles requests by calling get_response, and logs unexpected exceptions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling. The logging is limited to exception details and does not involve data exfiltration or harmful operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be standard Django middleware intended for exception logging without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not include any suspicious or malicious behaviors, backdoors, or data theft mechanisms.",
