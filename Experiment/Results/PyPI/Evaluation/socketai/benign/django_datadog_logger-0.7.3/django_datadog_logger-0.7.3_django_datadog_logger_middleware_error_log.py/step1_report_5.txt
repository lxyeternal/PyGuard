  "purpose": "Middleware for logging exceptions in Django web applications",
  "sources": "Exception handling in process_exception method, which logs exceptions",
  "sinks": "Logging exceptions using logger.exception, which writes to logs",
  "flows": "Exceptions caught in process_exception are logged; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; standard Django middleware pattern used",
  "analysis": "The code defines middleware for logging exceptions, selectively ignoring specific exception types. It utilizes Django's logging framework without any code injection, external data retrieval, or malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscated code is present. The logic is straightforward and aligns with standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard Django middleware for exception logging with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
