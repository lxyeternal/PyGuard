  "purpose": "Middleware for generating and handling request IDs in a Django application, with integration for DataDog logging.",
  "sources": "Reading request metadata (HTTP_X_REQUEST_ID) from incoming requests.",
  "sinks": "Setting response headers ('X-Request-ID') and assigning request object to thread-local storage.",
  "flows": "Input request metadata -> validation and potential generation of UUID -> attaching request ID to request object -> response header modification.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic detected. Use of regex for validation is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code generates or retrieves a request ID from incoming requests, using UUIDs for new IDs and validating existing ones with a regex. It stores request data in thread-local storage and modifies responses to include the request ID. The use of standard libraries and Django middleware patterns suggests no malicious intent. No external network communication, credential handling, or suspicious logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as middleware for request tracking, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard implementation for request ID management.",
