  "purpose": "Generate and manage request IDs for incoming HTTP requests in a Django application, including setting response headers.",
  "sources": "Reading HTTP request headers (HTTP_X_REQUEST_ID), generating UUIDs, accessing request metadata, accessing local storage from django_datadog_logger.wsgi",
  "sinks": "Assigning request ID to request object, setting response header 'X-Request-ID'",
  "flows": "Reading request header -> validating and possibly generating new UUID -> attaching request ID to request object -> setting response header",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. Use of standard libraries, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious external connections.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical middleware implementation for request ID handling. It reads an optional request ID from incoming headers, validates it with a regex, and generates a new UUID if validation fails. It then attaches the request ID to the request object and the response header. The local variable from django_datadog_logger.wsgi is used to temporarily store request data, then cleaned up after response. No external network calls, data leakage, or malicious behavior are present. The regex used for validation is standard and safe. No obfuscation or suspicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward middleware for request ID management with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
