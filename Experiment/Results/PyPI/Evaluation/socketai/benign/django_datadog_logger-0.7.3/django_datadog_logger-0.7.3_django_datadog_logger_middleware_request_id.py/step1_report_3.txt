  "purpose": "Generate and manage unique request IDs for incoming HTTP requests in a Django application, attaching them to responses and logging context.",
  "sources": "request.META.get('HTTP_X_REQUEST_ID') for retrieving incoming request ID; uuid.uuid4() for generating new UUIDs.",
  "sinks": "response['X-Request-ID']' for setting the request ID in HTTP response headers.",
  "flows": "Request header 'HTTP_X_REQUEST_ID' (source) -> validation with regex -> reused or generated UUID (sink); UUID assigned to request object -> response header set with request ID.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code. The regex matches typical base64 characters but does not appear malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code reads an optional request ID from incoming headers, validates it with a regex, and either reuses it or generates a new UUID. It assigns the request ID to the request object and includes it in the response headers. The use of uuid4() for generating IDs is standard. No external data leaks, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident. The code operates within expected parameters for request ID management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for request ID handling in Django middleware. It does not contain malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The overall security risk is low.",
