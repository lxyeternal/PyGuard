  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for managing and retrieving Celery request context in an asynchronous environment.",
  "sources": "Reads request object from thread-local storage (`local.request`) and from function arguments (`args[0].request`).",
  "sinks": "Returns request data, modifies thread-local storage, and interacts with Celery task objects.",
  "flows": "Request object is stored in thread-local via `local.request` when `store_celery_request` is used; retrieved by `get_celery_request`; task name extracted via `get_task_name`.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious backdoors, or malicious code. Use of thread-local storage is typical for context management. No dynamic code execution or data leaks detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for handling Celery task request objects, primarily storing and retrieving request context using thread-local storage. It includes a decorator to capture request objects from methods and temporarily store them. No external data inputs, no suspicious behavior, and no obfuscated or malicious constructs are present. The code's structure is straightforward, with proper exception handling and cleanup of thread-local data. It focuses solely on context management without external network or file operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate utility for managing Celery request context, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured and uses standard practices for thread-local storage management.",
