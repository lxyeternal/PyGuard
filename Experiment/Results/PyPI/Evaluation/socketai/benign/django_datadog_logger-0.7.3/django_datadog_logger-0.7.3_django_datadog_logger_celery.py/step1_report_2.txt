{
  "purpose": "Manage and retrieve Celery request context in an asynchronous environment using thread-local storage.",
  "sources": "Access to local.request via get_celery_request() and store_celery_request() decorators.",
  "sinks": "Potentially modifies or deletes local.request within the thread-local storage, but does not directly handle untrusted data or perform external communication.",
  "flows": "store_celery_request() wraps a function, possibly storing a request object from arguments into thread-local storage, then deletes it after execution. get_celery_request() retrieves this stored request.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or malicious constructs. The code relies on thread-local storage to manage request context, which is standard practice in asynchronous frameworks.",
  "analysis": "The code uses thread-local storage to manage request objects in a Celery context, wrapping functions to store and clear request data. It checks the type and module of request objects before storing them. No external data input, external communication, or suspicious logic present. The purpose appears to be context management without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard context management utility for Celery tasks, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It handles request objects safely within the context of asynchronous execution.",
