  "purpose": "This code manages and stores Celery task request context using thread-local storage for later retrieval.",
  "sources": "The code reads request data from method arguments and thread-local storage variable 'local.request'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; the code only stores and retrieves request objects in thread-local storage, with no direct data leaks or external communication.",
  "flows": "Request object is retrieved from method arguments and stored in thread-local storage; it is later retrieved via get_celery_request or temporarily stored in local.request.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a thread-local storage for storing Celery request objects. The get_celery_request function safely retrieves stored requests. The store_celery_request decorator wraps functions to store the request object if it matches certain criteria. The logic is straightforward, primarily handling context management. No data leakage, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior is present. The code appears to be for context handling within Celery tasks, with no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard context management utility for Celery tasks. It does not contain malware, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It functions solely to manage request context safely within task execution.",
