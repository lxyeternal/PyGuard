  "sources": "local.request, args[0].request, request.task, request.task.name",
  "sinks": "Returning request object, accessing request.task and request.task.name",
  "flows": "get_celery_request() retrieves local.request; store_celery_request() stores request in local.request from function arguments; get_task_name() accesses request.task and request.task.name",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code behavior. Use of local storage appears standard for context management.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for storing and retrieving Celery request context using thread-local storage. It uses the 'asgiref.local.Local' class to store request objects temporarily during function execution. The functions include safeguards like exception handling and attribute checks to prevent errors. The store_celery_request decorator wraps functions to set and clear the request context appropriately. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. The code appears to implement standard request context handling for Celery tasks.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements standard context management for Celery tasks with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It operates as a utility module without external data leaks or harmful actions.",
