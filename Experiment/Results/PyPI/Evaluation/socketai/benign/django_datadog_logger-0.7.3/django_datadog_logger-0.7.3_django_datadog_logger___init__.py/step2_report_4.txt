  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports confirm that the code is simply assigning a version string to the `__version__` variable. There are no input sources, external calls, data processing, or suspicious code segments. The code is minimal and standard for version declaration.  \n**Conclusion:** No issues or malicious code are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify the code as benign, with no anomalies or suspicious behaviors. No logical flaws are evident in the summaries.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**  \n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign a score of 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.  \n- **Malware:** All reports assign a score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.  \n- **Security Risk:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable.  \n- **Confidence:** All are at 1, indicating high certainty in their assessments.\n\nNo adjustments seem necessary here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nSince all assessments agree that the code is benign, assigning higher risk scores would be unjustified. The code does not perform any malicious actions, data leaks, or external communications.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \nThe malware score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the code's nature. No malicious activity is observed or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nAll reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nScores are consistent with the code's content and the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Overall:** The reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a standard version declaration with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### My Expert Estimate:\n\nGiven the code's simplicity and the thoroughness of the reports, I concur with their assessments. However, considering the minimal nature of the code, I would assign:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current evaluations and confirms that the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are correct. The code is a benign version string assignment with no malicious or suspicious features. No changes to scores are necessary.",
