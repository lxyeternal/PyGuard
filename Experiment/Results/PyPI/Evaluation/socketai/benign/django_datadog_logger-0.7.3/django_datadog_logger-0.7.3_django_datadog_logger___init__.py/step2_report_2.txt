  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to ensure consistency and correctness.\n\n1. **Presence of the issues in the code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code only assigns a version string to `__version__`.\n   - No data input, external calls, or complex logic are present.\n   - The code is benign and standard for version declaration.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly interpret the code as harmless.\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident in the summaries.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware` = 0, `obfuscated` = 0, and `securityRisk` = 0.\n   - Given the simplicity and benign nature, these scores are appropriate.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, reflecting certainty, which is reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - No report assigns a risk score higher than 0, which is correct.\n   - The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity justify this.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - All reports assign `malware` = 0, which is correct.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as a standard version string assignment.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and with the code's nature.\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**\n- The code is a straightforward version declaration.\n- All reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No modifications needed in the scores or conclusions.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final note:** The uniformity and correctness of the reports reinforce that this is a benign, standard practice in Python packaging, with no security concerns.",
