  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of the code in the original snippet:**  \n   The original code is:\n   ```python\n   __version__ = \"0.7.3\"\n   ```\n   All reports confirm that the code only assigns a static string to `__version__`, which is a very common practice in Python packages for version declaration.\n\n2. **Assessment of malicious or suspicious activity:**  \n   - No reports identify any input sources, data processing, external calls, or data flows.\n   - All reports explicitly state that the code is minimal, standard, and benign.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n   - Malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, aligning with the benign nature.\n\n3. **Errors or logical flaws in the reports:**  \n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. They correctly identify that the code is a straightforward version assignment with no malicious behavior.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - The reasoning that this code is benign is sound.\n\n4. **Scores evaluation:**  \n   - All reports assign a security risk of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The malware score of 0 is justified given the code's simplicity.\n   - Obfuscated score is 0, which is correct.\n   - Confidence levels are high (1.0 or 1), reflecting certainty.\n\n5. **Potential for other vulnerabilities:**  \n   - Since the code is just a version string assignment, there is no basis for claiming vulnerabilities.\n   - No assumptions are made about hidden malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Overall conclusion:**  \n   - The code is a standard, harmless version declaration.\n   - No modifications to scores are necessary based on the evidence.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is straightforward and clear)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If I were to assign my own estimates, I would concur with the reports:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis is a simple, standard version string declaration with no security concerns.",
