  "purpose": "Defines the version string of the package or module",
  "sources": "No data input sources present",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flow paths identified",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; simply assigns a version string, no anomalies observed",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns a version number to a variable, which is a common practice for package versioning. There are no input sources, no data processing, and no suspicious behavior or code patterns. The simplicity indicates it's likely a fragment of a larger package initialization script. No malicious or suspicious code is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is benign, serving as a version identifier with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
