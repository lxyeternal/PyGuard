  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - There are no data inputs, external calls, or complex logic.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are detected.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code is benign and standard for version declaration.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as a straightforward version string assignment.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - No missing considerations are apparent given the simplicity of the code.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware` = 0\n     - `obfuscated` = 0\n     - `securityRisk` = 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n   - The `confidence` scores are all 1, which is justified.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is just a version string assignment, a high risk score isn't justified.\n   - All reports correctly assign a `securityRisk` of 0.\n   - **Conclusion:** No higher risk scores are warranted.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n   - The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n   - No hidden or obfuscated malicious code is present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities are present or necessary.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable scores are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Based on the analysis:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Security Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a minimal, standard version declaration with no input/output, no suspicious behavior, and no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. No changes are necessary. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed review and the code's simplicity.",
