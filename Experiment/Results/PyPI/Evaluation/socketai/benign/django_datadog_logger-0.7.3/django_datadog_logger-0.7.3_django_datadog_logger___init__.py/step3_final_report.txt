{
  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to the __version__ variable, serving as a package version indicator.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input, data, or environment variables.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as the code only assigns a static string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single assignment statement setting __version__ to '0.7.3'. No input sources, external calls, or data processing occur. The code is a standard practice in Python packages for version declaration. No suspicious behavior, malicious code, or obfuscation is detected. The simplicity and clarity of the code confirm its benign nature. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, with high confidence, reflecting the benign and standard nature of this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version string assignment with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate, and no modifications to scores are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
