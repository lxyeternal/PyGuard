  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their assessments with the code and considering the scoring rationale.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Imports `Local` from `asgiref.local`.\n- Creates an instance `local`.\n- Defines `get_wsgi_request()` which attempts to return `local.request`, or `None` if not set.\n- No external data sinks, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious code detected.\n- Purpose: utility for request context management in ASGI/WSGI environments.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the issues are present:\n- The code is straightforward; all reports correctly identify the core logic: thread-local storage of request data, safe access pattern, no malicious behavior.\n- No issues or anomalies are present in the code itself.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in the reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n- They correctly identify that the code is standard, uses `asgiref` library, and has no malicious intent.\n- No flaws or logical errors are evident in the reports.\n\n### Scores assigned:\n- All reports assign malware score = 0, obfuscated = 0, and security risk very low (mostly 0 or 0.1).\n- These scores are reasonable given the code's benign nature.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1.0 or 0.9), appropriate for such straightforward code.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.1.\n- The code's purpose is request context management, with no evident vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n- Therefore, risk scores should remain low, around 0.0 to 0.1, which they are.\n\n### Malware scores:\n- All reports correctly assign malware = 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- No report makes unwarranted assumptions; all recognize the code as standard utility.\n- No suspicious patterns or hidden malicious intent.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores align well with the analysis.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal risk, primarily due to potential misuse of request data, but no actual harm or vulnerability present.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThe code is a typical utility module with no security issues. The reports are accurate, and their scoring reflects the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate and should remain as they are, with perhaps a very slight increase in risk score (to 0.1) for cautiousness, but even 0.0 is acceptable given the context.",
