  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Imports `Local` from `asgiref.local`.\n- Creates an instance `local`.\n- Defines `get_wsgi_request()` which attempts to return `local.request`, or `None` if not set.\n- No other logic, no external data sinks, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Standard thread-local storage for request data.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies that the code uses `asgiref.local.Local` for request context, with a try-except for safe access.\n- **Malware score:** 0, which aligns with no malicious behavior.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 seems slightly high given the code's simplicity; perhaps a conservative estimate, but justifiable as it exposes request data via `get_wsgi_request()`.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n### 2. **Report 2**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizes standard pattern, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n### 3. **Report 3**\n- Similar findings, emphasizes standard usage, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n### 4. **Report 4**\n- Same conclusion: standard pattern, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n### 5. **Report 5**\n- Same assessment, no anomalies.\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Presence of issues:** No, all reports agree the code is straightforward, standard, and benign.\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning:** None detected. The reports correctly identify the code's purpose and behavior.\n- **Scores:** The malware scores are all zero, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Risk scores:** The only slight concern is the `securityRisk` in Report 1 being 0.1, but since the function exposes request data, some minimal risk exists if misused, so it's acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendation:**\n\n**Malware score:** 0 across all reports is correct.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n\n**Risk score:** Given the exposure of request data via `get_wsgi_request()`, a risk score of around 0.1 to 0.2 is reasonable. Since the reports have it at 0.0 or 0.1, I agree with these low values.\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate and consistent.**\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal risk due to exposing request data, but standard practice in web frameworks)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign utility module for request context management, with no security issues or malicious intent.",
