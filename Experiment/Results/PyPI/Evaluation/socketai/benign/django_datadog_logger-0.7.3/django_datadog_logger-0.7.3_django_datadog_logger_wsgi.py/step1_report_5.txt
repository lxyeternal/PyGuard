{
  "purpose": "Provides a thread-local storage for the current request object in an ASGI environment, enabling access to request data across different parts of an application.",
  "sources": "The 'local.request' attribute accessed in get_wsgi_request() via the 'local' object, which is an instance of asgiref.local.Local.",
  "sinks": "The return of local.request in get_wsgi_request(), which could potentially expose request data if misused, but in this context, it is a safe accessor.",
  "flows": "Code initializes 'local', then get_wsgi_request() attempts to retrieve 'local.request', handling AttributeError if not set.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. Use of asgiref.local.Local is standard for thread or context-local storage.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Local from asgiref.local and creates an instance. The function get_wsgi_request() safely accesses local.request, returning None if not set. No data leakage, external network activity, or malicious behavior is evident. The code is minimal, straightforward, and uses standard library components for managing request context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for request context handling in an ASGI environment. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It simply provides a safe accessor for the current request object.",
