{
  "purpose": "Provides thread-local storage for WSGI request objects in an asynchronous environment.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'local.request' attribute within the get_wsgi_request() function.",
  "sinks": "Returns 'local.request' or None; no data leaks or external sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Code accesses 'local.request' as a source, with no external data flows or processing beyond attribute access.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs observed. Uses standard thread-local pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a thread-local storage class 'Local' from a known library 'asgiref.local'. It creates an instance 'local'. The function get_wsgi_request() attempts to access the 'request' attribute on 'local' and returns it if present; otherwise, returns None. The use of try-except for AttributeError is standard. No untrusted input sources, no external network calls, no data leaks, no suspicious code logic. The code appears to be a simple utility for request context storage in an async server environment. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code provides a standard thread-local request storage utility without any malicious intent. It is safe and typical for asynchronous WSGI applications.",
