{
  "purpose": "Provide thread-local storage for WSGI request objects in asynchronous environments.",
  "sources": "The code reads from 'local.request' in the 'get_wsgi_request' function.",
  "sinks": "Access to 'local.request' may potentially expose stored request data if misused, but no direct data leakage or external transmission occurs here.",
  "flows": "The code attempts to retrieve data from thread-local storage ('local.request') when 'get_wsgi_request' is called.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. Usage of 'asgiref.local.Local' is standard for request context management. No obfuscation or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a thread-local storage class and creates an instance 'local'. The function 'get_wsgi_request' safely attempts to access 'local.request', returning None if not set. This pattern is common in web frameworks for request context management. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or malicious code. The code is minimal and appears to serve a legitimate purpose without any anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for managing request context in asynchronous web applications. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content.",
