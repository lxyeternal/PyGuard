{
  "purpose": "Provides a thread-local storage object for managing request data in ASGI applications, with a helper function to retrieve the current request.",
  "sources": "The import of Local from asgiref.local; access to local.request in get_wsgi_request()",
  "sinks": "local.request in get_wsgi_request(), which could potentially expose request data if misused",
  "flows": "The local object stores request data during request handling; get_wsgi_request retrieves this data when called",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or unusual code patterns. The code uses standard thread-local storage for request context.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Local from asgiref.local, a common utility in ASGI frameworks for request context management. It creates a Local instance 'local' and defines a function get_wsgi_request() that returns the current request stored in 'local.request' or None if not set. The code includes an __all__ list for module exports. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code appears to be a straightforward utility for request management in a web application, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for managing request context in ASGI applications. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It simply provides access to request data stored in thread-local storage, with no suspicious or malicious code present.",
