{
  "purpose": "Utility module for managing request context using thread-local storage in ASGI/WSGI applications.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'local' object, specifically accessing 'local.request'.",
  "sinks": "The 'get_wsgi_request' function returns 'local.request', which could be used elsewhere in the application to access request data.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from the request handling process into 'local.request' (set elsewhere), and is retrieved via 'get_wsgi_request()'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with standard usage of 'asgiref.local.Local'.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'Local' from 'asgiref.local', creates an instance 'local', and defines a function 'get_wsgi_request()' that safely returns 'local.request' or None if not set. It employs standard thread-local storage for request context management, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. The code is minimal and well-structured, serving a common purpose in asynchronous web frameworks. No suspicious activity, backdoors, or vulnerabilities are present. The use of try-except ensures safe access without exposing sensitive data or risking code injection. Overall, the code is benign, with a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1) due to its utility nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign utility for request context management in Python web applications. It poses minimal security risk and contains no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The provided reports are accurate and consistent with the code's purpose and structure.",
