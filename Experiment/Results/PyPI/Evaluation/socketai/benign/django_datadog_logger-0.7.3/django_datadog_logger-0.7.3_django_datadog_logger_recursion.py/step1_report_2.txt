{
  "purpose": "The code defines a decorator to detect and prevent recursive calls of a function by inspecting the call stack.",
  "sources": "inspect.stack() is used to examine the current call stack to detect recursion.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the code only raises an exception if recursion is detected.",
  "flows": "When the decorated function is called, the wrapper inspects the call stack and potentially raises an exception if recursion is found.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code performs a legitimate function of recursion detection.",
  "analysis": "The code employs inspect.stack() within a wrapper function to analyze the call stack whenever the decorated function is invoked. It checks if the function's name appears in any frame in the call stack, raising a RecursionDetected exception if recursion is detected. The use of inspect.stack() for recursion detection is legitimate and not inherently malicious. No external data inputs, network operations, or security-sensitive actions are present. The code structure is straightforward and serves a debugging or enforcement purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for detecting recursive calls. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
