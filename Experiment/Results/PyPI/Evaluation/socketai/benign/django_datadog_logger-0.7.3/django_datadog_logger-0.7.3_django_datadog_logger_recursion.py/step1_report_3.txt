{
  "purpose": "This code provides a decorator to prevent recursive calls to a function by inspecting the call stack and raising an exception if recursion is detected.",
  "sources": "The code reads the function's name (__name__) and inspects the call stack via inspect.stack().",
  "sinks": "The code raises an exception (RecursionDetected) if recursion is found; no external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The decorator checks the call stack for the function's name to detect recursion before executing the function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard Python modules and techniques for recursion detection; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom RuntimeError class for recursion detection. The 'not_recursive' decorator wraps a function to inspect the call stack before invocation. If the function's name appears in the current call stack, a RecursionDetected exception is raised, preventing recursion. This is a straightforward, intended behavior to prevent infinite recursion; it does not involve malicious code or malicious behavior. The code uses standard Python features and libraries with no suspicious modifications or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility to prevent recursive calls, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It functions as an intended safeguard against recursion issues.",
