{
  "purpose": "The code provides a decorator to detect and prevent recursive calls to a function by raising an exception if recursion is detected.",
  "sources": "The code reads the function's name via f.__name__ and the current call stack via inspect.stack().",
  "sinks": "The code does not explicitly write or transmit data; it raises an exception if recursion is detected.",
  "flows": "The decorator inspects the current call stack to find if the function appears more than once, indicating recursion, and raises an exception to prevent it.",
  "anomalies": "The approach to detect recursion by matching function names in the call stack can produce false positives if functions with the same name are called in different contexts or nested functions. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception and a decorator to prevent recursion. It inspects the current call stack with inspect.stack(), comparing function names to detect recursion. This method is somewhat naive, as it relies solely on function names, which could lead to false positives in certain scenarios. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code appears to be a utility for ensuring non-recursive function execution, with no suspicious or malicious activities present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility to detect recursion, with no signs of malicious intent or malware. The only concern is the potential for false positives due to name-based recursion detection, but this does not constitute malicious behavior.",
