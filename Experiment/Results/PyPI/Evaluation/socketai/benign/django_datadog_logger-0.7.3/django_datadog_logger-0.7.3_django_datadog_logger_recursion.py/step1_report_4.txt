{
  "purpose": "The code defines a decorator to detect recursive calls to a function and raises an exception if recursion is detected.",
  "sources": "The decorator inspects the call stack using inspect.stack() to read current stack frames.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "The code inspects the call stack (source) within the wrapper function; if a recursive call is detected (sink), it raises an exception.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns. The code uses standard Python inspection and decorator patterns. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a simple mechanism to detect recursive function calls by inspecting the call stack using inspect.stack(). It raises a custom exception RecursionDetected if recursion is found. The implementation is straightforward and does not include any malicious or suspicious behavior. It does not process external input or perform network operations, nor does it contain any code that appears malicious or sabotage-related.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility to prevent recursion in functions, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears purely as a protective measure without malicious intent.",
