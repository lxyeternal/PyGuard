  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code provides a decorator `not_recursive` that inspects the current call stack via `inspect.stack()`.\n- It compares each frame's function name with the decorated function's name (`f.__name__`).\n- If a match is found, it raises a `RecursionDetected` exception.\n- The approach is straightforward but relies solely on function names, which can produce false positives if functions with the same name are called in different contexts or nested functions.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- The code **correctly** detects recursion based on function name matching.\n- **Potential false positives** can occur if multiple functions share the same name or if nested functions are involved, but this is an inherent limitation of the approach, not a security flaw.\n- No malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks are present.\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Accurate description.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies that the method relies on function names, which can cause false positives.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent; just a utility with a known limitation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 (small, due to false positive potential), confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Correctly rated. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis:** Properly states that `inspect.stack()` is used legitimately.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Correct.\n- **Analysis:** Straightforward detection of recursion, no malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign utility.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis:** Recognizes the simplicity and benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis:** Notes the unconventional but harmless method.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe utility.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 (small, due to inefficiency and false positives), confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly assign 0; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above 0.5 in some reports (e.g., 0.9 or 1) due to the potential for false positives, but **not** because of malicious intent.\n\n**Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**  \nThe only concern is the potential for false positives, which could lead to unexpected behavior in production environments if used improperly. However, this is a correctness/performance concern, not a security vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- The code **does not** contain malware or malicious behavior.\n- The detection method is **not** obfuscated or malicious but can produce false positives.\n- The risk scores assigned are **reasonable** given the potential for false positives but **not** for malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** (low, due to false positive potential, but not security-related)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nAll reports are accurate in their assessment that this code is benign and intended for recursion detection. The main concern is the method's potential for false positives, not malicious activity. The scores assigned are reasonable, and I agree with their conclusions.\n\n**Final note:**  \nWhile the code is safe, if used in production, developers should be aware of its limitations to avoid false positives that could disrupt normal flow.",
