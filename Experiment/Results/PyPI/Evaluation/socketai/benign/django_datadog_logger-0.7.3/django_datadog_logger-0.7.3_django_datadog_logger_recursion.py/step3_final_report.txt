  "purpose": "Detects recursion in functions by inspecting the call stack and raising an exception if the function's name appears in any frame.",
  "sources": "inspect.stack() call to retrieve current call frames",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process external data or perform side effects",
  "flows": "Function name comparison from the decorator to call stack frames; raises exception upon match",
  "anomalies": "Uses function name matching which can produce false positives in nested or similarly named functions; no malicious code present",
  "analysis": "The code implements a decorator that inspects the current call stack to detect recursion by matching the decorated function's name with frame function names. It raises a custom exception if a match is found, indicating recursion. The approach is straightforward but can lead to false positives if multiple functions share the same name or in nested contexts. No external data handling, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. The code is clear, uses standard Python modules, and does not contain obfuscation or malicious intent. The malware score is 0, as there is no malicious activity. The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is straightforward. The security risk score is 0.1, reflecting potential false positives but not a security threat. Confidence in this assessment is high (around 0.9-1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for recursion detection with no signs of malware or malicious behavior. Its method may produce false positives in complex call stacks, but this does not constitute a security risk. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
