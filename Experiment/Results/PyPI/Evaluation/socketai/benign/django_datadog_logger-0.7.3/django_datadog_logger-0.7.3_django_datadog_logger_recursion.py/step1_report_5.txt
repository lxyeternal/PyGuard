{
  "purpose": "Define a decorator to prevent recursive calls of a function by raising an exception if recursion is detected.",
  "sources": "inspect.stack() to examine call frames; f.__name__ to identify the function being decorated.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; the code does not handle untrusted input or output data directly.",
  "flows": "The decorator inspects the call stack for the function name; if found, raises an exception, otherwise proceeds to call the function.",
  "anomalies": "Uses inspect.stack() for recursion detection, which is unusual and potentially inefficient; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a non-recursive decorator by inspecting the call stack to detect if the function has been called recursively. It raises a custom RuntimeError if recursion is found. There is no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior; the approach is somewhat unconventional but not harmful. No external data sources or sinks are involved; no suspicious data flows are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a utility to prevent recursive function calls by inspecting the call stack. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. Its unconventional method for recursion detection is notable but not harmful. Overall, it appears safe.",
