  "purpose": "Custom JSON encoder extending Django's JSON encoder to handle serialization errors by converting them to strings.",
  "sources": "Import from django.core.serializers.json, usage of super() and exception handling within default() method",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processing, no external network or file operations",
  "flows": "No significant data flows involving untrusted sources; primarily a wrapper around existing encoder functionality",
  "anomalies": "The try-except block in default() is unusual but not inherently malicious; it catches TypeError and returns the error message as a string, which could obscure errors but is not malicious by itself",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of DjangoJSONEncoder that overrides the default() method. This method attempts to serialize objects normally, but on encountering a TypeError, it returns the error message as a string instead of raising the exception. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors such as network access, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The try-except pattern is atypical but not harmful in this context; it may obscure serialization issues but does not introduce security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign extension of Django's JSON encoder designed to handle serialization errors gracefully. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
