{
  "purpose": "A subclass of DjangoJSONEncoder that overrides default() to catch TypeError exceptions and return the error message as a string, providing error handling during JSON serialization.",
  "sources": "The default() method reads the object to serialize; no external data sources involved.",
  "sinks": "Returning error messages as strings could potentially obscure underlying data issues but does not lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "The method attempts to serialize an object; if a TypeError occurs, it returns the error message string instead of raising an exception.",
  "anomalies": "The pattern of catching TypeError and returning the error message as a string is somewhat unconventional but not malicious; no external or suspicious code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code extends Django's JSON encoder to handle serialization errors gracefully by catching TypeError exceptions. It does not involve external data sources, network activity, or malicious logic. The exception handling could obscure underlying data issues but does not introduce security vulnerabilities. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. The error handling pattern is standard, and the code's purpose is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard extension of Django's JSON encoder with error handling. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks are present. The minor concern about error message masking does not constitute a security threat.",
