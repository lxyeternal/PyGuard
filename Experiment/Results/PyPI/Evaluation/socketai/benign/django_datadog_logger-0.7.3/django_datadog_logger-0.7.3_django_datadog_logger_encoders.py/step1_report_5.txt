  "purpose": "Define a custom JSON encoder subclass for Django that attempts to serialize objects and falls back to string representation on failure.",
  "sources": "Import from django.core.serializers.json, usage of super() and exception handling",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks or data leakage points are present",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is a class definition with method override, no data flow from sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard pattern for extending Django's JSON encoder with exception handling",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django's JSON encoder and creates a subclass SafeJsonEncoder. The 'default' method attempts to serialize an object using the parent class method, catching a TypeError exception. If such an error occurs, it converts the error to a string. This is a standard pattern to handle unserializable objects gracefully. No external data sources, no data transmission, or suspicious code is present. The code is straightforward and aligns with common practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign extension of Django's JSON encoder with proper exception handling. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security issues.",
