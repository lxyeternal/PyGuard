  "purpose": "Define a custom JSON encoder that extends Django's JSON encoder to handle serialization errors gracefully.",
  "sources": "Importing DjangoJSONEncoder from django.core.serializers.json; usage of super() in default method.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any direct sinks for untrusted data or system effects.",
  "flows": "Input data passed to default() could trigger error handling, but there are no external data flows or untrusted sources within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code straightforwardly extends existing functionality without unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of DjangoJSONEncoder with an overridden default method. This method attempts to serialize an object, and if a TypeError occurs, it returns the error message as a string. This is a common pattern to avoid crashes during serialization. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behavior is present. The code simply provides an error fallback for JSON serialization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard extension of Django's JSON encoder to handle serialization errors gracefully. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
