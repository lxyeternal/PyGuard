{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom JSON encoder subclassing Django's JSONEncoder to handle serialization, with a fallback for TypeError exceptions.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; the code does not read input or data streams.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; no untrusted data handling or external data transmission.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely defines a class with a method override.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code appears straightforward, with standard error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django's JSON encoder, defines a subclass SafeJsonEncoder that overrides the default method, attempting to serialize objects and catching TypeError exceptions to return error messages as strings. There are no hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious logic. It functions as a safe extension for JSON serialization within a Django application, providing fallback error messages.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a standard extension of Django's JSON serialization, with proper error handling. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and functional within its context.",
