{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom JSON encoder subclassing Django's default encoder, with exception handling for serialization errors.",
  "sources": "Imports DjangoJSONEncoder from django.core.serializers.json",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data sinks that process untrusted input directly",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code defines a class with a method that handles serialization with exception fallback",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; simple extension with exception handling",
  "analysis": "The code creates a subclass SafeJsonEncoder that overrides the default method to add exception handling. If serialization fails due to a TypeError, it returns the string of the exception. This pattern is standard for handling serialization issues. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data leakage. The exception handling could mask underlying data issues but does not introduce security risks by itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign extension of Django's JSON encoder, adding error handling for serialization problems without any malicious intent or security concerns.",
