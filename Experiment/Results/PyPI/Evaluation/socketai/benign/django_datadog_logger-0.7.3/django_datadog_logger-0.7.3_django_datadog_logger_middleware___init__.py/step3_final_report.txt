  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalies.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, input/output functions, network requests, file operations",
  "sinks": "Network connections, environment variables, file I/O, data processing functions",
  "flows": "Input sources such as environment variables or files to sinks like network requests or file writes",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious functions",
  "analysis": "The code snippets across reports are benign, involving standard modules, environment variables, file I/O, or network requests. No malicious indicators such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or backdoors are present. Obfuscation is absent, and no suspicious patterns are detected. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. Confidence levels are high due to the straightforward analysis. Overall, the code poses minimal security risks, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets are benign, with no malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. The overall security posture is very low risk.",
