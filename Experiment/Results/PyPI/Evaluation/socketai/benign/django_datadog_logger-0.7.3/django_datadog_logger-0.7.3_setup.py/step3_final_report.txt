  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging a project, reading static documentation and requirements files, and configuring package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md', 'HISTORY.md', and 'requirements.txt' files; no untrusted input processed at runtime.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs; no network, database, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Static file reads during setup; no dynamic or untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward, conventional setup script with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script that reads static documentation and requirements files, filters out comments and URLs, and invokes setuptools.setup() with static metadata. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is present. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is detected. All signals indicate a benign, well-structured package configuration. The security risk and malware scores are correctly assigned as zero, reflecting no security concerns. The minimal security risk in one report (0.1) is an overestimation; the overall risk should be 0. All reports are consistent with this assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores across all reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. No modifications are necessary.",
