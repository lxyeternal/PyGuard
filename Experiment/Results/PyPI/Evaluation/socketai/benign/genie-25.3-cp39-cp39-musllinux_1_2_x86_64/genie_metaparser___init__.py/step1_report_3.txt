{
  "purpose": "Define copyright information and set up a regular expression-based import map for module resolution.",
  "sources": "Reading the __copyright__ string and the import statement, including the re module and local import of _metaparser.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data processing or external output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static import resolution does not involve user input.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic regular expression for import mapping is unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or malicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a copyright string, imports the 're' module, and imports a local module. It then creates a dictionary '_IMPORTMAP' with a regex pattern intended to match module names starting with 'metaparser' for import resolution. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors such as network activity, code execution, or credential handling. The pattern appears to be used for module aliasing or import customization, which is common in package setup or dynamic import schemes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign. It sets up import mapping for module resolution, which is a common pattern and does not indicate malicious intent or security risks.",
