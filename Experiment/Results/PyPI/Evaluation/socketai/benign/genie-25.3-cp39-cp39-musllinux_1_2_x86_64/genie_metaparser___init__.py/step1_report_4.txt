{
  "purpose": "To set up a copyright notice and import statements, and define a mapping for regex-based module resolution.",
  "sources": "The copyright declaration, the import of a local module, and the _IMPORTMAP dictionary with a regex pattern.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks are present; no external data handling or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code primarily sets up static mappings and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated features detected. The regex pattern is straightforward and appears to be for module resolution.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a copyright declaration, a standard import statement, and a dictionary containing a regex pattern mapped to a module name. The regex pattern is designed to match module names starting with 'metaparser', which seems to be part of a module resolution or import system. There are no suspicious behaviors, malicious code, or security risks evident. The code appears to be part of a larger framework or package setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign, primarily setting up metadata and import mappings. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities based on the provided content.",
