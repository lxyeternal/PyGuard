  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues present in code?** No. The code is straightforward setup with no malicious activity.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None identified. The reasoning is sound.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The code is benign, with no suspicious patterns or behaviors.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Similar to Report 1, it's a benign import setup.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0 — reasonable.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Again, a benign pattern for module import resolution.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.1, obfuscated=0 — the risk score is very low, reflecting minimal concern.\n- **Justification:** The only slight concern is the use of regex for import mapping, which is somewhat unusual but not malicious.\n- **Challenge:** The risk score of 0.1 is justified as a very low security concern, perhaps due to the dynamic import pattern.\n- **Conclusion:** Acceptable.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The code is standard setup code.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.1, obfuscated=0 — similar to Report 3, a very low risk.\n- **Justification:** The regex-based import mapping is not inherently malicious but somewhat unusual.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Mostly zero, with a few at 0.1 due to the dynamic regex pattern for import mapping—this is reasonable given the context.\n\n### Final recommendation:\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of the code, I would **not** increase the malware or obfuscated scores. The small risk scores are justified due to the use of regex for import mapping, which could potentially be exploited in more complex scenarios, but in this context, it remains low.\n\n### My estimated scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.05 to 0.1 (keeping it very low, reflecting minimal concern)\n\n**Summary:** All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with minor points of caution regarding the regex-based import mapping, but nothing warranting higher risk scores.",
