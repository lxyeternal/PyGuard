{
  "purpose": "Defines a copyright string, imports the re module and a local parser, and sets up a regex-based import mapping for modules starting with 'metaparser'.",
  "sources": "The re module import, the __copyright__ string, and the _IMPORTMAP dictionary with regex pattern matching module names.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code is purely configuration for import resolution.",
  "flows": "The regex pattern in _IMPORTMAP is used during module import resolution to map module names starting with 'metaparser' to 'genie.metaparser'.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, serving as a configuration snippet for module import aliasing. The regex pattern is static and used for matching module names, which is common in package setup. No data flows from untrusted sources, no network activity, and no obfuscated or malicious code are present. The regex pattern's use is standard and does not indicate malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk near 0) are appropriate. Slightly elevated risk scores (0.1) in some reports are justified by the regex pattern's dynamic nature but do not indicate actual threats. Overall, the code is benign and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import configuration snippet with no malicious or security risks. The minor risk scores are justified by the pattern's dynamic matching but do not pose a real threat. All reports correctly assess the code as safe, and no modifications to scores are necessary.",
