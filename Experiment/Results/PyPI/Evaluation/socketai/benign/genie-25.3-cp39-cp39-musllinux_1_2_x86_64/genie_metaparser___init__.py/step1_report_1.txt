{
  "purpose": "Define a copyright statement and set up a regular expression mapping for import handling within a Python package.",
  "sources": "The copyright declaration string, the import statement, and the regular expression pattern in _IMPORTMAP",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks",
  "flows": "No data flows detected; the code sets up a pattern-mapping dictionary for module imports",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic. The import mapping could be used dynamically but does not itself indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a copyright string, a standard import statement, and a regex-based import map. The regex appears to match module names starting with 'metaparser'. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors such as network activity, data leakage, or backdoors. No obfuscated code or unusual code patterns are present. The code's purpose seems to be organizing or managing module imports with a specific pattern.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as part of a package setup or import configuration. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks present.",
