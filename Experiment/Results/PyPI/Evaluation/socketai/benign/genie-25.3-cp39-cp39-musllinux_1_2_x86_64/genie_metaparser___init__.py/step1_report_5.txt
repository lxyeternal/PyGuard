  "purpose": "Define a copyright statement and set up a regular expression map for module import resolution.",
  "sources": "Reading the copyright string and the import statements, including the regex pattern compilation.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data sinks or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only sets up a regex pattern for module import resolution.",
  "anomalies": "The regex pattern is designed to match module names starting with 'metaparser'. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code activities are present. The use of a regex for import mapping is common and not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code includes a copyright string and imports a module. It defines a dictionary with a compiled regex pattern that matches module names beginning with 'metaparser'. There are no indications of data leaks, malicious code, or obfuscated behavior. The pattern appears to be for controlled import resolution within the package. No external data sources or untrusted inputs are processed. Overall, this is standard setup code for import handling with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, mainly establishing a regex-based import map for internal use. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident.",
