{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated due to missing or minimal comments, but it appears to be a utility script or module with potential for further integration.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, function parameters, and possibly from external modules or files if imported.",
  "sinks": "Data may be sent over network connections if present, or written to files or database queries if included in the larger context.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or function inputs to processing functions, and potentially to network or storage sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are evident. No obfuscated or malicious code constructs identified. The code structure appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code has minimal complexity, primarily importing modules and defining functions or variables. No risky patterns such as dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or insecure practices are present. External libraries used are common and not suspicious. The absence of explicit network activity or sensitive data handling reduces the likelihood of malicious intent. The overall code appears benign and aligns with typical Python utility scripts.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is straightforward and does not contain anomalies or suspicious patterns. It can be considered low risk.",
