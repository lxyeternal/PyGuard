  "purpose": "Define an operational module representing system state with compatibility across OS and management interfaces.",
  "sources": "No input data reading, no external data sources, only module-level comments and metadata.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows as there are no executable statements, input handling, or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only comments and metadata; no executable code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a docstring describing a module and a metadata variable indicating copyright. There are no functions, classes, data processing, input/output operations, or executable code. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present. The absence of code, especially malicious code, reduces the likelihood of malicious intent. The comments serve documentation purposes and do not introduce security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely documentation and metadata with no executable content. It presents no security risks, no malware, and no obfuscation. It appears to be a standard module template for documentation purposes only.",
