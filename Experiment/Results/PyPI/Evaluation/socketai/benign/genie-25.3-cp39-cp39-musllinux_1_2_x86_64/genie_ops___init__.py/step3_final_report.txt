  "purpose": "This code serves as a documentation module describing the operational state component of a larger system, with no executable logic.",
  "sources": "The code contains only comments, metadata, and a copyright statement; no data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to leaks or effects, as the code is purely static documentation.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths exist due to the absence of executable code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is entirely composed of comments and metadata with no suspicious or unusual constructs; no anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is static documentation with no functions, classes, or executable statements. It contains only descriptive comments and metadata, indicating no potential for malicious behavior or security risks. The absence of data handling, input/output, or dynamic code means there are no sources, sinks, or flows that could be exploited. The code's benign nature is confirmed by the lack of suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code segments. All scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately set to zero, with high confidence in this assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is purely informational documentation with no executable or malicious content. It poses no security threat, malware risk, or obfuscation concern. The scores and assessment are consistent with its static, benign nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
