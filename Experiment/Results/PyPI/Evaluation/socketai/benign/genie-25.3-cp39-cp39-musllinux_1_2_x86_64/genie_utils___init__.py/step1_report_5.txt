{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions as part of the Genie framework, specifically importing a module named Dq.",
  "sources": "The code imports a local module '.dq'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing occurs in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a module-level docstring, metadata, and an import statement of a local module. There are no data inputs, outputs, or executable logic that could be exploited or indicate malicious intent. The import statement appears to be a standard relative import of a component called Dq within the same package. No hardcoded secrets, code injection, or malicious behaviors are visible.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign module definition with no malicious or security concerns. It merely imports another module without any suspicious activity.",
