  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Presence and Behavior**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code snippet contains only module-level comments, metadata, and a single import statement from a local module `.dq`. There are no functions, data processing, network activity, or user input handling.\n   - The code is minimal and appears to be a typical part of a larger modular Python project.\n\n2. **Malicious or Suspicious Behavior**:\n   - No report indicates any signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads.\n   - The import statement from `.dq` is standard for modular codebases and does not inherently suggest malicious intent.\n   - Given the absence of executable logic, data flows, or external interactions, there is no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes**:\n   - The code is syntactically correct and logically straightforward.\n   - No errors or flaws are evident in the snippet or the reports.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as zero, which is appropriate.\n   - The confidence scores are high (mostly 1), reflecting the reviewers' certainty that the code is benign.\n   - The analysis and conclusions across reports are consistent and reasonable.\n\n5. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions**:\n   - The reports do not assume any vulnerabilities; they recognize the code's simplicity.\n   - No claims are made about hidden malicious behavior or vulnerabilities based on this snippet.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - Based on the code snippet and the reports, the module is a benign, standard utility module with no security concerns.\n   - The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (correct)\n\n**My personal estimate** aligns with the reports:\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\nThis code snippet appears entirely safe and unremarkable from a security perspective.",
