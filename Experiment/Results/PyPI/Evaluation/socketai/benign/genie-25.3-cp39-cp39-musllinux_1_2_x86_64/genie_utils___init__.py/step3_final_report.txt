{
  "purpose": "This module provides utility functions for the larger Genie project, serving as a helper component.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports a local module '.dq'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the import is static and does not involve runtime data transfer.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only module-level comments, metadata, and a single import statement from a local module. There are no functions, data processing, external communications, or dynamic behaviors. The import of '.dq' is a standard internal dependency. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are evident. The minimal nature and lack of executable logic strongly suggest benign intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security concerns. All reports correctly identify the code as safe, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
