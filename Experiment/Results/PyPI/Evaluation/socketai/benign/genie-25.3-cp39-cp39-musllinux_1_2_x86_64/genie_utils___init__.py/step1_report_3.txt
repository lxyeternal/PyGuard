  "purpose": "Provides utility functions as part of the Genie module, specifically importing Dq from a sub-module.",
  "sources": "Imports Dq from the local dq module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling evident in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow observed; only a module import statement.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any executable code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only module-level docstrings, metadata, and a single import statement. There are no data inputs, no processing, and no output or network activity. The import is from a local module, which is standard for modular Python packages. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payload, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, straightforward module skeleton with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply imports a class or function from a local module, likely for further use elsewhere.",
