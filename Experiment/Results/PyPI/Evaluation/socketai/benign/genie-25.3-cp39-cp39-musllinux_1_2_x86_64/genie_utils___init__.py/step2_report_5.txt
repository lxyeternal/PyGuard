  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the validity of their assessments, the scores assigned, and whether any inconsistencies or overlooked risks exist.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as minimal, containing only metadata, comments, and a single import statement from a local module (.dq).\n- No data flows, external inputs, outputs, or executable logic are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, suspicious constructs, or malicious behavior are identified.\n- The code appears to be a straightforward utility module, part of a larger project, with no immediate security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n**Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n- The code snippet is very simple; it only contains metadata and an import statement.\n- There are no embedded functions, data processing, or dynamic code execution.\n- The import from `.dq` is standard for modular Python code; no indication of malicious intent.\n\n**Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment that the code is benign.\n- They correctly identify the lack of suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious logic.\n- No errors or logical flaws are apparent in the reports.\n\n**Scores Assigned and Their Reasonableness:**\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all reports, justified given the code's clarity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Security risk score:** 0, appropriate given the minimal and benign nature of the code.\n\n**Risk Scores and Justification:**\n- Since there's no executable logic, no external data handling, and no suspicious constructs, a **risk score of 0** is appropriate.\n- The reports' confidence levels are high (mostly 1), aligning with the minimal code and clear assessment.\n\n**Malware, Obfuscated, and Risk Scores Estimation:**\n- Based on the code snippet, I agree with the reports' assessments:\n  - **Malware score:** 0\n  - **Obfuscated score:** 0\n  - **Risk score:** 0\n\n---\n\n### Final conclusion:\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. They correctly identify the code as benign, with no security risks, obfuscation, or malware present.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Presence of issues:** None\n- **Errors in reports:** None\n- **Scores:** All appropriate; no changes needed\n- **Justification for scores:** The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features justify zero scores across malware, obfuscation, and risk.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code snippet.",
