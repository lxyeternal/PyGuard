  "purpose": "Provides utility functions as part of the Genie project, likely for data processing or validation.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module '.dq'. No other data input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling points are evident in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows are identifiable within this code fragment, as it only contains a comment and an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "Code contains only comments, metadata, and a single import statement; no suspicious or unusual code behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, comprising a module-level comment, metadata, and a single import of a local module. There are no data processing, external communication, or dynamic execution elements. The import appears to be standard for modular Python code and does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The code appears to be a benign module setup with a standard import statement.",
