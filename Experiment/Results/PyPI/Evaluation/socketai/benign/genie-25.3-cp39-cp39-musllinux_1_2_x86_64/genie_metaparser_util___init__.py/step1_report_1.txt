  "purpose": "Utility functions for manipulating nested dictionaries, including key validation, renaming, converting, merging, and extracting nested data.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are mainly dictionary parameters passed to functions; no external data sources or network operations are present.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks such as network communications, file operations, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Function calls operate internally on data passed as arguments; no flow to external systems or untrusted sources is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code appears to be standard dictionary manipulation logic with no obfuscation or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a set of functions for handling nested dictionaries: checking for key existence, converting nested key paths, renaming nested keys, creating nested dictionaries from key lists, extracting values, and merging dictionaries. All functions operate purely on provided inputs without any external side effects. No network activity, file I/O, or system calls are present. No indications of malicious intent or sabotage are detected. The implementation is straightforward, using recursion and standard Python features, with no signs of obfuscation or hidden logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of utility functions for nested dictionary management. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or supply chain attacks. It appears safe and intended for data manipulation purposes only.",
