  "purpose": "Utility functions for manipulating nested dictionaries, including key existence checks, key renaming, key mapping, and dictionary merging.",
  "sources": "Input data is primarily obtained from function arguments such as dictionaries, key lists, and mappings. No external data sources or user inputs are explicitly read within this code.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or output channels handling untrusted data; the code modifies input dictionaries and raises exceptions on errors. No network, file, or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows involve input dictionaries through various transformations: key existence checks, key conversions, renaming, nested dictionary construction, and merging. These are internal transformations without external data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "Potential issues include: improper exception handling (try/except with bare except), recursive function calls without explicit base case validation, and use of mutable default arguments (e.g., 'lst=None', 'loc=None') which can cause unexpected behavior but not maliciousness. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is focused on safe, structural manipulation of nested dictionaries with utility functions. It employs standard Python idioms and does not contain code that interacts with external systems, reads external inputs, or executes system commands. No obfuscated code, malware signatures, or suspicious behaviors are detected. Exception handling could be improved, but it does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code appears purely functional and utility-oriented without any malicious or sabotage elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a set of nested dictionary utilities with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It performs data structure manipulations internally without external data or system interactions. There are no malicious intent indicators or security risks identified.",
