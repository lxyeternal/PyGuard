  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is purely utility functions for nested dicts, no external data, no network, no obfuscation, no malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, standard utility functions with no external interactions or malicious signs.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Slightly more detailed, notes potential issues like bare except, mutable default args, but emphasizes no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious behavior, just some code quality concerns.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Again, utility functions with no external data or network activity, very benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The securityRisk is marginal; perhaps due to potential misuse if untrusted data is passed, but no malicious intent. Scores seem reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to others—benign, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n- **Malware score:** All reports consistently indicate no malware (0). The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports indicate no obfuscation (0). The code is readable and standard.\n- **Risk score:** Very low, mostly 0 or 0.1, justified by the fact that, while safe, passing untrusted data to functions like `nestedkey_rename` or `merge_dict` could cause unexpected issues if misused, but not malicious.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n- **Malware:** **0** — No signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Security risk:** **0.1** — Slightly elevated due to potential misuse or input validation concerns, but not a serious threat.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe provided scores are consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary. The code appears safe, standard, and free of malicious intent.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis assessment aligns with the reports' findings and the code review.",
