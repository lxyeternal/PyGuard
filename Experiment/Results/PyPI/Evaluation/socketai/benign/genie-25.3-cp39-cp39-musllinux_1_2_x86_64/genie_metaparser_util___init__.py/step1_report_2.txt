  "purpose": "Utility functions for manipulating nested dictionaries, including key validation, renaming, mapping, and merging.",
  "sources": "No direct external data input sources; functions operate on provided data structures (dictionaries, lists, tuples).",
  "sinks": "None of the functions perform actions that send data externally, such as network transmission or file I/O.",
  "flows": "Data flows occur within functions manipulating dictionaries and lists, with no external or untrusted data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code performs standard nested dictionary manipulations with straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code offers various utility functions for nested dictionary operations: validation of key existence, conversion of nested keys to list form, renaming nested keys, creating nested dictionaries from key lists, extracting values from nested dictionaries, merging dictionaries, and reforming nested dicts from key lists. All functions rely solely on standard Python data structures and operations, with no external input/output, network activity, or obfuscated constructs. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden code execution. The code appears to be standard utility functions with proper handling of nested structures.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of nested dictionary utility functions with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely to manipulate and validate nested data structures. No malware or suspicious behavior is present.",
