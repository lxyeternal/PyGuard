{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for manipulating nested dictionaries, including key validation, renaming, conversion, and merging.",
  "sources": "Function parameters (dic, key_list, mapping, etc.), input data for functions like keynames_exist, dict_2_list_of_keys, keynames_convert, reform_nestdict_from_keys, get_value_from_nestdict.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; functions mainly manipulate data structures in memory without external output or network operations.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into functions which perform transformations or validation on nested dictionaries, returning modified structures or raising exceptions. No external data sinks identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden dynamic execution detected. No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or system modifications observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions for nested dictionary operations: validation (keynames_exist), key flattening (dict_2_list_of_keys), renaming (nestedkey_rename), key mapping (keynames_convert), nested dictionary creation (create_dict_from_nestedkeys), value retrieval (get_value_from_nestdict), and merging (merge_dict). All functions perform in-memory data manipulations without external interactions. No code indicates data exfiltration, system modification, or network activity. Functions are straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for nested dictionary handling, with no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. It performs standard data manipulation tasks securely. No security risks or malicious intent detected.",
