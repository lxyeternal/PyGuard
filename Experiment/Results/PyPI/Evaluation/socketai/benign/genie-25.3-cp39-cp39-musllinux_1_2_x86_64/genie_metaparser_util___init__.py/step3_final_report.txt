  "purpose": "Utility functions for manipulating nested dictionaries, including key validation, conversion, renaming, and merging.",
  "sources": "Function inputs such as dictionaries, key lists, and mappings; no external data sources or network interactions.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe if untrusted data is passed to functions like nestedkey_rename or merge_dict, which could cause unexpected behavior or errors.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input dictionaries through functions like dict_2_list_of_keys, nestedkey_rename, and merge_dict, with key paths being traversed and modified.",
  "anomalies": "Use of bare except clauses, mutable default arguments in functions, and recursive calls without explicit base case validation; no malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions for nested dictionary management, with straightforward logic and no external interactions. Minor code quality issues such as bare excepts and mutable defaults are present but do not indicate malicious intent. The functions do not perform network operations, file I/O, or obfuscation. The code is readable, standard, and safe, with no signs of malware or sabotage. The slight security risk score (0.1) reflects potential misuse if untrusted data is provided, but no actual vulnerabilities are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for nested dictionary manipulation, with no malicious or obfuscated components. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary.",
