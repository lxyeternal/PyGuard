  "purpose": "Define a base class for genie objects with dynamic attribute setting and representation.",
  "sources": "Keyword arguments in __init__ method, self.name attribute in __repr__ method.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is used in critical security-sensitive functions.",
  "flows": "Input via kwargs -> setattr in __init__ -> optional use of self.name in __repr__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs. Import statements are standard, no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a basic base class with dynamic attribute assignment from kwargs and a custom __repr__ method. There is import of standard modules and a local decorator import. No data from untrusted sources, external network activity, or potentially malicious behavior detected. The code appears to be straightforward object-oriented Python without malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code defines a benign base class for objects within a framework. It does not include any malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It is a standard implementation with no suspicious or harmful elements.",
