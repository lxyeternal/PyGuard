{
  "purpose": "Define a base class for genie objects that initializes attributes from keyword arguments and provides a custom __repr__ method.",
  "sources": "Keyword arguments passed to __init__ method, class attributes",
  "sinks": "None detected; no use of untrusted data sources or sensitive sinks",
  "flows": "Initialization flows from __init__ to setting attributes; no data flows to external systems",
  "anomalies": "Import of importlib.util and functools, but neither is used in the code; no suspicious hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with a constructor that sets attributes based on provided keyword arguments. It attempts a super().__init__ call with kwargs and falls back if a TypeError occurs. The __repr__ method tries to access self.name for a more informative string representation, with a fallback if 'name' doesn't exist. Imports are present but unused, which is benign. No inputs from external untrusted sources, no outputs to external sinks, and no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward base class implementation with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The unused imports do not introduce risk.",
