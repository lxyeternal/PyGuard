{
  "purpose": "The code defines functions for declaring abstraction packages and tokens in a modular framework, mainly for device abstraction and lookup management.",
  "sources": "inspect.getmodule, inspect.stack, re.compile, logging.getLogger, module attributes (__abstract_pkg, __abstract_token, DEFAULT_TOKENS)",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted input is directly used in sensitive operations or data leaks",
  "flows": "inspect.getmodule(inspect.stack()) -> module attributes (__abstract_pkg, __abstract_token) -> AbstractPackage and AbstractToken constructors",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or hardcoded secrets; code is straightforward with no obfuscated patterns, no code injection mechanisms, or suspicious data flows",
  "analysis": "The script provides functions to declare packages and tokens with proper validation, without executing untrusted code or network operations. It utilizes inspect to access module context and dynamically assign attributes. No external data sources, network calls, or suspicious dynamic code execution are present. The use of regular expressions and logging appears standard. The code's logic aligns with normal framework setup routines. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or covert data exfiltration are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard framework utility functions for module and token declaration, with no malicious or suspicious behavior observed. It safely manages internal attributes and uses standard Python practices without any evident security risks.",
