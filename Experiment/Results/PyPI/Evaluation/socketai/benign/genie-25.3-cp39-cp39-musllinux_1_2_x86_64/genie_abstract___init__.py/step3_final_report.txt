{
  "purpose": "These functions facilitate the declaration of device abstraction packages and tokens within a modular framework, using introspection to associate metadata with caller modules.",
  "sources": "The functions read caller module context via inspect.getmodule and inspect.stack.",
  "sinks": "They assign attributes (__abstract_pkg, __abstract_token, DEFAULT_TOKENS) to modules, which are internal and do not leak data externally.",
  "flows": "Input arguments are validated and used to set module attributes, with no external data or network interactions involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. Use of inspect is standard for plugin systems.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard modules (re, inspect, logging) for configuration purposes. It validates arguments, handles errors appropriately, and sets module attributes dynamically. No network, file I/O, or code execution occurs. The regex patterns are straightforward. The functions are designed for framework setup, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for device abstraction configuration, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is low (~0.1), reflecting minimal inherent risk in dynamic attribute assignment within a controlled framework.",
