{
  "purpose": "Defines functions for declaring packages and tokens in an abstraction framework, including setup and configuration logic.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (re, inspect, logging), accesses module attributes via inspect.getmodule, reads arguments from function calls.",
  "sinks": "Assigns attributes to module objects (__abstract_pkg, DEFAULT_TOKENS, __abstract_token), which could influence module behavior.",
  "flows": "User calls declare_package or declare_token; these functions retrieve calling module and assign attributes based on arguments, configuring abstraction tokens/packages.",
  "anomalies": "Uses inspect to access caller module, which is standard but could be misused if called improperly. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. No dynamic code execution observed. The use of regex patterns for import mapping appears safe. No obfuscation or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up an abstraction package and token declaration framework, utilizing introspection to modify module attributes. The import map and logging setup are standard. The functions handle argument parsing carefully, with validation and error handling. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data flows are evident. No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code appears to be part of a larger framework for device abstraction, with focus on configuration rather than execution of untrusted code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a configuration/setup utility for abstraction modules, employing standard introspection and attribute assignment techniques. No signs of malicious or sabotage behavior are detected. It appears to be safe and intended for legitimate configuration purposes.",
