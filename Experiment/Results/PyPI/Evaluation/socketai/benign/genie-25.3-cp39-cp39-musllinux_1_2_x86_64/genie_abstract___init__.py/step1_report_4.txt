{
  "purpose": "This code defines functions and configurations for managing abstraction packages and tokens in a network device modeling context, primarily involving package and token declaration logic.",
  "sources": "inspect.getmodule, inspect.stack, re.compile, logging.getLogger, module attributes (__name__, __file__, __abstract_pkg, __abstract_token, DEFAULT_TOKENS)",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes or outputs untrusted data; it mainly sets attributes and calls constructors. No external network or file outputs are performed.",
  "flows": "inspect.getmodule inspects the caller's module to attach package or token objects. The declare_package and declare_token functions modify module attributes based on input args and kwargs, establishing abstraction configurations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. The code performs standard module inspection and attribute setting. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code is present.",
  "analysis": "The script is primarily focused on defining utility functions for declaring abstraction packages and tokens, relying on standard Python modules such as 'inspect', 're', and 'logging'. It manipulates module attributes based on inputs, with no evident network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious side effects. The re.compile pattern appears to match specific module names, not malicious domains or payloads. The use of inspect to get caller modules is typical in plugin or plugin-like architectures. No obfuscated code, external code injection, or suspicious data handling is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard, benign utility functions for managing device abstraction packages and tokens within a larger framework. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
