  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Use of 'eval', 'exec', environment variables, network functions, base64 decoding, cryptic strings, system commands, input/output handling.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic code execution points, system command invocations, network communication functions, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Sources such as 'eval', 'exec', or input data flow into sinks like system commands or network functions, potentially leading to data exfiltration or malicious payload execution.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation scores, use of 'eval'/'exec', cryptic variable names, base64 decoding, dynamic code execution, unsafe command construction, signs of data exfiltration, suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits multiple suspicious patterns including obfuscation, dynamic execution, and unsafe system commands, indicating potential malicious intent. Benign reports lack such patterns. The high scores in reports 4 and 5 are justified by these behaviors. Moderate suspicion in report 2 aligns with use of obfuscation and dynamic code. Benign reports 1 and 3 show no suspicious activity. The overall suspicion warrants high malware and obfuscation scores, with elevated security risk. The reasoning aligns with the evidence, and scores are consistent with the described behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows significant signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, indicating a high likelihood of malicious behavior. The scores are justified and reflect the potential security threat. Further static and dynamic analysis is recommended before deployment.",
