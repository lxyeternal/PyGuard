  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the 'polling' Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Importing '__version__' from the 'polling' module.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no data sinks or untrusted data usage is evident.",
  "flows": "The '__version__' variable from 'polling' is used in setup to define package version.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py file for packaging a Python project. It imports the package version from 'polling' and passes metadata to 'setuptools.setup()'. There are no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior. The code solely focuses on package configuration and uses well-known setup patterns. The import of '__version__' assumes that 'polling' is a legitimate module with a version attribute, which is common practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It simply configures the packaging of the 'polling' module. No anomalies, malware, or security issues are evident.",
