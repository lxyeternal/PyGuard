{
  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for the 'polling' Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools and polling module (__version__).",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no data sinks are identified.",
  "flows": "The version from polling.__version__ is used in the setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code detected. The code appears standard for a package setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setup' from setuptools and the __version__ attribute from the polling module. It then calls setup() with package metadata, including name, description, version, author info, URL, license, modules, and test requirements. All elements follow typical package setup conventions. No input/output of untrusted data, nor any suspicious behaviors, are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The use of __version__ depends on the polling module, which should be reviewed separately, but based solely on this script, no issues are identified.",
