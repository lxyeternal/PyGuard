{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the polling Python package, used to define package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools and polling.__version__, data provided directly within setup() function.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data is processed or outputted in a manner that could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code simply defines package metadata and dependencies without any data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is standard for Python package setup scripts. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules for package setup, retrieves version info from polling.__version__, and calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies. The code structure is typical for a setup.py file. No code executes external commands, reads environment variables, or performs any untrusted operations. No obfuscated or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup.py script used for packaging a Python module. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The code is straightforward and aligned with typical Python packaging practices.",
