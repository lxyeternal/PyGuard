  "anomalies": "None; standard setup script with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python module. It imports __version__ from polling and uses it in setup(), with no external data handling, code execution, or suspicious behaviors. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, aligning with the benign nature of the script. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present. The code follows standard practices and does not perform any runtime operations beyond configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard packaging configuration with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
