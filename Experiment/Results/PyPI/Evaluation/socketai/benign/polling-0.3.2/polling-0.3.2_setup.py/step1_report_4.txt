  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the polling utility module",
  "sources": "Imports __version__ from polling module, reads package metadata, and specifies dependencies",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling present",
  "flows": "Import __version__ -> use in setup() to assign version",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed; no obfuscated code or suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The script imports the __version__ attribute from the polling module to define the package version. It then calls setup() with metadata and dependencies. The code appears standard for Python packaging with no malicious or suspicious activity, no external data input/output, and no unusual code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python module. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this script.",
