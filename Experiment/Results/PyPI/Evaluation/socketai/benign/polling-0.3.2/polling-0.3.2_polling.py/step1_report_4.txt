{
  "purpose": "A polling utility module providing functions and exceptions to repeatedly call a target function until certain conditions are met or timeouts occur.",
  "sources": "Input sources include the target function called within poll() and external parameters such as timeout, max_tries, ignore_exceptions, and poll_forever. Data is read from function arguments and exception handling.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include returning values from the target function, exceptions caught and stored, and the use of time-related functions. No data is sent over the network or written to disk.",
  "flows": "The main flow involves repeatedly calling the target function, checking success with check_success, handling exceptions, storing values in a queue, and sleeping for a dynamic step. Exceptions and timeouts control exit points.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets detected. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution. The code uses standard libraries and straightforward control flow. Exception handling is typical.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a polling mechanism with configurable wait steps and conditions. It captures exceptions to prevent crashes and provides custom exceptions for timeout and max call scenarios. The code structure is standard and does not contain suspicious or malicious logic. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification code is present. The use of queues and exception handling appears intended for robust polling, not malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard polling utility without signs of malicious behavior. It uses common patterns for retries, exception handling, and configurable behavior. No malicious or harmful code is present. It appears safe for use.",
