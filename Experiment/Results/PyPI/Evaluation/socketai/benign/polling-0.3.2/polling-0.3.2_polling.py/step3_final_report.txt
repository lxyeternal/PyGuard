{
  "purpose": "A polling utility that repeatedly calls a target function until a success condition is met or a timeout/maximum tries is reached.",
  "sources": "The target function call within the polling loop, with arguments passed via args and kwargs.",
  "sinks": "The invocation of the target function, storage of return values in a queue, and exception handling; no malicious sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Source: target function call -> sink: storing return value or exception -> check success condition -> sleep and adjust step -> repeat until success or timeout/tries exhausted.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard polling mechanism with exception handling, success condition checking, and adjustable wait steps. It uses assertions to prevent misconfiguration, and exception handling is controlled. No external network, file, or system modifications are present. The logic is straightforward and aligns with typical utility functions. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward polling utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured, with proper exception handling and configurable parameters. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
