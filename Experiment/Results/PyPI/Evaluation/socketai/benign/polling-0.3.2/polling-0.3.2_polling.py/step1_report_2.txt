{
  "purpose": "This module provides polling functionality with exception handling and helper functions to repeatedly call a target function until a condition is met or a timeout/max retries occur.",
  "sources": "Input data is obtained from the target function invoked within the poll() function, with arguments passed via args and kwargs. No external data sources are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data from the target function can be returned and evaluated by check_success, or stored in the queue. No data is written to external systems or files within this code.",
  "flows": "The main flow involves calling the target function, handling exceptions, checking success condition, storing return values, and controlling polling duration with time and iteration limits.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. The functions and exception classes are straightforward. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are evident. The code uses standard modules and patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a polling mechanism with configurable step intervals, exception handling, and termination conditions based on timeout, max retries, or success check. All components are standard, with no indications of malicious behavior. No obfuscated code, secret leaks, or suspicious data flows are present. The code does not perform network operations or system modifications. It primarily facilitates repeated function calls with exception handling and timing control.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard polling utility designed for reliable repeated function execution with error handling. There are no signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks. The code appears safe and unobfuscated, serving its intended purpose transparently.",
