  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration with a minor security concern due to the use of exec() for version extraction. No malicious activity or malware is present. The current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk (~0.2-0.3) are appropriate. To improve security, replacing exec() with a safer parsing method is recommended, but as-is, the code does not pose a significant threat."
