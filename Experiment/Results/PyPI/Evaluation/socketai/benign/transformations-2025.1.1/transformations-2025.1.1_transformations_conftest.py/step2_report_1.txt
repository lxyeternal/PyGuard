  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard pytest configuration script.\n- The code imports common modules (math, random, numpy, pytest), sets numpy print options, and adds modules to the doctest namespace.\n- No untrusted data, network activity, or data exfiltration is present.\n- No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are detected.\n- The logic is straightforward, serving purely as environment setup for testing.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code does not perform any data manipulation beyond configuration.\n- The use of `random` and `numpy` in the namespace for tests is typical and not inherently malicious.\n- The setting of numpy print options is benign and for formatting output.\n- No anomalies, errors, or flaws are present in the code or the reasoning in the reports.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.5. Given the code's nature, a score of 0 is justified. There's no security risk or vulnerability.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is benign, with no security concerns.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Final note:** The code is a standard testing setup, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The reports correctly identify this.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a benign pytest configuration script.\n- No security risks, malware, or obfuscation detected.\n- Scores are reasonable and justified.",
