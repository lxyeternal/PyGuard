  "purpose": "Configure pytest for testing with specific settings for numpy and including certain modules in the doctest namespace.",
  "sources": "Imports of math, random, numpy, and pytest; setting numpy print options; adding modules to doctest namespace.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code mainly sets configurations and prepares the testing environment.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. Use of standard modules and straightforward configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries (math, random, numpy, pytest) and configures numpy print options. It defines a pytest fixture that sets print options and injects modules into the doctest namespace. All actions are typical for test setup and do not include any malicious or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard pytest configuration snippet with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It simply prepares the testing environment.",
