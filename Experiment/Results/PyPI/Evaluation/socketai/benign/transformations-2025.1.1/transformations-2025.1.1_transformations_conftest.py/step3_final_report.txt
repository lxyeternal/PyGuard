  "purpose": "Configure pytest environment by setting numpy print options and injecting standard modules into the doctest namespace for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports of math, random, numpy, and pytest; setting numpy print options; adding modules to doctest_namespace.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external communication or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Modules imported and added to namespace without data flow from untrusted sources; configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard for test setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and configures numpy print options, then injects these modules into the doctest namespace via a fixture. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code does not handle untrusted data, perform network operations, or manipulate external systems. The use of 'random' and 'numpy' in the namespace is typical for testing. The logic is simple and clear, serving purely as environment setup for tests.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard pytest configuration snippet. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
