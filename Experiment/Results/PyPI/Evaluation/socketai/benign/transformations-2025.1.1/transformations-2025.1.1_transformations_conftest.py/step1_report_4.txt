{
  "purpose": "Configure pytest testing environment and set options for numpy and include common libraries in doctest namespace.",
  "sources": "Imports of math, random, numpy, and pytest; setting numpy print options; adding math, numpy, and random to doctest namespace.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Initialization of libraries, configuration of numpy print options, injection of libraries into doctest namespace.",
  "anomalies": "Use of random and numpy in doctest namespace could allow exposure of internal states in tests but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports standard libraries and sets print options for numpy, which are benign. The 'doctest_config' fixture adds math, numpy, and random modules to the doctest namespace for testing purposes. There are no signs of malicious code such as network activity, data exfiltration, backdoors, or code obfuscation. The configuration appears straightforward and intended for testing environment setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pytest configuration for testing, with no malicious behavior or security risks observed. It simply manages library setup for tests and does not perform any suspicious actions.",
