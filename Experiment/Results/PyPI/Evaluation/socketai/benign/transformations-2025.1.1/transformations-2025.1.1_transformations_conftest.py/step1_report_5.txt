  "purpose": "Configure pytest environment and doctest namespace for numerical and mathematical operations.",
  "sources": "Imports of math, random, numpy modules; set_printoptions calls; doctest_namespace dictionary modifications.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious effects; no untrusted data handling or output to external systems.",
  "flows": "Import modules -> set numpy print options -> inject modules into doctest namespace.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Usage of standard libraries in a typical testing setup.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up configurations for pytest and doctest environments, including numpy print options and injecting math, numpy, and random modules into the doctest namespace. All operations are standard and do not perform any data collection, external communication, or potentially malicious activities. No unusual or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical testing configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
