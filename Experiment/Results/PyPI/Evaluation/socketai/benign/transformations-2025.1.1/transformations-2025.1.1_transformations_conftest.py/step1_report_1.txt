  "purpose": "Configure pytest and doctest environment with specific modules and print options.",
  "sources": "Imports of math, random, numpy, and pytest; setting numpy print options; adding modules to doctest namespace.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code only modifies local configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard for testing setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports common Python modules and a third-party library (numpy), then sets print options for numpy. It defines a pytest fixture that adds math, numpy, and random modules to the doctest namespace, allowing their use in inline tests. All operations are standard configuration steps for testing and do not involve any data collection, transmission, or manipulation of untrusted input. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard pytest configuration for testing purposes. It only sets environment options and exposes modules in the doctest namespace without any malicious intent or security risks.",
