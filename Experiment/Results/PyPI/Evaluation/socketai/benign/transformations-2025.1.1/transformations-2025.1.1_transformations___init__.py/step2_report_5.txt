  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code snippets, their logic, and the scoring assigned.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe similar code: importing __doc__, __version__, and using 'import *' from a local module.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted data is evident.\n- The use of 'import *' is noted as poor practice but not malicious.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious intent are detected.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.8\n- **Assessment:** The high risk score (0.8) is unjustified. The code is standard package initialization, with no security issues. The confidence is 0.8, which is reasonable, but the risk should be closer to 0.\n- **Recommendation:** Reduce risk score to 0.1 or 0, as there's no malicious or security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The risk score aligns well with the analysis. The use of wildcard import is noted but not inherently dangerous. The confidence is high (0.9).\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate, no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** The analysis and score are consistent. No malicious activity or security issues.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports; the minor risk due to wildcard import is acknowledged but not significant.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score due to wildcard import, but still not indicative of malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final thoughts:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** The initial high score in Report 1 is unjustified; it should be lowered to match the others, around 0.1 or 0.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (consistent with the cautious approach to wildcard imports but recognizing the code's benign nature)\n\n**Summary:** The code is standard package initialization, with no malicious or security issues. The only concern is the use of 'import *', which is stylistic rather than security-related.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:** Adjust Report 1's risk score from 0.8 down to approximately 0.1 to align with the other assessments. The malware and obfuscated scores remain at 0.",
