  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package initializer with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The main concern is the stylistic use of 'import *', which does not elevate the security risk. Therefore, all scores for malware and obfuscation should remain at 0, and the risk score should be adjusted to approximately 0.1 to acknowledge the stylistic concern without implying security issues."
