  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'transformations' package, including reading code files, extracting metadata, and configuring the build.",
  "sources": "Reading 'transformations/transformations.py' file, opening and writing 'README.rst' and 'LICENSE' files.",
  "sinks": "Writing to files ('README.rst', 'LICENSE'), and reading source files. No untrusted input handling or network operations detected.",
  "flows": "Reads source code to extract version, description, and license info. Writes updated documentation and license files during sdist.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated segments. No dynamic code execution, network access, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup procedures: file reading, regex pattern matching for metadata, updating documentation files, and configuring build parameters. The functions are straightforward and do not involve untrusted data handling or dangerous operations. No indications of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It handles source file parsing and file writing securely without executing untrusted code or network activity.",
