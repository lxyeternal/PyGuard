{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'transformations' Python package, managing package metadata and build processes.",
  "sources": "Reading files ('transformations/transformations.py'), using 'sys.argv' to determine build actions.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly executes untrusted data or writes sensitive data. File operations are controlled and standard.",
  "flows": "File reading flows into string processing and regex matching to extract metadata. No external data flows or network communications are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; the script performs typical setup tasks. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script reads package source files to extract version, description, and license info using regex. It conditionally updates README and LICENSE files during source distribution ('sdist'), ensuring documentation consistency. The code uses standard Python practices, file I/O, and 'setuptools' for packaging. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious injections, or suspicious behaviors. The overall functionality is typical for a setup script with no external or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It performs metadata extraction, documentation updates, and package configuration without any malicious intent or security risks.",
