{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for the 'transformations' package, performing metadata extraction, documentation updates, and package configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads 'transformations/transformations.py' for version, description, and license info; reads and writes files such as README.rst and LICENSE.",
  "sinks": "Writes to 'README.rst' and 'LICENSE' files during 'sdist' build process.",
  "flows": "Reads source code to extract metadata, then writes documentation and license files; no external data or network activity involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Regex usage and file operations are standard.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical package setup tasks: reading source files, extracting metadata via regex, updating documentation during source distribution. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or obfuscated code are present. File I/O is limited to local files, and the regex patterns are straightforward. The code structure is clear and standard for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals indicate safe behavior, and the scores should reflect zero malware, zero obfuscation, and minimal security risk.",
