  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script is a standard setup script; no malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code performs typical package setup tasks: reading files, regex extraction, updating documentation, and writing license files. No external network activity, no code injection, no obfuscated code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk=0.0, confidence=1.0\n- **Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1; standard setup procedures with no malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly notes the straightforward file reading, regex parsing, and documentation updates. No signs of external threats or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk=0.1 (small, due to minimal risk from file operations), confidence=0.95\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate. The small security risk score is justified given the file I/O, but no actual threat.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a typical setup script, no malicious activity or suspicious patterns.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior—simple file reads, regex parsing, and file writing. No external or untrusted data handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk=0.0\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard setup script, no malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly identifies the straightforward nature of the code, regex extraction, and file operations.\n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk=0.1 (again, minimal risk from file handling)\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; the script performs expected setup tasks without external threats or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk=0.0\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Checking for Malicious Indicators:\n\n- **Code Analysis:** The code is a typical setup script. It reads source files, extracts metadata with regex, updates documentation, and configures packaging. No dynamic code execution, no network calls, no untrusted input handling beyond reading local files, and no obfuscation.\n- **Malware/Obfuscation:** No signs of malware or obfuscation in the code.\n- **Security Risks:** Very low; only standard file I/O, regex parsing, and package configuration.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Given the code's nature, I agree with all reports' malware scores of 0.0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation; 0.0 is appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** The minimal risk scores (~0.0 to 0.1) are justified due to file operations, but no actual security threat exists.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** **0.0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Security Risk:** **0.05** (very low, standard setup script with minimal risk from file operations)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** All reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is a typical, benign setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.",
