  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checkting the provided code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the script as a setup script reading 'transformations.py' to extract version, description, and license info.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No suspicious data flow; standard file operations.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns. The regex and file I/O are standard.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, aligns with the code, no malicious activity.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0.0 (no malicious activity)  \n- Obfuscated: 0.0 (no obfuscation)  \n- Risk: 0.0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, with slightly more cautious language regarding the absence of suspicious behavior.  \n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Also accurate.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0.0  \n- Obfuscated: 0.0  \n- Risk: 0.1 (very low, possibly due to general caution)\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Again, confirms standard setup procedures, no suspicious patterns, no external or untrusted data handling.  \n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Consistent with the code.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0.0  \n- Obfuscated: 0.0  \n- Risk: 0.0\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Similar assessment, emphasizes standard regex and file handling, no dynamic code execution or obfuscation.  \n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0.0  \n- Obfuscated: 0.0  \n- Risk: 0.1 (again, very low)\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Same overall conclusion: standard setup script, no malicious activity, no obfuscation, straightforward file I/O.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0.0  \n- Obfuscated: 0.0  \n- Risk: 0.0\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0.0, which is appropriate. The code performs no malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports indicate 0.0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code's nature—reading files, regex parsing, writing documentation—there's no real security risk. The slight non-zero in some reports (0.1) seems to reflect a conservative stance, but it's not justified given the code.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** **0.0** — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** **0.0** — no security risks detected.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured setup script with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior. The scores should reflect this, with zero for malware, obfuscated code, and security risk.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0  \n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus among the reports.",
