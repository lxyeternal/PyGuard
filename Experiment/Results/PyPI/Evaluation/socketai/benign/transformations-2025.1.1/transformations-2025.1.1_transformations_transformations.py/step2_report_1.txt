  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the context, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard 3D transformation library with no malicious intent. The only noteworthy aspect is the dynamic import of a module '_transformations', which is optional and common in modular libraries.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis; no malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — the code is clear, well-documented, and not obfuscated.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0 — the code is a mathematical library with no evident security issues.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to report 1, emphasizing the lack of network, file, or malicious code. The dynamic import of '_transformations' is noted but deemed benign.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate; no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — the code is transparent.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — very low, considering the dynamic import, but it's a common pattern.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning is sound. The low risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is a standard 3D transformation library. The only \"anomaly\" is the dynamic import of '_transformations', which is typical for extension points.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent; no malware detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code clarity confirmed.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal, considering the import pattern.\n\n**Verdict:** Justified. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion: a mathematical library with no malicious intent. The dynamic import is a benign extension mechanism.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0 — very low, given the context.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Consistent with previous, emphasizing the safety and standard nature of the code, with the dynamic import being safe.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — justified.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — acceptable, considering the dynamic import pattern.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- The code is a well-documented, open-source library for 3D transformations, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n- The dynamic import of '_transformations' is a typical pattern for optional extensions, not malicious.\n\n- No network, file, or external command execution is present.\n\n- The scores assigned across reports are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n### My independent estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malware or malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — the code is clear and readable.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — very low, mainly due to the dynamic import pattern, which is benign but should be noted.\n\n---\n\n**Final conclusion:** The reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is a legitimate, mathematical, open-source 3D transformation library with no malicious or sabotage elements.",
