  "purpose": "A comprehensive Python library for 3D homogeneous transformations, including matrices, quaternions, Euler angles, and user interaction via Arcball. It is intended for graphics and geometric computations.",
  "sources": "Function parameters, internal variables, and optional module '_transformations' loaded via dynamic import.",
  "sinks": "Matrices, vectors, and internal data; no external network, file, or command execution.",
  "flows": "Purely mathematical data flow within functions; no external data leaks or malicious data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic import of '_transformations' module, which is a common pattern for optional extensions, not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, documented mathematical library for 3D transformations. It contains no obfuscation, no network activity, and no malicious code. The dynamic import pattern is typical for modular extensions and does not indicate sabotage. The scores assigned across the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the code's content and context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, open-source 3D transformation library with no malicious or sabotage intent. The dynamic import is a benign extension mechanism, and the overall security risk is negligible. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is 0.1, justified by the extension pattern.",
