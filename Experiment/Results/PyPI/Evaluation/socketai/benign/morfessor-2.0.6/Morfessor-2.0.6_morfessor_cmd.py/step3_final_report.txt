  "purpose": "A command-line interface (CLI) utility for training, segmenting, and evaluating Morfessor models, handling data files, models, annotations, and output formatting.",
  "sources": "File inputs for training, testing, annotations; command-line arguments; in-memory model and data structures.",
  "sinks": "File outputs for models, segmentations, lexicons; logs; in-memory data processing; no network or external system calls.",
  "flows": "Data flows from files into models and annotations; processed via model methods; results written to files or stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or external command execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard CLI utility for morphological modeling, with argument parsing, logging, file I/O, and model operations. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code handles untrusted input files as expected for such tools, but this does not constitute a security risk. Use of caching and standard libraries indicates typical implementation patterns. No network activity or dynamic code execution is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign CLI utility for morphological analysis and model management. It shows no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is effectively zero.",
