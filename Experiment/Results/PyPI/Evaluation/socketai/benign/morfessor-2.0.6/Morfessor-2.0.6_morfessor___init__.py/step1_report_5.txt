{
  "purpose": "The code provides a Python implementation of the Morfessor method, including definitions of models, utilities, and command-line interface functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads metadata such as version, author info, and imports modules and functions from internal packages.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or untrusted data handling observed; no network, file, or environment variable operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks; primarily module imports and definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code appears to be a standard library implementation with proper structure.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of metadata, logging setup, versioning, author information, and imports of internal modules. It does not perform any network operations, file manipulations, or dynamic code execution. The import statements are standard and relate to a well-documented library. No obfuscated or malicious constructs are evident. The code appears to be a legitimate, open-source implementation of a linguistic algorithm with no indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard library module for Morfessor 2.0, containing no malicious or suspicious behaviors. It is unlikely to be harmful or compromised.",
