{
  "purpose": "The code appears to implement a Python package for the Morfessor method, likely for morphological segmentation or related NLP tasks.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (.baseline, .cmd, .exception, .io, .utils, .evaluation) and package metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data are present; the code does not process external input or data streams directly.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths involving untrusted sources to sensitive sinks are evident. The code mainly sets up imports and package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code, are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of package metadata, import statements, and a function to retrieve version information. It does not perform any data processing, input handling, or network operations. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. All imported modules are standard for a package setup and functionality. The structure appears normal for a Python package main module.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard package initialization script for the Morfessor Python library. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The code is clean, with no suspicious signals, and adheres to typical package setup practices.",
