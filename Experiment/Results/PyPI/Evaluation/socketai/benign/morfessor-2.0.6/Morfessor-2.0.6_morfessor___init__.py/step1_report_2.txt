{
  "purpose": "This code provides the initial setup and module imports for the Morfessor 2.0 package, a Python implementation of the Morfessor segmentation method.",
  "sources": "Imports from the same package modules (baseline, cmd, exception, io, utils, evaluation)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks are present in this code segment",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no data flows involving untrusted sources or sinks in this code",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of metadata, documentation, logger setup, and import statements from internal modules. It defines version and author info, sets up the logger, and organizes imports for public API exposure. There are no inputs, outputs, data processing, or external network interactions. All imported modules are part of the same package, and no potentially malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard package initialization script with no signs of malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscated code. It merely organizes imports and defines metadata.",
