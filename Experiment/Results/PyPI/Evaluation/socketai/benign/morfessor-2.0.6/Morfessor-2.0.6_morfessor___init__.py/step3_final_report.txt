{
  "purpose": "This code serves as the main module or __init__.py for the Morfessor 2.0 Python package, defining metadata, setting up logging, and importing internal components to expose the public API.",
  "sources": "Internal module imports (baseline, cmd, exception, io, utils, evaluation) and package metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, network activity, or untrusted input handling present.",
  "flows": "Static import statements and metadata assignments; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package initialization script, with no dynamic execution, external data handling, or network operations. All imports are internal, and the structure aligns with standard Python package practices. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is organizational, providing metadata and exposing internal modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for a Python package's __init__.py or main module, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriately set to zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, reflecting its safe and transparent nature.",
