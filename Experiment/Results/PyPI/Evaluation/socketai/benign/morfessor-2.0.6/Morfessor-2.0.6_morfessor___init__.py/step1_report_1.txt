  "purpose": "This code provides the initial setup and imports for the Morfessor 2.0 Python package, which implements morphological segmentation algorithms.",
  "sources": "The code reads metadata, version info, author details, and imports various components from local modules such as baseline, cmd, exception, io, utils, and evaluation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present. No external input/output or data transmission is performed within this snippet.",
  "flows": "The code primarily establishes module structure and imports; no data flow from sources to sinks is visible here.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, unusual code patterns, or obfuscated elements. The code appears straightforward and standard for a Python package initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code defines package metadata, sets up logging, and imports various components from submodules at the end of the file to ensure package namespace availability. No user input, external data, or sensitive information handling is evident. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or hidden behaviors are present. The structure follows conventional Python package patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, benign package initialization script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
