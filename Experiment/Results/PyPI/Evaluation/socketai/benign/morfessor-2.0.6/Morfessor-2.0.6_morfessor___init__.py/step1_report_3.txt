{
  "purpose": "This code serves as the main module for the Morfessor 2.0 Python implementation, providing an API for morphological segmentation, including version info, author details, and importing key components for the package.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules (.baseline, .cmd, .exception, .io, .utils, .evaluation) and metadata variables (__version__, __author__, etc.)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or network communications; no execution of external code or input handling shown",
  "flows": "No evident source-to-sink data flow; primarily static imports and metadata",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns. The imports are standard for a Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes logging, defines metadata, and imports various components of the package from local modules. It includes a function to return version info. The structure is typical for a Python package __init__.py file, with no dynamic code execution, external input handling, or suspicious code behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard package initialization file with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks detected. It mainly sets up metadata and imports necessary modules for the Morfessor package.",
