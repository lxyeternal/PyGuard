      "conclusion": "The script itself is benign and performs standard installation tasks. However, it downloads and executes setup.py scripts from external URLs without verification, which could lead to remote code execution if the source is malicious. The malware score should be increased to reflect this potential risk, even though the code does not contain malicious payloads by design. The obfuscation score is appropriate at zero. The overall security risk is moderate to high due to unverified external code execution, estimated at 0.7."
