  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for the Morfessor application, serving as error handling infrastructure.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from Exception, with message formatting in constructors.",
  "sinks": "No external data input/output, network calls, or file operations; no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of exception classes with static messages; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected; straightforward class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions used for error handling, with no external interactions, data processing, or malicious patterns. The exception messages are static and descriptive. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are present. The code is standard and benign, with no security vulnerabilities or malicious intent identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of exception class definitions with no security concerns, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. All reports correctly assess the code as safe, with scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk set to 0. The analysis is consistent and accurate.",
