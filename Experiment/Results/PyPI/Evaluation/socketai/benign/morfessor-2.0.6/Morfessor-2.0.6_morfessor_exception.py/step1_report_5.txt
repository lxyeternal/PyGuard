{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling errors in a Morfessor-based module.",
  "sources": "The code reads input only from within class constructors for error messages.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing functions that handle untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines exception classes and messages.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of exception class definitions. It uses standard Python exception inheritance, with no dynamic code execution, network access, or data handling. The messages are static and do not incorporate external or untrusted input. The code does not interact with external systems or perform any I/O beyond class constructor calls. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. It appears to be a typical, benign module for error handling in a larger project.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign set of custom exception classes with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
