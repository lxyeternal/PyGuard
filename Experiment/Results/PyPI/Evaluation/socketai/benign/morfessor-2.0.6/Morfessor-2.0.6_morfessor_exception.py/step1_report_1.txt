{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for a Morfessor-based application, primarily for error handling.",
  "sources": "None, the code only contains class definitions and exception handling logic.",
  "sinks": "None, there are no data flows or input/output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths involving untrusted sources to sinks exist in this code.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic; the code is straightforward class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from Python's Exception class. It includes constructors for specific error conditions related to a Morfessor model. There are no data inputs, outputs, or external calls. No indication of malicious behavior such as network activity, file access, or code injection. The code appears to be standard exception handling setup for a Python package, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a set of custom exception classes for a larger application. No malicious intent or security risks are present.",
