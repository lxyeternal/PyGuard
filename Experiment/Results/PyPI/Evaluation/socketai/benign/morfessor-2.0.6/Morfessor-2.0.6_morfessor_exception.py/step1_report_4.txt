{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to Morfessor models and operations.",
  "sources": "None; the code solely contains class definitions and exception handling logic.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input, output, or untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks as the code does not process or handle runtime data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The exception messages are straightforward and relevant.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of custom exception class definitions for a Morfessor-related module. It inherits from Python's base Exception class and defines specific exceptions with custom messages. No external inputs, data processing, or security-sensitive operations are present. The structure and content are typical for error handling modules, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exceptions for a Python module. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. It appears safe and normal for its intended purpose.",
