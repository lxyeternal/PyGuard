{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling within the Morfessor module.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes and methods, no input sources present.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external outputs in the code.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from source to sink as no data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions, inheriting from Python's Exception class. Each class provides specific error messages for different error conditions in the Morfessor project, such as invalid categories, operations, or unsupported configurations. There is no dynamic code execution, external data handling, or suspicious activity. The code structure is straightforward and typical for error handling in Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as part of the error handling infrastructure for the project without any harmful elements.",
