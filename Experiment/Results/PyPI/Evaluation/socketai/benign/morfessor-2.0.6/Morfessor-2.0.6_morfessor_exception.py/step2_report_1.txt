  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Purpose: Defines custom exception classes for a Morfessor application.  \n- Content: Only class definitions inheriting from Exception, with no data flow, external calls, or suspicious code.  \n- Conclusion: Benign, no malicious activity.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n**Assessment:** Fully consistent. No issues.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Purpose: Similar to Report 1, defining error classes.  \n- Content: Straightforward class definitions with no external interactions or data handling.  \n- Conclusion: No malicious behavior.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n**Assessment:** Fully consistent.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Purpose: Same as above, error handling classes.  \n- Content: No external data, no network or file operations, only exception class definitions with message formatting.  \n- Conclusion: Benign.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n**Assessment:** Consistent.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Purpose: Same, custom exceptions for Morfessor.  \n- Content: Standard exception classes, no suspicious code.  \n- Conclusion: Safe.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n**Assessment:** No issues.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Purpose: Same purpose, defining error classes.  \n- Content: Straightforward class definitions, no external or malicious activity.  \n- Conclusion: Benign.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n**Assessment:** Fully consistent.  \n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code correctness:** All reports correctly identify that the code is just class definitions for exception handling.\n- **Malware risk:** None of the reports indicate any malicious behavior. All scores for malware are zero, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation detected; all scores are zero.\n- **Security risk:** The code is benign, with no external data handling, network activity, or suspicious patterns. Scores are zero.\n- **Logic and reasoning:** The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Overall conclusion:** The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** No changes are necessary; the evaluation aligns perfectly with the code's content and behavior.",
