{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for a Morfessor-related module, facilitating error handling and specific exception reporting.",
  "sources": "The code reads from imported modules (__future__, Exception), and from parameters passed into exception constructors.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or output based on external input.",
  "flows": "Input data (exception parameters) flows into exception objects, which are then used for error reporting.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code uses standard exception class definitions with straightforward message formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines custom exception classes inheriting from Python's Exception. The constructors initialize the exceptions with formatted messages, but do not perform any operations beyond object creation. No external data input, network operations, or file manipulations are present. No obfuscated code, hidden behaviors, or suspicious patterns are detected. The structure and syntax are clear and standard for Python exception definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical set of custom exception class definitions intended for error handling within a module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious data handling, or security risks.",
