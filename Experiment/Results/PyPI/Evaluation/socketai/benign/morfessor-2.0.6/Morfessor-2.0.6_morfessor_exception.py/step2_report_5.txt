  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims, scores, and potential security implications.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code only contains class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from Python's Exception class.\n- No data input/output, network activity, file access, or external calls are present.\n- Exception messages are static and only include parameters passed during instantiation.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code appears to be standard error handling infrastructure for a Python project.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Issues in code?**  \n  The code matches the description; no issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are present. The code is straightforward and serves as error handling classes.\n\n- **Malware?**  \n  No, there's no evidence of malicious activity, such as code injection, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n\n- **Obfuscated?**  \n  No, the code is clear and readable.\n\n- **Security risk?**  \n  Zero, as it only defines exception classes.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation of each report:\n\n#### Reports 1-5:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is solely class definitions for custom exceptions.\n- They all assign a confidence of 1, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- The \"malware\" score is 0 in all, consistent with the analysis.\n- The \"obfuscated\" score is 0, also consistent.\n- The \"securityRisk\" score is 0, which is correct.\n\n**Are the scores reasonable?**  \nYes. The scores reflect the benign, straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical points and potential issues:\n\n- The reports do not identify any issues with the code, which is accurate.\n- The code does not process untrusted data or perform any operations that could introduce vulnerabilities.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are present.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nAll reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. The code is benign, with no security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0  \n\nThe code is a standard, safe set of exception class definitions with no security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nEnsure that in the larger context of the application, these exception classes are used appropriately, but based solely on this code snippet, there are no security concerns.",
