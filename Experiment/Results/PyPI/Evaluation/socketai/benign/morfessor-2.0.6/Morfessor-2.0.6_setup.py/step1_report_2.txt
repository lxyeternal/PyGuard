{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the Morfessor Python package, used to define package metadata and installation requirements.",
  "sources": "Reading 'morfessor/__init__.py' for version and author metadata; reading 'docs/build_requirements.txt' for optional dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks; no code executes untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Reading package metadata from source files; defining package installation parameters; no dynamic code execution or data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The script uses 'ez_setup' and 'use_setuptools()', which are outdated but not malicious; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py configuration for Python packaging. It reads package metadata from a source file, specifies dependencies, and defines installation parameters. No untrusted data handling, no dynamic code execution, and no external network activity are present. The use of deprecated modules ('ez_setup') does not imply malicious intent but indicates outdated practices.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical Python package setup file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware or obfuscated code. Overall, the code appears safe and intended for legitimate package installation purposes.",
