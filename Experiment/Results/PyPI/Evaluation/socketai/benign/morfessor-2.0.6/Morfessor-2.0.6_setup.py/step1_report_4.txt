  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the Morfessor package, including metadata, dependencies, and scripts.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata from 'morfessor/__init__.py' and requirements from external text files.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'setuptools.setup' to install the package; no untrusted data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Reads metadata and dependencies from external files, then passes these to setup() for installation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. Uses 'ez_setup' and 'setuptools' as standard setup tools.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard Python package setup process. It dynamically extracts metadata from a source file and reads external dependencies and requirements, then calls 'setup()' with these parameters. No malicious code, obfuscated segments, or suspicious data flows are present. External dependencies are commented out or benign. The code structure and functions are consistent with common packaging scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears safe and intended for normal package installation.",
