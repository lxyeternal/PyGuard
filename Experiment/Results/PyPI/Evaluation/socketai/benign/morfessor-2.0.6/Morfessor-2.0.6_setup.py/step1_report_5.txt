  "purpose": "This script is used to set up and package the Morfessor Python project for distribution, including metadata, dependencies, and scripts.",
  "sources": "Reads the contents of 'morfessor/__init__.py' to extract version and author metadata; reads 'docs/build_requirements.txt' for additional dependencies.",
  "sinks": "Uses the 'setuptools' setup function to process package metadata and dependencies; reads external files for metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "Reads __init__.py to extract metadata -> processes dependencies from external files -> calls setup() with this data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network operations, or hidden code observed. The code performs standard setup procedures with no unusual behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup operations using setuptools. It extracts metadata via regex from a local file, reads dependency requirements from a text file, and invokes setup() with appropriate arguments. No external code execution, network connections, or dynamic code execution is present. The use of 'ez_setup' and 'use_setuptools()' is a legacy approach but not malicious. Overall, the code appears to be a typical setup script without any malicious intent or suspicious anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It simply prepares the package metadata, dependencies, and scripts for distribution.",
