{
  "purpose": "The code sets up and configures a Python package named 'Morfessor' for distribution, including metadata, dependencies, and scripts.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'morfessor/__init__.py' file for metadata, and reads 'docs/build_requirements.txt' for additional requirements.",
  "streams": "Metadata extraction from __init__.py to set package info, reading dependencies from files for setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; standard setup script usage.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard Python packaging tools (setuptools) to configure the package, extracting metadata via regex from a __init__.py file, which is typical. It reads dependencies and extra requirements from text files. No code execution or external network activity is evident. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected in the setup process.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal setup script for packaging a Python project, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
