{
  "purpose": "To set up and configure the Morfessor Python package for distribution, including metadata, dependencies, and scripts.",
  "sources": "Reading the __init__.py file for metadata, reading the 'docs/build_requirements.txt' for optional dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the script primarily reads files and sets up package metadata without executing untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Metadata extraction from __init__.py to package setup; reading dependencies from files; no data flows leading to potentially dangerous actions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'ez_setup' and 'use_setuptools()' are outdated but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious URLs or commands.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration script for a Python package. It reads package metadata from the __init__.py file and dependencies from a text file. The use of 'ez_setup' and 'use_setuptools()' is somewhat deprecated but harmless. There are no indications of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior. No suspicious network activity, data leaks, or code injections are present. The script only performs package setup tasks.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate setup script for the Morfessor package with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It functions solely to facilitate package installation and metadata management.",
