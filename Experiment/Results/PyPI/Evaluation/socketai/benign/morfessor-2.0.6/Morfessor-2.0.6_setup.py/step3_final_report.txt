{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging the Morfessor Python project, reading metadata from the source, dependencies from external files, and configuring package installation via setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads metadata from 'morfessor/__init__.py' and dependencies from 'docs/build_requirements.txt'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external network activity or code execution beyond local file reading.",
  "flows": "Metadata and dependencies are read from local files; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated 'ez_setup' and 'use_setuptools()' but no malicious or suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks with straightforward code. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is present. The regex for metadata extraction is simple and common. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected. The outdated practices are noted but do not constitute security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk ~0.1) are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
