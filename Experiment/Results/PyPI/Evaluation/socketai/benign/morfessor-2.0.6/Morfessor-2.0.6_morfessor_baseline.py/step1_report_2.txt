  "purpose": "This code implements a Morfessor-based model for morphological segmentation, training, and encoding. It includes classes for the model, data encoding, and corpus weight updating, designed to facilitate unsupervised and semi-supervised segmentation tasks.",
  "sources": "Imports standard Python modules, such as collections, heapq, logging, math, numbers, re; imports internal modules .utils and .exception; reads input data through methods like load_data and load_segmentations; reads annotations via set_annotations; reads compounds and segmentations for analysis and training.",
  "sinks": "Uses untrusted input in load_data, load_segmentations, and online training data streams. Uses random functions (random.random) for skipping or splitting. Performs file operations are not present. No network operations are observed. No use of environment variables or system commands. No code injection points or reflective code present.",
  "flows": "Data sources flow into load_data and load_segmentations methods, which update internal state (_analyses, _corpus_coding, etc.). During training, data flows through _recursive_optimize, _viterbi_optimize, and segmentation methods, affecting analysis and lexicon counts. Random skipping and forced splits influence control flow but are internally bounded. Cost calculations and updates influence model parameters, but no external system calls are performed.",
  "anomalies": "Code contains standard model implementation with no unusual or suspicious code patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. Usage of random number generators is for stochastic processes within training but not malicious. The penalty attribute is set to an extremely low value (-9999.9), which is benign but could influence cost calculations, though not malicious. No unusual file I/O, network, or external system interactions are present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a morphological segmentation model with classes for managing analyses, training, encoding, and updating corpus weights. All functions perform legitimate operations such as counting, segmentation, and probabilistic modeling. Usage of random functions is standard for stochastic training, not suspicious. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or unauthorized data access are detected. The code relies on standard libraries and internal modules for utils and exceptions, with no suspicious imports or reflective operations. No external system calls or network interactions are present. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a morphological segmentation framework with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of a Morfessor-based morphological segmentation and encoding framework. It does not contain malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. Usage of randomness is confined to training procedures, and there are no external or covert operations that pose security threats.",
