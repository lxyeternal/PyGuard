{
  "purpose": "This code provides classes and functions for evaluating machine learning models, particularly focusing on segmentation quality and statistical significance testing using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from reference annotations, model predictions, and evaluation configurations. It also reads internal data structures such as dictionaries, lists, and random seed values.",
  "sinks": "The code performs in-memory calculations and logging; it does not contain any direct network connections, file writes, or system command executions that could leak data or perform harmful actions.",
  "flows": "Input data from reference annotations and model outputs flow into evaluation functions, which compute metrics and store results in objects. The evaluation results can be formatted or analyzed statistically, but there are no external sinks like network or file system operations involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscated code are present. The use of the 'random' module appears to be solely for sampling; no dynamic code execution, eval, exec, or similar functions are used. Logging is standard. No encrypted data or covert channels are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured implementation of evaluation and statistical testing routines for segmentation models. It uses standard Python libraries and idioms, with no indications of malicious behavior. The only potentially noteworthy aspect is the use of 'random.Random' for reproducible sampling, which is a normal practice. All operations are memory-based, with no network, file, or system command interactions. There are no obfuscated or suspicious constructs, nor hardcoded secrets or backdoors. The statistical calculations and data processing are straightforward and align with common evaluation workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate evaluation suite for segmentation models and statistical analysis. There are no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It operates purely in-memory and logs its processes without any external harmful actions.",
