{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes and functions for evaluating morphological segmentation models, including sampling, statistical testing, and performance metrics.",
  "sources": "Uses input data from reference_annotations, model.viterbi_segment(), and evaluation configurations. Reads no external or untrusted input streams.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not write or transmit untrusted data or perform sensitive operations such as network access or file writing.",
  "flows": "The data flows from reference annotations through evaluation procedures, with no external or untrusted data sinks or malicious data manipulations observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code structures, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. Uses standard Python libraries and straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code implements evaluation and statistical testing for morphological segmentation models, utilizing sampling, caching, and statistical functions. No indications of malicious intent or suspicious behavior are present. The only notable aspect is the use of random sampling with seed-based reproducibility, which is standard for evaluation purposes. No external data input or transmission, nor system modification, is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate evaluation framework for morphological segmentation models, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs statistical evaluation and sampling securely without external or harmful actions.",
