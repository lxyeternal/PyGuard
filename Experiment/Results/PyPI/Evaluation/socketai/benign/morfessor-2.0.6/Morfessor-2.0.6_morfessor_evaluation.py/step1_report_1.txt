{
  "purpose": "The code provides statistical evaluation and analysis tools for model performance, including sample creation, evaluation metrics, and statistical significance testing.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are the reference annotations (dictionary of compounds and annotations) and model predictions (via viterbi_segment method). Data is read from these data structures and external model methods.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain explicit sinks such as network calls, file writes, or system commands. It primarily processes data in-memory and outputs formatted results or logs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reference annotations into evaluation objects, which generate samples, evaluate predictions, and store results. The results can be statistically compared using the Wilcoxon test functions.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs. Use of the 'random' module for sampling is standard practice, although a specific seed is used for reproducibility. Logging is used for debugging purposes but not for malicious activities.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a well-structured statistical evaluation suite for language modeling or segmentation tasks. It includes sample generation, evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F-score), and statistical tests (Wilcoxon). No code appears to perform external communication, data exfiltration, or system modification. The use of 'random' for reproducible sampling is normal. There are no signs of obfuscated code or hidden behaviors. The only potential concern is the use of random sampling with a fixed seed, which is a benign practice here.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard evaluation toolkit without any malicious intent. It performs statistical analysis, sample creation, and result reporting. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. It appears safe for use as part of a language model evaluation pipeline.",
