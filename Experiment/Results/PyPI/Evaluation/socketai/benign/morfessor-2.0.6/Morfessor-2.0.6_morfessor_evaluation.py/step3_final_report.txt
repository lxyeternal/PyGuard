{
  "purpose": "The code provides a framework for evaluating segmentation models through sampling, metric calculation, and statistical significance testing, with no external communication or malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Reference annotations input, model predictions, and internal sampling functions",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; all data processing occurs in-memory without network or file I/O",
  "flows": "Samples are generated from reference data, predictions are evaluated, and results are stored internally; no external data flows or system modifications",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; use of fixed seed in random sampling is standard for reproducibility",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard evaluation toolkit for segmentation models, involving sampling, metric calculation, and statistical testing. It uses reproducible random sampling, in-memory data handling, and formatting functions. No external communication, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. The code structure is clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The scores assigned in the provided reports are consistent with the benign and evaluation-focused nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured evaluation utility with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting the benign use of random sampling for reproducibility. All reports' assessments are accurate and justified.",
