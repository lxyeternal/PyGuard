  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the evidence for malware, obfuscation, and overall security risk, and cross-checking the code content.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states that the code is utility functions and data structures with no malicious intent. No external network activity, no secrets, no obfuscation, and no suspicious behaviors are found.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is standard, with no signs of malicious activity. The functions are utility-focused, and no external or harmful behaviors are present.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is standard utility functions with no malicious intent. The only minor concern is the optional import of external modules, which is benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The slight security risk score (0.1) is justified due to the dynamic import of optional modules, which could be replaced maliciously, but this is a common pattern and not inherently malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reasoning aligns with the code. The low security risk score is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report notes the use of dynamic imports, standard utility functions, and no malicious behavior. The only potential concern is the external progress bar module import, but it's benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. No malicious activity, and the security risk is minimal, justified by the optional external dependency.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the benign nature of the code, standard utility functions, no external network activity, and no secrets.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher security risk score (0.2) perhaps due to the use of `random` without seed, but this is typical for sampling. No suspicious behaviors are identified.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scoring seems reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is utility functions with no malicious behavior, no external network, no secrets, and standard practices.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified. The code contains no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2) mainly due to optional dependencies and the use of `random` without seeding, which are benign and common in utility code.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent.\n- **Risk Score:** Considering the optional dependencies, dynamic imports, and standard use of randomness, a **risk score of around 0.1** seems appropriate, slightly above the lowest due to dependency handling but still very low.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Estimate |\n|------------------|----------------|\n| Malware          | 0              |\n| Obfuscated       | 0              |\n| Security Risk    | 0.1            |\n\nThis code is a benign utility module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or significant security risk.",
