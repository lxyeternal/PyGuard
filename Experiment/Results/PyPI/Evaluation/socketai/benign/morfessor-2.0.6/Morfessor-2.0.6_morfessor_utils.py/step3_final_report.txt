{
  "purpose": "Utility functions and data structures for general use, including progress bars, sparse dictionaries, n-gram generation, sampling, and logging, with no malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Reading input sequences, optional module imports (progressbar, backports.functools_lru_cache), environment variables (sys.version_info), and configuration variables (show_progress_bar, GENERATOR_DOT_FREQ).",
  "sinks": "Potential dynamic import of external modules, use of random for sampling, and environment info; no data leaks or external network activity detected.",
  "flows": "Input sequences are processed through functions like ngrams and weighted_sample; optional modules are imported dynamically; progress bars wrap iterators; environment info influences behavior.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic imports for optional modules (progressbar, backports.functools_lru_cache), and use of random without seeding, which are standard in utility code but could be exploited if replaced maliciously.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard utility functions with optional external dependencies and dynamic imports. No network activity, secrets, or backdoors are present. The dynamic import of progressbar and backports modules is typical for optional features. The use of random for sampling is standard, though it lacks explicit seeding, which is common in such contexts. No obfuscation or malicious code patterns are detected. The overall structure and content are benign, with no signs of sabotage or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The low malware score (0), zero obfuscation (0), and minimal security risk (0.1) are appropriate. The slight elevation in risk reflects optional dependencies and use of randomness but does not indicate malicious activity.",
