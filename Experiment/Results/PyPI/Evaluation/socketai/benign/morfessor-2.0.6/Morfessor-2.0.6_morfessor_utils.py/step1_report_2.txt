{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions and data structures for general use within larger software modules, including progress display, sparse data handling, and sequence processing.",
  "sources": "Imports standard libraries (logging, math, random, sys, types), dynamic import of optional modules (progressbar, backports.functools_lru_cache). No external input sources are explicitly read within this code.",
  "sinks": "Uses random.randint for sampling; no direct data sinks that handle untrusted input. No I/O operations, network connections, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Function calls to utilities like weighted_sample, ngrams, and progress bar wrappers do not involve untrusted data flows or external data processing outside the scope of the code's own variables.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed. Use of dynamic import with fallback, standard utility functions, and conditional progress bar logic are normal. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions and classes: a dummy LRU cache, a progress bar decorator with optional module, a sparse dictionary implementation, sequence processing functions, and a weighted sampling method. The code uses safe and standard Python practices, with no evidence of malicious code such as network access, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The presence of optional module imports (progressbar, backports) is benign and standard. No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic were found. Overall, the code appears to serve legitimate utility purposes without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a set of utility functions and classes intended for general use, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It performs standard operations safely and predictably.",
