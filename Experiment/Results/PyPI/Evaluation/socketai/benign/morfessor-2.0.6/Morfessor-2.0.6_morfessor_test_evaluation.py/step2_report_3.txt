  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code is a set of unit tests for the `WilcoxonSignedRank` class from the `morfessor.evaluation` module.\n   - It tests internal methods `_norm_cum_pdf` and `_wilcoxon` with hardcoded data and expected outputs.\n   - The tests are straightforward, mathematical validations, with no external input, network activity, or system modifications.\n   - No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - The code is typical for testing statistical functions, with assertions confirming correctness.\n\n2. **Report Analysis:**\n   - All reports consistently state that the code is standard unit testing code, with no external data sources, sinks, or suspicious behaviors.\n   - They confirm that the code only performs internal validation of mathematical functions.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious code, or malicious intent are detected across all reports.\n   - Confidence levels are high (1), and no obfuscation or malware indicators are present.\n   - No security risks or malicious activities are identified.\n\n3. **Logical and Score Consistency Checks:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable test code.\n   - The security risk score is 0, as expected for internal unit tests with no external interactions.\n   - The purpose and analysis in each report correctly describe the code as legitimate testing code.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n   - The code tests internal methods (prefixed with `_`), which suggests they are intended as private. However, testing private methods isn't inherently malicious; it can be justified for thorough validation.\n   - No external dependencies or data sources are involved.\n   - No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n5. **Final Assessment:**\n   - The code is a standard, well-structured unit test suite for a statistical class.\n   - The reports are accurate and consistent, correctly identifying the benign nature.\n   - No changes to the scores are necessary; all are appropriate given the evidence.\n\n**Summary of my own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code and reports collectively indicate a legitimate, safe unit testing script with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
