  "purpose": "Unit tests for the WilcoxonSignedRank class in the morfessor.evaluation module, used for statistical testing and evaluation.",
  "sources": "Reads hardcoded test data and internally defined functions (_norm_cum_pdf, _wilcoxon). No external input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows within test functions from hardcoded input to assertions, with no external or untrusted data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a test class with setup and multiple test methods for statistical functions. It uses hardcoded test data for validation and internal method calls. No external data input, no system commands, network activity, or file operations detected. The code is standard unittest structure, with no signs of malicious intent or covert behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be straightforward unit tests for statistical functions, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It does not perform any network, file, or system modifications. No anomalies or suspicious activities identified.",
