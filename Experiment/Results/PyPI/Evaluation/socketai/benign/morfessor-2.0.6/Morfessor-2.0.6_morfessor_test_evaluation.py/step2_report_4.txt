  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Purpose**:  \n   The code is a set of unit tests for the `WilcoxonSignedRank` class from the `morfessor.evaluation` module. It tests internal methods like `_norm_cum_pdf` and `_wilcoxon` with hardcoded numerical data, verifying their correctness. The tests are straightforward, mathematical validations, with no external data, network activity, or system modifications.\n\n2. **Source and Sink Analysis**:  \n   - The code only imports standard modules (`unittest`, `itertools`) and the class under test.  \n   - It uses hardcoded data within the test functions.  \n   - No external inputs, outputs, or data flows to external systems are present.  \n   - No file or network operations, environment modifications, or system calls are detected.\n\n3. **Anomalies and Suspicious Patterns**:  \n   - The code is conventional, with no obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs.  \n   - The purpose is solely to validate mathematical correctness of the statistical functions.\n\n4. **Security and Malicious Behavior**:  \n   - The code performs internal testing without external dependencies or side effects.  \n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors are present.  \n   - The functions tested are mathematical/statistical, not related to security-sensitive operations.\n\n5. **Scores and Justification**:  \n   - **Obfuscated**: 0 (no obfuscation detected)  \n   - **Malware**: 0 (no malicious code or payloads)  \n   - **Security Risk**: 0 (no security vulnerabilities or attack vectors)  \n\n   The reports uniformly agree on these points, emphasizing the benign and standard nature of the code.\n\n6. **Potential Discrepancies or Overestimations**:  \n   - All reports assign a security risk of 0, which is justified given the code's purpose.  \n   - The malware score is also 0, consistent with the absence of malicious intent.  \n   - The obfuscated score is 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n\n7. **Overall Assessment**:  \n   - The code is a straightforward, well-structured unit test suite for statistical functions.  \n   - No signs of malicious activity, supply chain attack, or security vulnerabilities are evident.  \n   - The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's content.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:  \n- Based on the detailed analysis, I agree with the reports' assessments.  \n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should all remain at **0**.  \n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**Summary of my own estimates**:  \n- **Malware score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated score**: 0  \n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis code is a legitimate, standard unit testing script with no malicious or security concerns.",
