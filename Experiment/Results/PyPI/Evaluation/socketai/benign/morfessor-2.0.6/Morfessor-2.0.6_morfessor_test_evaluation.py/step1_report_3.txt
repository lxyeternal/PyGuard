{
  "purpose": "Unit testing for the WilcoxonSignedRank class in the morfessor.evaluation module, specifically testing statistical functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from morfessor.evaluation, built-in modules (unittest, itertools), class instantiation, method calls within test functions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed; no output to external systems or network operations.",
  "flows": "Tests invoke internal methods of the WilcoxonSignedRank class with controlled input data, primarily for validation purposes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard unit testing of statistical methods from a specific class, with no signs of malicious intent. The imports and class use are straightforward, testing the correctness of mathematical computations. There are no suspicious data flows, external connections, or hidden functionalities. The code appears solely for validation of statistical functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical unit test suite for a statistical class with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. It is safe to use.",
