  "purpose": "Unit tests for the WilcoxonSignedRank class, validating internal statistical methods with hardcoded data.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded numerical data within test functions, no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data leaks, external outputs, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Internal method calls with predefined data; no external data flow or untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, well-structured test code with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard unittest suite testing internal statistical functions with hardcoded data. It performs no external interactions, network activity, or system modifications. No suspicious or malicious code elements are present. The code's purpose is solely to verify mathematical correctness of the functions. All signals indicate benign, internal testing code without security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit testing suite for statistical functions, with no malicious intent or security concerns. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero, and the confidence in this assessment is high.",
