  "purpose": "Unit testing for the WilcoxonSignedRank statistical test implementation in the morfessor.evaluation module.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'unittest' and 'itertools'; usage of 'WilcoxonSignedRank' class and its methods; test input data within test methods.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communications; no data leaks or external resource manipulations observed.",
  "flows": "Test data is generated and used within the test methods; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated constructs, or suspicious patterns detected. Tests appear standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of unit tests for the WilcoxonSignedRank class, covering methods like _norm_cum_pdf and _wilcoxon with various test inputs. It uses typical testing frameworks and conventional data. No external data inputs, network calls, or system modifications are present. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are observed. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose of verifying statistical function correctness.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard unit testing script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It solely performs statistical method validation within a testing framework.",
