  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is a standard unit test suite for the `WilcoxonSignedRank` class from `morfessor.evaluation`.\n- It tests internal methods `_norm_cum_pdf` and `_wilcoxon` with hardcoded data.\n- The tests check for mathematical correctness of statistical calculations.\n- There are no external data inputs, network activity, file operations, or system modifications.\n- The code appears straightforward, with no obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  No, the code is purely for testing statistical functions, with no malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  None detected. The test data and assertions seem consistent and appropriate for verifying statistical calculations.\n\n- **Scores given in reports:**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated code, and security risk scores as 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  The code does not perform any malicious actions. It only tests mathematical functions with hardcoded data.  \n  **Score: 0** is appropriate.\n\n- **Obfuscated code:**  \n  No obfuscation is present; the code is clear and straightforward.  \n  **Score: 0** is appropriate.\n\n- **Security risk:**  \n  No external inputs, no system modifications, no network activity. The code is safe.  \n  **Score: 0** is appropriate.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \n  No. The code is standard unit testing code.\n\n- **Scores consistency:**  \n  All reports correctly rate the code as benign with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the nature of the code and the reports, I concur with the provided evaluations. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, straightforward unit test suite for statistical functions, with no malicious intent or security issues. The scoring in the reports aligns with the code's characteristics.",
