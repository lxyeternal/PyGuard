  "purpose": "Unit testing for the WilcoxonSignedRank statistical test implementation in the morfessor evaluation module.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'unittest', 'itertools', and 'morfessor.evaluation.WilcoxonSignedRank'. Data used within test cases, including predefined numerical lists.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, network operations, file I/O, or system commands observed.",
  "flows": "N/A – The code performs in-memory computations and assertions without external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscated code, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is straightforward, consisting of unit tests.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard set of unit tests for a statistical test class. It imports necessary modules, defines test cases with setup and multiple test methods, and performs assertions on expected numerical outputs. No external data sources or sinks, nor any code that manipulates environment variables, system resources, or network communications. The focus is on verifying mathematical functions. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical unit testing script for statistical function validation, with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
