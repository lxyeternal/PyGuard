{
  "purpose": "The code defines unit tests for the WilcoxonSignedRank class from the morfessor.evaluation module, testing statistical functions and calculations.",
  "sources": "Imports 'unittest', 'itertools', and 'WilcoxonSignedRank' from 'morfessor.evaluation'. No external input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or system modification actions present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted input or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard testing modules and a specific statistical class. It defines a test class with multiple test methods to validate the statistical functions of the WilcoxonSignedRank class, using hardcoded data and expected outputs. The tests focus on mathematical correctness and do not perform any data collection, network communication, or system modifications. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present. The code solely implements unit tests with predictable data and assertions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate unit testing code for statistical functions, with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or malicious payloads. It only performs internal validation of known functions without external data handling or harmful actions.",
