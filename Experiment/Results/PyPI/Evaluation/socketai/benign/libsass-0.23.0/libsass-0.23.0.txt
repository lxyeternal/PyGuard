The primary risk stems from executing user-supplied functions, which is expected and manageable with proper trust boundaries. The scores reflect a low inherent security risk, appropriate for this type of extension code."

      "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate build configuration with platform-specific adjustments and version management. It does not contain malicious code or backdoors. The primary security concern is the reliance on os.system for executing shell commands, which could be exploited if environment variables are manipulated, but no such exploitation is evident. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, reflecting typical build script risks. Overall, the code appears safe and intended for legitimate use."

The security risk is minimal and primarily related to potential info leakage through error messages, which is acceptable in a development context."
