  "purpose": "The code provides a utility to compile Sass/SCSS files in a directory into CSS files, managing paths and file handling for build automation.",
  "sources": "Filesystem directory listings, filenames, and user-supplied paths; external sass.compile() function for compilation.",
  "sinks": "Writing CSS files to disk, reading source Sass/SCSS files, directory creation.",
  "flows": "Directory traversal to identify source files -> compile() function to generate CSS -> write CSS files to output directory.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or network activity. Use of compile() from a trusted library is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs directory traversal, filters files by suffix, skips partials (files starting with '_'), and compiles Sass/SCSS files into CSS, writing output files accordingly. It manages path resolution and filename transformations with validation. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident; it relies on standard libraries and filesystem operations typical for build tools. The use of compile() is presumed safe; no obfuscation or malicious code is present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's benign, straightforward functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Sass/SCSS build utility with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and justified.",
