  "purpose": "Binding layer providing functions, data types, and utilities for compiling Sass using libsass, supporting custom functions and importers.",
  "sources": "User-supplied parameters, environment data, callback functions (custom functions, importers).",
  "sinks": "Decoding/encoding data, writing CSS and source map files, executing user-defined functions.",
  "flows": "User data flows into compilation functions; custom functions and importers are invoked during compilation; outputs are generated as strings or files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Execution of user-supplied callbacks is standard but could be exploited if malicious functions are provided.",
  "analysis": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured binding for 'libsass' with extensive validation, error handling, and support for user-defined extension points. No malicious code, obfuscation, or sabotage is present. The main security concern is executing untrusted user functions, which is inherent to the design of such extensibility mechanisms. No external network activity or data exfiltration is observed. The code does not contain any hardcoded credentials or suspicious constructs. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk~0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and potential extension points.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, legitimate binding for 'libsass' with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The primary risk stems from executing user-supplied functions, which is expected and manageable with proper trust boundaries. The scores reflect a low inherent security risk, appropriate for this type of extension code.",
