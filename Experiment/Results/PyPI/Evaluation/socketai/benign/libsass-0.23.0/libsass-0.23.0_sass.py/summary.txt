  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, legitimate binding for 'libsass' with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The primary risk stems from executing user-supplied functions, which is expected and manageable with proper trust boundaries. The scores reflect a low inherent security risk, appropriate for this type of extension code."
