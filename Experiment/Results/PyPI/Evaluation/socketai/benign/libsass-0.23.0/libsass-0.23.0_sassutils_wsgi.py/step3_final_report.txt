  "purpose": "WSGI middleware for development that compiles Sass/SCSS files into CSS upon request, embedding error messages for debugging purposes.",
  "sources": "HTTP request PATH_INFO, filesystem files for Sass/SCSS sources, configuration manifests, environment variables.",
  "sinks": "HTTP response with CSS content, error logging via Python's logging module, file reads from filesystem.",
  "flows": "Request intercepts CSS files -> matches prefix -> resolves Sass filename -> compiles Sass -> on error embeds message in CSS -> on success reads compiled CSS file -> returns CSS response.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, CSS string quoting method encodes all characters as Unicode code points, which is safe but unconventional.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a standard development middleware for Sass compilation, with error handling that embeds messages into CSS for debugging. It logs errors and reads files safely. No malicious activity, sabotage, or suspicious patterns are present. The embedding of detailed error messages could leak internal info if used outside development, but this is typical for such tools. The string encoding method is safe but unconventional. Overall, the code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard development middleware for Sass compilation with embedded error reporting. No malicious activity or sabotage detected. The security risk is minimal and primarily related to potential info leakage through error messages, which is acceptable in a development context.",
