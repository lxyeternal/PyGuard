  "purpose": "WSGI middleware for development that compiles Sass/SCSS files into CSS on request, and displays syntax errors visually or in logs.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables ('PATH_INFO'), reads from filesystem (open, os.path.join), logging (logging.getLogger), resource_filename for package directories.",
  "sinks": "Writing CSS response directly via start_response, logging errors, reading files from filesystem.",
  "flows": "Environment 'PATH_INFO' determines if CSS request; if so, it finds matching manifest, compiles Sass, then outputs CSS or error message; error handling logs error and outputs styled error CSS.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. Usage of resource_filename and file operations appears standard. CSS error reporting in comments and :before pseudo-element is for debugging, not malicious. CSS string quoting method is unconventional but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as WSGI middleware that intercepts CSS requests, locates Sass source files based on manifests, compiles them, and returns CSS or styled error messages. Error handling logs compile errors and embeds error details within CSS comments and pseudo-element styles for developer visibility. File reading operations are standard. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The method quote_css_string encodes strings into CSS literals, which is a known technique, not malicious. The code appears focused on development support, with no indications of sabotage or malware behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard development middleware for compiling Sass files into CSS, with appropriate error reporting and logging. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided implementation.",
