  "purpose": "WSGI middleware for development that compiles Sass/SCSS files into CSS on demand, with error display features.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (via environ), reads files from the filesystem (open), accesses package resources (resource_filename), and processes manifest data for Sass compilation.",
  "sinks": "Generates CSS output, including error messages embedded in CSS or CSS pseudo-elements. Calls start_response with appropriate status and headers.",
  "flows": "Requests for .css files trigger lookup in manifest paths; on matching, compile Sass source, handle errors by embedding messages in CSS, or serve compiled CSS from files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. Error handling embeds detailed messages into CSS, which could potentially leak information if errors contain sensitive info. Uses dynamic file reading with open, but standard and safe. The quote_css_string method encodes strings into CSS literals using Unicode code points, which is benign. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a middleware that compiles Sass files into CSS on demand, handling errors by embedding messages into CSS output. It logs errors appropriately. No untrusted input sources appear to be exploited maliciously; file operations are standard. Error messages are embedded into CSS for debugging, which could expose internal details in some cases but is typical for development tools. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or malicious behavior is present. Use of resource_filename and safe file handling indicates standard practices. Overall, the code is well-structured, with no indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as intended for development purposes, compiling Sass files to CSS and displaying errors within CSS. No malicious or sabotage behavior detected. The implementation appears safe and standard, with typical error handling and resource access. Minimal security concerns, primarily related to exposing detailed error messages in development mode.",
