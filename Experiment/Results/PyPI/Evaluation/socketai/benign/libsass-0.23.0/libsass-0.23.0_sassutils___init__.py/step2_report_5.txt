  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of malicious code or malware:**\n   - All reports indicate that the provided code is solely a documentation string (docstring) describing the package and its dependencies.\n   - No executable code, data handling, or external interactions are present.\n   - Malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n2. **Obfuscation:**\n   - All reports confirm the code is straightforward documentation with no obfuscation.\n   - Obfuscated score is 0, which is appropriate.\n\n3. **Security risks:**\n   - Since the code is purely descriptive with no executable logic, data handling, or secrets, the security risk is correctly scored as 0.\n\n4. **Score consistency and reasoning:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the content.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), reflecting the clear understanding that this is just documentation.\n\n5. **Potential issues or assumptions:**\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made, as the code does not contain any executable parts.\n   - The reports correctly identify the lack of malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- The code snippet is benign, purely documentation, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.\n- The scores given are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll reports are accurate, and the package content is safe. The documentation string poses no security threat.",
