  "purpose": "A CLI wrapper around the sass.compile() function for compiling SCSS files with various options.",
  "sources": "Reads input filename, output filename, and command-line options; accesses files for reading and writing CSS and source maps.",
  "sinks": "Writes compiled CSS and source maps to specified files or stdout.",
  "flows": "User supplies filenames and options -> main() parses args -> calls sass.compile() -> outputs CSS and source maps.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads detected. Use of warnings.warn for deprecated options is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI interface for the sass library, handling user options and file I/O. It does not perform network activity, dynamic code execution, or contain hidden payloads. The only potential concern is the use of user-supplied paths without validation, which could be exploited in filesystem manipulation but is typical for CLI tools. No obfuscation or malicious logic is present. The scores assigned in the provided reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with this analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, safe CLI wrapper for sass compilation with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The minimal security risk stems from lack of path validation, but overall, it poses negligible supply chain risk.",
