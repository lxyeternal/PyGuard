{
  "purpose": "Provides a command-line interface for compiling SCSS/Sass files into CSS using the sass library, with options for source maps and output styling.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments, environment variables (via sys.argv), and user input for filenames and options.",
  "sinks": "File writes for CSS output and source maps; error messages printed to stderr.",
  "flows": "User inputs -> argparse parsing -> sass.compile() -> output files or stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or unusual language features. Use of warnings.warn for deprecated options is benign. No suspicious network activity, system manipulation, or malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles CLI argument parsing, validation, and invoking the sass.compile() function for CSS compilation. It manages options for source maps and output styles. All data flows are through user-supplied arguments or files, with output directed to files or stdout. No untrusted code execution or external network communication occurs. The code structure and use of third-party sass library are typical for CLI tools. No anomalies, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate CLI wrapper around the sass library for compiling SCSS files. No malicious activity, sabotage, or security risks are present based on the provided code. It follows standard patterns for CLI tools with no suspicious behavior.",
