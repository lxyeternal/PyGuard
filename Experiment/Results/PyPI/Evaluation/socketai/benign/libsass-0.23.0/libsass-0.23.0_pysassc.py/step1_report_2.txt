{
  "purpose": "Provides a command-line interface for compiling Sass/SCSS files into CSS using the sass library, supporting various options for output style, source maps, and include paths.",
  "sources": "Reads input arguments from sys.argv, reads input SCSS file specified by filename argument, and potentially reads/writes source map and CSS files based on options.",
  "sinks": "Writes compiled CSS and source maps to specified output files; could write to stdout if no output file specified.",
  "flows": "Source input (SCSS filename) flows into sass.compile() for processing; output CSS flows to file or stdout; source map data flows into source map files if enabled.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. Usage of warnings.warn for deprecated option. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads observed.",
  "analysis": "The script mainly functions as a CLI wrapper around the sass.compile() function, parsing command-line options and handling file I/O accordingly. It includes standard argument validation, error handling, and deprecation warnings. No suspicious code, external network calls, or malicious behavior detected. It uses safe file operations and standard library modules. The code appears to be a legitimate CLI tool with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical CLI interface for the sass compiler, with no evidence of malicious or sabotage behavior. It performs expected tasks securely and transparently, with no hidden or suspicious activities.",
