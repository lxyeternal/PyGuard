{
  "purpose": "The script provides a command-line interface for compiling SCSS files into CSS using the sass library, supporting various options for source maps, styles, and include paths.",
  "sources": "Reads input file paths and options from command-line arguments; reads and writes CSS and source map files specified by user input.",
  "sinks": "Writing compiled CSS and source maps to user-specified files; potential exposure if paths are maliciously specified, but no untrusted data directly used in dangerous system calls or network activities.",
  "flows": "Input args -> option parsing -> sass compilation -> file writing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior; standard use of libraries and file I/O. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code parses command-line options to configure the sass compilation process. It uses the 'sass' library for compiling SCSS to CSS, handling source maps and other options securely. Input is taken from command-line arguments, with no external or untrusted network interactions. File outputs are written based on user input, which is a standard pattern but requires safe paths; however, no validation or sanitization of paths is explicitly implemented. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or attempts at data exfiltration. The code is well-structured, uses standard libraries, and does not include any obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate CLI tool for Sass compilation with no evident malicious behavior or security risks. It operates via user-supplied file paths and options, with appropriate exception handling. No malware or malicious intent is apparent.",
