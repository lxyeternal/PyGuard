  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate build configuration with platform-specific adjustments and version management. It does not contain malicious code or backdoors. The primary security concern is the reliance on os.system for executing shell commands, which could be exploited if environment variables are manipulated, but no such exploitation is evident. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, reflecting typical build script risks. Overall, the code appears safe and intended for legitimate use."
