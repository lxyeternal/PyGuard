{
  "purpose": "This code is a test suite for verifying constants in the CoreMediaIO framework, likely used for media hardware control or information retrieval on macOS.",
  "sources": "No user input or external data sources are read. The code imports modules and defines test constants.",
  "sinks": "No data is processed or outputted that could lead to leaks or vulnerabilities. No untrusted data is used.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code simply verifies constant values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns observed. The code is straightforward, using static assignments and assertions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a framework and tests specific constant values against expected four-character codes. The assertions verify the correctness of these constants. There are no dynamic or runtime data manipulations, no external inputs, and no sensitive operations. The structure is simple and standard for unit testing frameworks. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite verifying framework constants. It contains no malware, malicious intent, or security risks.",
