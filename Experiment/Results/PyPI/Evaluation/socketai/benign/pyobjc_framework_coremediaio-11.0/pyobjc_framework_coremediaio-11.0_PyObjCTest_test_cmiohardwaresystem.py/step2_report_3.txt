  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Presence and Functionality**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward unit test verifying predefined constants related to CoreMediaIO hardware properties.\n   - The code imports system modules and asserts that certain four-character codes (FOURCC) match expected values.\n   - No external inputs, data processing, or dynamic behaviors are present.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior and Anomalies**:\n   - None of the reports identify any anomalies, suspicious patterns, or signs of obfuscation.\n   - The code does not contain any hardcoded secrets beyond standard FOURCC codes, nor does it perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications.\n   - The purpose is purely validation of constants, which is typical for system integrity tests.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Security risk: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns or Overestimations**:\n   - Since the code only verifies static constants, there is no reason to assign any higher malware or risk scores.\n   - The detailed reasoning in each report aligns with the code's simplicity and safety.\n\n5. **Final Assessment**:\n   - The code is a standard, safe test suite verifying system constants.\n   - No malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or supply chain risks are evident.\n   - The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe reports are accurate and appropriately cautious. The code is benign, with no indication of malicious intent or security issues.",
