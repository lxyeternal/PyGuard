  "purpose": "Verify that CoreMediaIO framework constants match expected fourcc codes through static assertions.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded constants within the test assertions",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external input; no data leaks or system effects",
  "flows": "Static comparison of predefined constants; no data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward and static, with no suspicious or unusual constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple unit test verifying static constants in the CoreMediaIO framework. It involves no dynamic input, external data, or code execution. The constants are predefined identifiers, and the assertions confirm their correctness. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk near 0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign, static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static unit test verifying constants with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are justified and align with the analysis, indicating a safe and non-malicious piece of code.",
