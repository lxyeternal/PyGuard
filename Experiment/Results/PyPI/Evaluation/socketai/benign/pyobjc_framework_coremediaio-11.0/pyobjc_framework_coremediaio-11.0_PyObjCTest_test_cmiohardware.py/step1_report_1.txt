{
  "purpose": "The code defines test cases to verify constant values in the CoreMediaIO framework, primarily checking error codes and identifiers.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions within the CoreMediaIO module and test assertions that compare these constants.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or user input; the code only verifies predefined constants.",
  "flows": "The code reads constant values from the CoreMediaIO module and compares them to expected hardcoded values; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and performs standard unit tests.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a media framework and a testing support library, then defines a test case class that asserts specific constant values equal expected 'fourcc' values. These constants appear to be predefined error codes and identifiers related to hardware and plugin properties. The assertions are static checks with no dynamic or external input involved. No obfuscated code, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. The code functions solely as a validation suite for constants in a media framework, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard unit test verifying constant values in the CoreMediaIO framework. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code is benign and intended for validation purposes only.",
