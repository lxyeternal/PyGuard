{
  "purpose": "The code tests constants defined in the CoreMediaIO framework related to hardware errors and properties.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; the code defines and asserts constant values.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows detected.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns identified.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a system framework and tests predefined constant values using assertions. All constants are set via the fourcc function with static byte strings, which is standard for defining four-character codes in multimedia APIs. The code does not perform any data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No suspicious behavior, malicious intent, or obfuscated code detected. The code appears to serve as a simple test suite for verifying constants.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward unit test for constants in the CoreMediaIO framework. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data flows, and appears to be legitimate testing code. No security risks or malware detected.",
