  "purpose": "Unit tests for the CoreMediaIO framework bindings, validating constants, structures, and function argument types.",
  "sources": "Constants and functions from the CoreMediaIO module, and the 'fourcc' function for generating identifiers.",
  "sinks": "Function argument type assertions, particularly with function pointers, blocks, and data sizes.",
  "flows": "Test functions verify argument configurations but do not execute any untrusted input or data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of 'assertArgIsIn', 'assertArgIsOut', 'assertArgIsFunction', and 'assertArgIsBlock' for type validation; these are standard for testing bindings.",
  "analysis": "The code is a test suite for the CoreMediaIO framework, focusing on validating constants, structure fields, and function argument types. No data is read from external sources or executed; assertions confirm correct function signatures and constants. The use of 'assertArgIsIn', 'assertArgIsOut', 'assertArgIsFunction', and 'assertArgIsBlock' is typical for binding validation and does not pose security risks. The code does not process untrusted input, nor does it perform network or file operations. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test suite for validating the correct binding of CoreMediaIO framework functions and constants. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The code is well-structured, with no anomalies indicating malicious intent.",
