  "purpose": "Validation of constants, structures, and function signatures for the CoreMediaIO framework in Python, primarily for API correctness testing.",
  "sources": "Reads from framework-defined constants, structures, and function argument annotations; no external or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data flows; validation of internal API signatures and constants.",
  "flows": "N/A; static validation without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward API validation with no suspicious patterns or code anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static checks on constants, structure fields, and function argument types to ensure correct API bindings. It does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute malicious logic. The code is well-structured, clear, and serves as a validation suite for the framework's Python interface.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely as an API validation tool. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal (~0.1), justified by its validation purpose. No further action is necessary.",
