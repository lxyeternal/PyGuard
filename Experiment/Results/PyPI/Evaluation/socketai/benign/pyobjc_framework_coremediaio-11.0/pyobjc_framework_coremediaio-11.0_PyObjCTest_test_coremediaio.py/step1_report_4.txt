  "purpose": "Test class to verify the callable metadata of the CoreMediaIO module.",
  "sources": "Import statements for PyObjCTools.TestSupport and CoreMediaIO modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs detected.",
  "flows": "Import modules -> run test method -> assert callable metadata sanity check.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code structures observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a testing support module and a core media I/O module, then defines a test case class with a single test method that asserts the 'callable metadata is sane' for the imported module. The test appears to validate internal metadata integrity and does not perform any network, file, or environment manipulations. The code follows standard testing practices without suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward unit test for a module's callable metadata, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
