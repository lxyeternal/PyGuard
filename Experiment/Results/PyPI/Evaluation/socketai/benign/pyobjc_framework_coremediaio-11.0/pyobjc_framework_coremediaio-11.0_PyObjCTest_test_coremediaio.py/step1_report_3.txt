  "purpose": "Unit testing for CoreMediaIO module to verify callable metadata integrity",
  "sources": "Import statements for TestCase from PyObjCTools.TestSupport and the CoreMediaIO module",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only performs a test assertion",
  "anomalies": "Use of a testing framework with no malicious behavior; no hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports a testing class and a media IO module, then defines a test case that calls an assertion method. The test appears to verify the 'sane' state of callable metadata for the module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No external data inputs, network activity, or malicious code execution paths are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit test setup for the CoreMediaIO module. It does not contain malicious code or suspicious behavior. It simply verifies metadata integrity within a controlled test environment.",
