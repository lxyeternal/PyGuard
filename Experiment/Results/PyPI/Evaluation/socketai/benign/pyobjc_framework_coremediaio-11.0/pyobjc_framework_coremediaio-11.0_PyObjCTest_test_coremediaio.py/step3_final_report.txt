  "purpose": "Verify the integrity and sanity of callable metadata in the CoreMediaIO module via a unit test.",
  "sources": "Import of TestCase from PyObjCTools.TestSupport, import of CoreMediaIO module",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or interact with external systems",
  "flows": "The test method calls assertCallableMetadataIsSane with CoreMediaIO as input, verifying internal metadata consistency",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected; straightforward test case",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, standard unit test that imports testing support and the CoreMediaIO module, then asserts that its callable metadata is sane. It involves no external data, network activity, or environment manipulation. The code structure is clear, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. All signals indicate benign behavior, and the test's purpose is internal validation. No vulnerabilities, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code's simplicity and the absence of external interactions justify a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0. Confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward unit test verifying internal module metadata. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
