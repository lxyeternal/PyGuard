  "purpose": "Unit test to verify the sanity of callable metadata in the CoreMediaIO module",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'PyObjCTools.TestSupport' and 'CoreMediaIO'",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data sinks or external data outputs",
  "flows": "Importing modules, then calling a test assertion on the module",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing support and a core media I/O module, then defines a test case class with a single test method that asserts the callable metadata of the imported module is sane. There are no inputs, outputs, or external interactions that could be exploited. The code appears to be a straightforward unit test setup with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test case for module validation with no malicious behavior detected. It performs a simple integrity check on the CoreMediaIO module, with no indicators of malware or security risks.",
