{
  "purpose": "The code is a unit test module for the CoreMediaIO library, checking if its callable metadata is sane.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing TestSupport from PyObjCTools and CoreMediaIO",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no network, file, or environment variable use observed",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; test invocation is straightforward",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing utilities and the CoreMediaIO library, then defines a test class with a single test method. The test method calls a function to verify metadata sanity of the CoreMediaIO module. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious system calls. The code is minimal, typical of a standard test suite, and does not include any suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign unit test script for the CoreMediaIO library with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
