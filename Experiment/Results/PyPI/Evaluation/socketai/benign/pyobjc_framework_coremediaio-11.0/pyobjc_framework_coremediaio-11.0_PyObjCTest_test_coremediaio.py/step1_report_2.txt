  "purpose": "Unit test for CoreMediaIO module to verify callable metadata integrity",
  "sources": "Import statements: 'from PyObjCTools.TestSupport import TestCase' and 'import CoreMediaIO'",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no data output, network communication, or data leaks observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; test method calls assertion without external data or untrusted inputs",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns; straightforward unit test code",
  "analysis": "The code imports a testing framework and a media I/O module, then defines a single test case method that checks metadata sanity. The code appears to be a standard unit test setup without obfuscation or malicious constructs. No suspicious behaviors, external data handling, or security concerns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign unit test intended to verify the integrity of callable metadata in the CoreMediaIO module. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
