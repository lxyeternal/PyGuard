{
  "purpose": "This script sets up and configures a Python package that provides wrappers for the CoreMediaIO framework on macOS, facilitating integration with Objective-C frameworks via PyObjC.",
  "sources": "Reads from __file__ to determine its directory, imports modules 'os', 'sys', and 'pyobjc_setup', and uses hardcoded package metadata such as version and package list.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'sys.path.insert' to modify module search paths, and the 'setup' function from 'pyobjc_setup' which manages package installation. No untrusted input handling or data transmission points are present.",
  "flows": "Imports system modules, modifies sys.path, then calls setup() with static configuration data to prepare the package for distribution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. The code appears to be a standard package setup script with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs package setup for a Python extension wrapping a macOS framework. It imports standard modules, modifies the module search path with __file__, and calls setup() with static, well-defined parameters. The code does not handle external input, perform network operations, or execute any dynamic code. It appears to be a typical setup script with no malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate setup script for a Python package providing macOS framework wrappers. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe for use and has a very low likelihood of being malicious.",
