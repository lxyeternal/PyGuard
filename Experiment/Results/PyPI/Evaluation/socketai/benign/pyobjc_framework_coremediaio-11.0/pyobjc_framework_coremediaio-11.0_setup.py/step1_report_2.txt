{
  "purpose": "To set up and configure Python bindings for the CoreMediaIO framework on macOS using PyObjC.",
  "sources": "import os, sys; sys.path.insert; from pyobjc_setup import Extension, setup",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; setup functions for package installation are not inherently insecure.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; mainly configuration and setup commands.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs package setup tasks using standard Python and PyObjC modules. It modifies sys.path, imports setup functions, and defines a setup configuration for a Python package. No input validation, network connections, or data processing occurs that could introduce security risks. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident, and the code aligns with typical package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package that wraps the CoreMediaIO framework on macOS. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The script simply facilitates package installation and configuration without any suspicious activity.",
