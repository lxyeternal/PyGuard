  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the pyobjc-framework-CoreMediaIO on macOS, configuring extension modules and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static configuration parameters, __file__ for path resolution",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data handling present",
  "flows": "N/A; static setup configuration, no data flow or dynamic execution",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with standard structure",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python setup script for packaging a macOS framework binding. It imports standard modules, modifies sys.path, and calls setup() with static parameters. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted input handling is present. The code is clear, well-structured, and follows common patterns. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are detected. All signals indicate benign behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, non-malicious setup configuration for a Python package. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is free from obfuscation. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
