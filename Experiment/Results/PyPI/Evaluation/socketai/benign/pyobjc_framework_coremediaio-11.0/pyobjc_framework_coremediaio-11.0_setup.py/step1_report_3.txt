{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'pyobjc-framework-CoreMediaIO' package, providing macOS framework bindings.",
  "sources": "os, sys modules, and the __file__ attribute for path manipulations; static package setup data.",
  "sinks": "No apparent untrusted data sinks; no user input or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Import statements and package setup flow; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard setup script structure, no obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools and pyobjc. It imports standard modules, modifies sys.path for local package inclusion, defines package metadata, and specifies extension modules. There are no input/output operations involving external or untrusted data, no code execution from untrusted sources, and no suspicious logic or obfuscation. The script appears to be a legitimate package setup file for macOS bindings.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a normal package setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
