  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The script is a standard setup.py for a Python package wrapping the macOS CoreMediaIO framework via PyObjC.\n- It imports standard modules (`os`, `sys`, `pyobjc_setup`), modifies `sys.path` to include the current directory, and calls `setup()` with static configuration data.\n- No user input, network operations, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code.\n- The purpose is to facilitate package installation and framework binding, not to perform any runtime behavior beyond setup.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  No, all reports agree that the code is a straightforward setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No, the code appears correct and standard for a Python extension package setup.\n\n- **Scores assigned by reports:**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  Since the code is purely a setup script with no network, data processing, or dynamic code execution, a malware score of 0 is appropriate. No malicious payloads or behaviors are present.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  The code is clear, straightforward, and uses standard patterns. No obfuscation is detected; scores of 0 are justified.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  The overall security risk is minimal. The code performs only package configuration, with no external inputs or security-sensitive operations. Scores of 0 are appropriate.\n\n### Logical consistency:\n- The reports are consistent in their assessment.\n- The reasoning that the code is benign and standard is sound.\n- No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities that are not supported by the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a typical setup script with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, non-malicious setup script for a Python package wrapping a macOS framework. The reports correctly identify it as safe, with no suspicious behavior or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nNo changes needed. The scores are accurate, and the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n**System conclusion:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis.",
