{
  "purpose": "Set up and configure Python bindings for the CoreMediaIO framework on macOS using PyObjC.",
  "sources": "import os, sys, pyobjc_setup; reading __file__ for directory path; reading setup arguments and module files",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leakage; setup process involves static configuration",
  "flows": "Reading __file__ path -> sys.path insertion -> setup configuration -> extension compilation",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed; the code appears to be standard setup script for a Python package",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, sets the package version, and uses setuptools-like setup with extensions for the PyObjC framework. No user input, network communication, or dynamic code execution is present. The code's structure and content follow typical Python packaging patterns. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package wrapping macOS's CoreMediaIO framework. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, and adheres to standard packaging practices.",
