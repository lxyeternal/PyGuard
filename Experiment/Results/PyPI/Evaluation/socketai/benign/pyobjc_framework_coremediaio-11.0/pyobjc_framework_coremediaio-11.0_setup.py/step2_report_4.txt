  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review & Presence of Issues**  \nAll reports consistently describe the code as a standard setup script for a Python package wrapping the CoreMediaIO framework on macOS. The code imports standard modules (`os`, `sys`, `pyobjc_setup`), modifies `sys.path`, and calls `setup()` with static configuration data.  \n**No issues or malicious behaviors are identified in the code.** The code is straightforward, typical for packaging, and does not handle untrusted input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are thorough and consistent. They correctly identify that the script is a standard package setup script with no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious logic. No logical errors or flawed reasoning are apparent in the summaries.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation & Recommendations**  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** Also 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.  \n- **Security Risk Score:** 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\nSince the code is a typical setup script, these scores seem reasonable and justified.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nNo reason exists to assign higher risk scores. The code does not execute untrusted input, does not perform network operations, and does not contain any suspicious or malicious logic. Therefore, the risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n5. **Malware and Obfuscated Scores**  \nGiven the absence of malicious activity or obfuscation, these scores should remain at 0.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nThe reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign. No claims about vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; all observations are factual.\n\n7. **Score Consistency & Final Estimation**  \nThe scores across reports are consistent and appropriate.  \n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, straightforward setup script for a Python package wrapping the CoreMediaIO framework. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated.\n\n**Final assessment:**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus of the reports.",
