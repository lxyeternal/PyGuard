  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**1. Code verification:**\n\n- The code is a standard setup script for a Python package wrapping the CoreMediaIO framework on macOS.\n- It imports standard modules (`os`, `sys`), modifies `sys.path`, and calls `setup()` with static configuration data.\n- No untrusted input handling, network operations, dynamic code execution, or data transmission points are present.\n- The extension module is built with `-framework CoreMediaIO`, which is standard for macOS framework bindings.\n- The code appears to be a typical package setup script, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code itself is benign and performs a legitimate setup function.\n\n---\n\n**2. Logical flaws or anomalies in the reports:**\n\n- All reports consistently describe the script as a standard setup for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- No report mentions any suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution.\n- The code does not handle external data, user input, or network communication.\n- The use of `__file__` for path determination is standard and safe in this context.\n\n**3. Scores assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, indicating no malware detected. This is consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the benign nature.\n\n**4. Potential issues or assumptions:**\n\n- The reports assume that because the code is a standard setup script, it is safe. This is reasonable.\n- No reports suggest any hidden or malicious behavior.\n- The code does not perform any operations that could be exploited or cause harm.\n\n**5. Recommendations for score adjustments:**\n\n- The scores are consistent and appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**6. Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese scores reflect the benign nature of the script.\n\n---\n\n**7. Additional considerations:**\n\n- Since the code is a standard setup script, there are no signs of malicious intent.\n- The only potential concern would be if the extension modules or the underlying framework were compromised, but that is outside the scope of this script.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The code is a legitimate, standard Python package setup script for macOS framework bindings.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors are present.\n- The scores assigned in all reports are accurate and reasonable.\n\n**My final estimate:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis.",
