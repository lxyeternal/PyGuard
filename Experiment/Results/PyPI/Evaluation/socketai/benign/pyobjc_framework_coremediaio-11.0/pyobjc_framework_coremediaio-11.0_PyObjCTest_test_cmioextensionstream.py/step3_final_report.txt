{
  "purpose": "The code provides test scaffolding and API validation for CoreMediaIO stream extension functionalities, verifying constants, enum types, protocols, and method signatures.",
  "sources": "Class methods, constants, protocol declarations, and static assertions within test classes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; primarily static method signatures and constant checks.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the code only performs static checks and stub method calls.",
  "anomalies": "Stub methods returning static values, typical in testing environments; no suspicious patterns, secrets, or malicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of test classes and helper stubs designed to verify API signatures, constants, and protocols. No data leaks, network activity, or malicious code are present. The stub methods are standard for mock testing. No obfuscation or malicious intent is evident. The minimal security risk score in one report is conservative and justified by the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard API testing suite with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It is intended solely for validation purposes within the system framework.",
