  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code is a set of Python bindings and test scaffolds for CoreMediaIO stream functionalities. It sources data from constants, class methods, and protocol declarations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flows involving untrusted sources or data leaks are present.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The code contains only standard test definitions, stub methods returning static values, and constant assertions. No suspicious code, secrets, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is benign, intended for API testing, with full confidence (1). No obfuscation or malware.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues, no malicious activity. The code is a standard test suite.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on verifying constants, enums, and protocol existence.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data flows or external data handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Standard testing code, no suspicious patterns, no data manipulation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Benign API validation code, high confidence (0.9). No malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; purely testing code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Testing enum types, constants, protocols, and method signatures for CoreMediaIO.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks or malicious data flows.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Standard unit tests, no suspicious constructs, no external data handling.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, standard API tests, full confidence (1).\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious intent or vulnerabilities detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar focus on API testing, verifying method signatures and constants.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flows involving untrusted sources.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Stub methods returning static values, typical for mocks; no suspicious behaviors.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Benign testing code, with a slightly lower confidence (0.9) but still very safe. Security risk score is 0.2, likely due to the stub methods, but not malicious.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious activity; standard test scaffolding.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Testing framework components, verifying API components.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or external data handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No embedded malicious code, secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, standard API validation code, high confidence (0.9).\n\n**Assessment:** No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports describe code that is a set of unit tests and helper classes for verifying API signatures, constants, and protocols within the CoreMediaIO framework.\n- **Malicious Behavior:** None of the reports indicate any malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious data flows.\n- **Obfuscation & Malware:** Zero obfuscation and malware scores across all reports.\n- **Security Risks:** Very low or zero, mainly because the code is testing scaffolding, not operational or data-processing code.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk beyond standard API validation)\n\n**Conclusion:** The entire codebase is a benign, standard set of API tests and interface verifications with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is a safe, standard testing suite for the CoreMediaIO framework's stream extension APIs. No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
