{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a set of Python bindings for interfacing with CoreMediaIO framework's stream functionalities, including helper classes and test cases for constants, protocols, and method signatures.",
  "sources": "Code reads constants, class methods, and protocol declarations within the CoreMediaIO module, as well as test assertions and helper method definitions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data are present. The code primarily defines classes, methods, and constants for testing and interfacing with system APIs.",
  "flows": "There are no evident source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted input or data leaks; the code mainly sets up test scaffolds and method signatures.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only standard test definitions, method signatures, and constant assertions. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code constructs, or anomalous behaviors are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a helper class with stub methods returning static values, typical in testing environments. It includes test cases verifying enum types, constants, protocol existence, and method signatures. There is no evidence of data processing, input handling, or network activity. The code adheres to expected patterns for framework bindings and testing. No malicious behaviors, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation techniques are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign testing scaffold for interfacing with the CoreMediaIO framework, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe and intended for system API testing purposes.",
