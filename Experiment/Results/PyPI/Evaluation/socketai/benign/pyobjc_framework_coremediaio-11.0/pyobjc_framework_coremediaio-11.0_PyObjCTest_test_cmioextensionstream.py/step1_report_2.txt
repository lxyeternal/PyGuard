{
  "purpose": "The code defines test cases for the CoreMediaIO framework, specifically for the CMIOExtensionStream functionality, including helper classes and constant verification.",
  "sources": "The code sources data mainly through method definitions and constant values; no external inputs are explicitly read from user input, files, or network.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data flows into system commands, network operations, or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code primarily consists of static assertions and method signatures used for testing the framework's interface.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard test scaffolding for a framework with no suspicious or unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a helper class with methods returning static values and a test class that verifies enum types, constants, and method signatures for the CoreMediaIO framework. It employs standard testing practices with no dynamic code execution, data handling, or external communication. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful code. All functionalities appear to be for interface verification and testing.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward test suite for the CoreMediaIO framework's stream extension, with no evidence of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated code. It strictly adheres to testing the framework's API and constants without performing any data manipulation or external operations.",
