  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on potential security implications, the correctness of the assessment, and the consistency of the scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a static unit test verifying constants related to CoreMediaIO, with no dynamic input, external data, or network activity.\n- The code uses 'assertEqual' to compare known constants to expected four-character codes generated by 'fourcc'.\n- There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious logic.\n- The purpose appears to be validation of constants, typical in SDK or library testing.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** None. The code is straightforward, static, and does not process untrusted data or perform any operations that could be malicious.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- **In the reports:** No errors or flaws are identified. The logic is sound for a constant verification script.\n\n### Score review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- Since all reports assign a risk of 0, and the code is purely static assertions with no external influence, this is appropriate. No justification is needed for higher scores.\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:\n- The reports correctly identify that there are no dynamic or external data flows, so no vulnerabilities are assumed.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate and thorough in their reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\nGiven the analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is a benign validation script with no security risks.\n\n**Final scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, static unit test verifying constants in the CoreMediaIO framework. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated.",
