{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of constant identifiers for use with CoreMediaIO, primarily to check and set camera and media control properties.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from the CoreMediaIO module, specifically constants and the fourcc function.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data outputs; the code only compares constants and defines identifiers.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing constants and assigning values to ensure they match expected fourcc codes; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behavior detected. The code solely performs constant validation and assignment with no dynamic or external data processing.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a core media library and performs assertions to verify that certain control class IDs match predefined four-character codes. These assertions are static and serve as checks for the correct configuration or environment. The fourcc function encodes four-character strings into numeric identifiers, used to verify control class IDs and property identifiers related to media controls such as brightness, contrast, focus, exposure, and other camera settings. There are no inputs, user data, network activity, or potentially malicious operations. No suspicious or obfuscated code patterns are present; the code appears to be a straightforward validation script.",
  "conclusion": "This script performs static validation of constants related to media control identifiers and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It is likely part of a test suite to verify environment setup or SDK correctness. No evidence of malware, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities detected.",
