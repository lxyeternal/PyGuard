{
  "purpose": "The code defines a series of constant values for use with the CoreMediaIO framework, primarily mapping descriptive identifiers to four-character code identifiers (fourcc). This appears to be for testing or validation purposes.",
  "sources": "Constants are assigned static values; no data input or external data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing endpoints are present; no untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code solely performs static assertions of constant values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code structures are present. The code is a straightforward set of constant assertions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the CoreMediaIO module and uses a testing framework to verify that specific class IDs and property IDs match expected four-character codes. These assertions serve to validate the correctness of constant definitions and mappings within the module. There is no dynamic code execution, data handling, or external input. The code is typical for unit tests or validation scripts, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of assertions validating constants within the CoreMediaIO framework. It does not contain any malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a standard testing script with no suspicious activity.",
