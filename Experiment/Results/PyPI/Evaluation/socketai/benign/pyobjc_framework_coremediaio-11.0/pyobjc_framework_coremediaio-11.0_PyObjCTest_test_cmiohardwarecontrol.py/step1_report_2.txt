{
  "purpose": "The code defines a test suite for verifying constants in the CoreMediaIO framework, specifically control class IDs and property identifiers.",
  "sources": "The code reads from imported modules (CoreMediaIO, TestCase, fourcc). No external input or untrusted data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks are detected. The code does not output or transmit data externally.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is purely for constant verification.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are observed. The use of fourcc codes is consistent with standard practice for defining media-related constants.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a core media I/O module and performs assertions to verify that various control IDs and property identifiers match expected four-character codes. The use of 'fourcc' to generate identifiers is standard in media frameworks. There is no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The code functions as a set of static tests for constants, which poses no security threat. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident in the code content or structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward test suite for verifying constant values in the CoreMediaIO framework. It performs no harmful actions, data leaks, or malicious behaviors. It is safe and standard in its purpose.",
