  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a set of static assertions verifying that constants in the CoreMediaIO module match expected four-character codes generated by 'fourcc'.\n- There is no dynamic code execution, user input, network activity, or data processing.\n- The code does not read untrusted data, write to external sinks, or perform any operations that could be malicious.\n- The use of 'fourcc' is standard in media frameworks for defining identifiers.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or anomalies are present.\n- The purpose appears to be validation or testing of constants, not runtime logic or data handling.\n\n**Malware and Obfuscation Scores:**\n\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which aligns with the static, straightforward nature of the code.\n- The confidence levels are high (1), indicating certainty that the code is benign.\n\n**Risk Scores:**\n\n- All reports assign a security risk of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- The purpose is purely to verify constants, with no indication of security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Potential issues or discrepancies:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- No report suggests any reason to alter the scores or conclusions.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n\n- The code is a static test suite verifying constants, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe reports are thorough and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is benign, static, and intended for validation purposes. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:**\n\n- The code poses no security threat.\n- It is standard practice for SDK or library validation.\n- No evidence supports any malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is safe, clear, and non-malicious.",
