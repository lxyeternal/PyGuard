  "purpose": "Static verification of CoreMediaIO control and property identifiers using fourcc codes.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded constants compared via 'fourcc' function; no external input or data processing.",
  "sinks": "None; no data leaks, external outputs, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assertions without data flow or external influence.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward constant checks with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static assertions to verify that predefined constants match expected four-character codes generated by 'fourcc'. It contains no dynamic code, external data, network activity, or obfuscation. The purpose appears to be validation or testing of media control identifiers within the SDK. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is simple, readable, and static, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static validation script verifying constants in the CoreMediaIO framework. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
