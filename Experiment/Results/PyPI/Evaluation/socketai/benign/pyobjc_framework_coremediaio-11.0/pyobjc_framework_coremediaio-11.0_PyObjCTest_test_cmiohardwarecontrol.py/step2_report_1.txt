  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a set of static assertions verifying constant values related to CoreMediaIO controls and properties.\n- The code only compares known constants to expected four-character codes generated by 'fourcc'.\n- No external data input, network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation is present.\n- The purpose appears to be validation or testing of constants, likely during SDK or environment setup.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code does not process untrusted input or produce outputs that could leak data.\n- The constants are hardcoded and checked against expected values.\n- The use of 'fourcc' is standard in media frameworks for encoding four-character identifiers.\n- The assertions are static and serve as correctness checks.\n\n**Errors or Flaws in the Reports:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. They correctly identify the code as benign, static, and safe.\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are appropriate given the static, validation nature of the code.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- Malware score: 0 is justified; no malicious code or behavior.\n- Obfuscated score: 0 is justified; code is straightforward and readable.\n- Risk score: 0 is justified; no security risks or vulnerabilities are introduced.\n- Confidence: 1, as all evidence points to benign, standard testing code.\n\n**Potential Concerns:**\n- Since all reports agree and the code is purely static assertions, there's no reason to adjust scores.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malware are warranted here.\n\n**Final Estimation:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a standard, safe validation script verifying constants in a media framework. It does not pose any security threat or contain malicious elements.\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate. The code is benign, static, and intended for validation purposes. No changes to the scores are necessary.",
