  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious behavior, logical consistency, and score appropriateness.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script is a standard build setup for PyObjC, involving system info gathering, environment configuration, and testing routines. No suspicious activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis; no malicious activity observed.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — low, given the benign nature.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's assessment appears accurate. The code is typical for a build script, with no malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on environment detection, SDK path resolution, compiler checks, and build configuration. Uses subprocess calls to system utilities like `sw_vers`, `clang`, and `xcrun`. No malicious intent or suspicious activity.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent with the analysis; no malware suspected.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — low, appropriate for a build script.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — no obfuscation observed.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's reasoning is sound. The code is a typical build utility with standard system info collection.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Describes a setup script that manages build, test, and environment setup for PyObjC, using subprocess calls and filesystem reads. No malicious activity or backdoors identified.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — matches the benign assessment.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, fitting for a setup script.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n\n**Conclusion:** The analysis is consistent; the code is a standard setup utility.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, focusing on environment detection, SDK info, and test execution. Uses subprocesses and filesystem reads appropriately. No malicious behavior detected.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the findings.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — low, appropriate.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report correctly identifies the code as legitimate build/setup code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, describes a build/test setup script with environment detection, system info gathering, and test management. No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent with the analysis.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — low, suitable.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment is accurate; the code is standard build/test code.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, correctly reflecting the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, consistent with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly varied but all low (0.1–0.2), appropriate for build scripts.\n\n### Final Overall Estimation:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected or suspected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk:** Approximately 0.1–0.2 — very low, as expected for legitimate build scripts.\n\n**Note:** No evidence suggests any supply chain or malicious compromise in these scripts. They perform standard system interrogation, environment setup, and testing routines typical for macOS Python extension packaging.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:** The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's purpose and behavior. No adjustments needed.",
