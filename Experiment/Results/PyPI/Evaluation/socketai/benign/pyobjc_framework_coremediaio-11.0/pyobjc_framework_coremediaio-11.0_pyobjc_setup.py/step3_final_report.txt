{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup and build configuration script for the PyObjC framework, handling environment detection, compilation flags, testing routines, and package metadata management.",
  "sources": "System commands via subprocess (sw_vers, clang, xcrun), filesystem reads (SDK info, plist files), environment variables, package metadata, dynamic module imports.",
  "sinks": "Execution of system commands for environment info, modification of sys.path and sys.modules, file reads/writes for build info, dynamic import of test modules.",
  "flows": "System info gathered via subprocess influences build flags and SDK versioning; environment variables and filesystem data influence build configuration; test modules are dynamically imported for testing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity; subprocess calls are standard for build scripts; code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical build, configuration, and testing tasks for a Python extension on macOS. It uses subprocess to gather system info, modifies environment and sys.path for build context, and manages test execution. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident, and the code is clear and maintainable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate build and test setup script with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It adheres to standard practices for environment detection and build configuration, with no obfuscation or backdoors. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.2).",
