{
  "purpose": "The code provides setup and build configuration for the PyObjC framework, including packaging, testing, and environment setup.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information via subprocess calls, environment variables, and filesystem checks. It also reads package metadata and configuration data.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data is read from system commands and files, but there are no direct sinks that send data over the network or perform destructive actions.",
  "flows": "System info and SDK details flow from subprocess outputs and filesystem reads; environment variables influence build configurations. No untrusted user input flows into security-critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "There are no apparent anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code performs standard build and package setup tasks with expected functions.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup tasks, including retrieving system info, SDK paths, and configuring build extensions. It uses subprocess calls to obtain system data, which is typical for build scripts. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. It manages dependencies, environment configuration, and testing routines securely. The code does not execute untrusted input, nor does it contain code that could be exploited for remote code execution or data theft.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py script is a typical build configuration script for a Python package and does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It does not include backdoors, hidden malware, or malicious data leaks. All system calls and filesystem interactions are legitimate for build purposes. Overall security risk is very low.",
