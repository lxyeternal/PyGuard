  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, and overall security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Purpose:** Standard build setup for PyObjC.  \n- **Sources:** System info via subprocess, filesystem, package metadata.  \n- **Sinks:** No data exfiltration or network activity; mainly subprocess calls and file reads.  \n- **Flows:** Data flows are typical for build scripts; no untrusted input flows into critical functions.  \n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation.  \n- **Analysis:** The code performs expected build and packaging tasks, using subprocess to gather system info and configure build environment. All interactions are legitimate and typical for such scripts.  \n- **Conclusion:** Very low security risk, no malware detected.  \n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2 (appropriate given the context).\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Purpose:** Build and test setup for macOS Python extensions.  \n- **Sources:** Environment variables, subprocess calls (sw_vers, clang), filesystem.  \n- **Sinks:** Executes system commands, modifies sys.path/modules, reads config files.  \n- **Flows:** Standard environment detection, SDK versioning, and build configuration.  \n- **Anomalies:** Use of subprocess for system info is standard; no suspicious network activity or data leaks.  \n- **Analysis:** The script is a typical build utility, with system info gathering and environment setup. No malicious payloads or obfuscation.  \n- **Conclusion:** No security concerns; very low malware risk.  \n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2 (appropriate).\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Purpose:** Setup configuration for PyObjC, including build, test, environment setup.  \n- **Sources:** Environment variables, subprocess outputs, filesystem.  \n- **Sinks:** System commands, file operations, dynamic module import.  \n- **Flows:** Environment and system info influence build flags; test modules loaded dynamically.  \n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or malicious code; subprocess use is standard.  \n- **Analysis:** Typical build and test setup with system info collection; no malicious activity or obfuscation.  \n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate build script, very low security risk.  \n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.1 (appropriate).\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Purpose:** Package setup, build, testing for PyObjC.  \n- **Sources:** Environment variables, subprocess commands, filesystem.  \n- **Sinks:** Executes system commands, reads/writes files, modifies runtime environment.  \n- **Flows:** Data flows from environment/system commands into build configuration; standard for build scripts.  \n- **Anomalies:** No secrets or backdoors; subprocess calls are typical for environment detection.  \n- **Analysis:** Standard setup.py logic, with no signs of malicious intent.  \n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, with minimal security risk.  \n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2 (appropriate).\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Purpose:** Build/test configuration for PyObjC.  \n- **Sources:** Environment variables, subprocess outputs, filesystem.  \n- **Sinks:** System commands, file operations, environment modifications.  \n- **Flows:** Typical environment detection and build setup; no malicious data flow.  \n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation; subprocess use is standard.  \n- **Analysis:** The script is a typical build/test utility, with no malicious payloads or suspicious behavior.  \n- **Conclusion:** No security issues, very low malware risk.  \n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2 (appropriate).\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, code obfuscation, or backdoors. **Set to 0**.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; code is clear and standard. **Set to 0**.\n- **Risk score:** Given the nature of build scripts, the risk is minimal, but the use of subprocesses and environment info could be slightly sensitive if misused. **Set to 0.1–0.2**.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (low, given the context of build scripts that interact with system info but no malicious intent)\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are consistent with a benign, standard build setup script for a macOS Python extension package. No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security compromise is present.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware and obfuscated scores at 0.  \n- Maintain a low risk score (~0.1–0.2).  \n- The code appears safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
