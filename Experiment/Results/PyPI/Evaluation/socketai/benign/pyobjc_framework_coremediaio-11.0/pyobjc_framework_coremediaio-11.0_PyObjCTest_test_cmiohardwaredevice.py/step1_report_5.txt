{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a test suite for the CoreMediaIO framework, verifying constants, structure fields, and function existence, primarily for validation and correctness.",
  "sources": "The code reads constants, structure definitions, and function references from the CoreMediaIO framework, as well as some imported modules like PyObjCTools and objc.",
  "sinks": "There are no obvious sinks related to untrusted input leading to data leaks or system effects. No network, file, or system command executions are present.",
  "flows": "The code flows from framework imports and constant verification towards structure instantiation and function checks, but does not process external untrusted data or execute potentially dangerous operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious variable names, or unusual code patterns are evident. The code mainly performs assertions to verify constants and structure fields.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured unit test for the CoreMediaIO framework, checking the values of various constants, structure fields, and function presence. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or system modifications. The functions tested are only checked for their existence and do not seem to execute or invoke external data or commands. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are detectable. The code appears safe, intended for validation purposes, with no signs of malicious intent or malware-like behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test suite verifying constants, structures, and functions in the CoreMediaIO framework. It shows no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks. The code is safe and purpose-driven for validation.",
