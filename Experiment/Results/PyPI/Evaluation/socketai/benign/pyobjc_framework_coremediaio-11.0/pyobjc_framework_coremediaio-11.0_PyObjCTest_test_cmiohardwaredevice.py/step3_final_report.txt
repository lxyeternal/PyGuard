{
  "purpose": "The code is a unit test suite verifying constants, structure members, and function signatures of the CoreMediaIO framework, primarily for validation purposes.",
  "sources": "Static constants, structure definitions, and function signatures within the CoreMediaIO module.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data processing; the code does not handle untrusted input or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only performs static assertions and checks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected; the code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static validation of constants, structure default values, and function presence. It does not process untrusted data, execute external commands, or contain obfuscated code. All assertions are on static, predefined values. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard API validation test suite with no malicious intent or security concerns. It is appropriate for supply chain integrity verification of the CoreMediaIO framework.",
