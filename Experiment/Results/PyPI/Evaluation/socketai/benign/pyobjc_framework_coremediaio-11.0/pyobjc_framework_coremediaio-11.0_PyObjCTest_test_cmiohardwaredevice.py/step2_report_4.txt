  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward test suite verifying constants, structures, and function signatures of CoreMediaIO. No external input, data flow, or malicious activity is detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — no risks identified.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code is a standard validation suite with no suspicious elements.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code only verifies constants, structures, and function presence, with no data processing or external interactions.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; the code is a benign test suite.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Also confirms that the code only checks constants and function signatures, with no data flow or external data handling.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — very low, likely due to the nature of the code being a test suite.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior; no malicious intent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code is a benign validation suite, verifying constants, structure defaults, and function availability.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, emphasizing the absence of data processing, external communication, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; the code is a standard, safe validation script.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, and the code shows no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All are 0, indicating the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code as a test suite that only verifies constants, structures, and function signatures without processing untrusted data or executing external commands, a risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n### Final Justification:\nThe code is a standard unit test suite for a system framework. It performs static checks on constants, structures, and function signatures, with no data flow from untrusted sources, no dynamic code execution, and no external interactions. The absence of any suspicious patterns, secrets, or obfuscated code confirms a very low security concern.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the consensus across all reports.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, benign test suite verifying constants, structures, and function signatures in the CoreMediaIO framework. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks.",
