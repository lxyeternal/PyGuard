{
  "purpose": "The code imports a class from the 'drf_queryfields' package, a known open-source library for Django REST Framework query filtering, with no malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself, which reads the 'QueryFieldsMixin' class from the 'drf_queryfields.mixins' module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code only loads a class without executing or processing data.",
  "flows": "The import reads the class into the namespace; no data flow or execution beyond loading occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is a straightforward import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement from a legitimate open-source package. It does not execute code, handle untrusted data, or perform network operations. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are evident. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code. The package 'drf_queryfields' is well-known and trusted within the Django community, further supporting the benign conclusion.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is safe, benign, and poses no security risks. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
