  "purpose": "Importing the QueryFieldsMixin class from the drf_queryfields.mixins module, likely for enhancing API view functionality with query field filtering.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from an external package named drf_queryfields",
  "sinks": "No sinks present in the provided code snippet",
  "flows": "No data flows beyond the import statement, which only loads a class definition",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected in this minimal code snippet",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single import statement importing QueryFieldsMixin from a third-party package. There are no data inputs, outputs, or dynamic code execution. Since this is only an import statement, it cannot be malicious by itself. The package name appears legitimate for a Django REST Framework extension. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or obfuscated patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement loading a class from an external package. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this isolated snippet. The code appears to be a legitimate part of a Python project that uses the drf_queryfields library.",
