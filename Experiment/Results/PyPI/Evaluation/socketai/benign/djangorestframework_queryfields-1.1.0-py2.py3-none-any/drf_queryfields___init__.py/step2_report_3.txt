  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports are based on a single import statement:\n     ```python\n     from drf_queryfields.mixins import QueryFieldsMixin\n     ```\n   - This line is a standard import of a class from an external library.\n   - There are no embedded code executions, data manipulations, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - **Conclusion:** No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious activity are present in this minimal code snippet.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent in their analysis, correctly noting the simplicity and benign nature of the import.\n   - They do not overstate or assume malicious intent beyond the scope of the import statement.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n   - **Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and well-reasoned.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Suggestion:** No changes needed; scores seem reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all scores are 0, no justification for higher risk scores is necessary.\n   - **Conclusion:** No elevated risk scores are justified here.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports.\n   - Correct, as importing a class does not imply malicious behavior.\n   - **Conclusion:** No issues here.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions about malicious intent.\n   - They correctly interpret the import as benign.\n   - **Conclusion:** No unwarranted claims.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a straightforward import statement from a known open-source library used in Django REST Framework projects. It does not execute any code, handle untrusted data, or contain any suspicious patterns. The reports correctly identify this, and the scores reflect the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is safe and standard.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No adjustments to scores or further scrutiny are necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.",
