  "purpose": "Django REST Framework serializer mixin that dynamically filters fields based on query parameters 'fields' and 'fields!', configurable via Django settings.",
  "sources": "Request query parameters 'fields' and 'fields!', retrieved via self.context['request']",
  "sinks": "Modification of self.fields dictionary to include or exclude specified fields",
  "flows": "User supplies include/exclude lists via query parameters -> code splits and processes these lists -> determines fields to drop -> modifies self.fields accordingly",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward filtering logic; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves request context and parameters, handles different DRF versions, and filters serializer fields based on user input. It does not perform validation or sanitization beyond splitting strings, relying on external validation. No signs of malware or obfuscation are present. The potential security concern is data leakage if sensitive fields are not properly managed elsewhere, but this is a known pattern and not inherently malicious. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2-0.3) are consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of dynamic field filtering with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The main security consideration is ensuring proper validation elsewhere to prevent data leaks. The reported scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
