  "purpose": "A Django mixin for filtering serializer fields based on query parameters in API GET requests.",
  "sources": "Request query parameters 'fields' and 'fields!' extracted from 'request.query_params' or 'request.GET'.",
  "sinks": "Modifications to 'self.fields' dictionary, which affects serializer output; potential risk if 'self.fields' is used insecurely elsewhere.",
  "flows": "User provides 'fields' or 'fields!' query parameters -> code retrieves these parameters -> processes field names -> modifies 'self.fields' to include/exclude fields accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Use of settings for parameter names is standard. No obfuscation or hidden code present. Logic is straightforward filtering.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation for dynamic field filtering in a Django REST Framework serializer. It uses request context to access query parameters and manipulates the serializer's fields accordingly. It relies on external settings for parameter names, which adds flexibility but does not introduce malicious behavior. No unsafe or malicious code constructs are present. The modifications to 'self.fields' are typical for serializer field filtering, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. No external network calls, data leaks, or obfuscated code are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate serializer mixin designed for field filtering based on user query parameters. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The implementation appears safe and standard for its purpose.",
