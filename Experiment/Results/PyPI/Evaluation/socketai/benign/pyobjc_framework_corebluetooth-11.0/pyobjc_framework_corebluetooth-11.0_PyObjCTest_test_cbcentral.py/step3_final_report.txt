  "purpose": "Verify the existence and type of the CBCentral class within the CoreBluetooth framework on macOS/iOS.",
  "sources": "Importing CoreBluetooth module, checking for attribute 'CBCentral', and asserting its class type.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, external communication, or data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Attribute existence check and type assertion flow, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple unit test verifying the presence and type of a system framework class. It performs attribute checks conditioned on OS version, with no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The code's purpose is solely to confirm framework class availability, with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward framework verification test with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The current scores are accurate and should remain unchanged.",
