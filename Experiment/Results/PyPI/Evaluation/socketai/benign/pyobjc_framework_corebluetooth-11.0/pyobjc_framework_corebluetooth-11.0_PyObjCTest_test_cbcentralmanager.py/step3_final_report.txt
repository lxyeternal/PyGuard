  "purpose": "Static validation suite verifying CoreBluetooth framework attributes, constants, enums, classes, protocols, and method signatures for compatibility and correctness.",
  "sources": "Assertions and checks on framework constants, enums, class types, protocol existence, and method signatures; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or handle untrusted data or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; purely static assertions and type checks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected; code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static test suite for API validation, involving no data processing, network activity, or external input. It performs assertions on framework constants, class types, protocols, and method signatures. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is solely to verify API correctness and compatibility, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. All signals indicate a benign, standard validation script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as a framework validation suite with no security risks or malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
