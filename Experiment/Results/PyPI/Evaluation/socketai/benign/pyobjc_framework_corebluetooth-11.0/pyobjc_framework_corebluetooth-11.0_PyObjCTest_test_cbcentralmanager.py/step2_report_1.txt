  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward unit test suite verifying framework attributes, constants, enums, classes, protocols, and method signatures.\n- No external data, user input, network communication, or data processing is involved.\n- The code is static, primarily performing assertions and type checks.\n- No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code, with confidence scores of 1.0 or 1, and malware/security risk scores of 0.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code does not contain any sinks or flows that could lead to data leaks or malicious activity.\n- The purpose is solely to verify API correctness and compatibility.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or vulnerabilities based on the provided code and descriptions.\n\n**Assessment of Scores:**\n- The malware scores are correctly set to 0 across all reports, as there's no malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- The security risk scores are 0, given the absence of any security-impacting behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is entirely benign, intended for framework validation.\n- No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Final notes:**\n- The code is a safe, standard API validation suite.\n- No malicious or security concern exists based on the current analysis.\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate; the code is safe, and the scoring reflects that appropriately.",
