  "purpose": "Unit tests for verifying the presence and types of constants and enums in the CoreBluetooth framework on macOS.",
  "sources": "The code reads constant definitions and type assertions from the CoreBluetooth module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from source to sink; primarily type checks and attribute assertions.",
  "anomalies": "All code is standard test assertions; no suspicious or unusual code structures, no hardcoded secrets or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code performs systematic type checks and presence assertions for constants defined in the CoreBluetooth framework, with conditional testing based on OS version. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or covert data exfiltration. The code is typical for framework testing and does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard set of unit tests for framework constants and enum types, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
