{
  "purpose": "This code is a test suite verifying the presence and types of constants and enum values in the CoreBluetooth framework, primarily for SDK validation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported CoreBluetooth constants and enum definitions, and from the OS version checks to determine which constants to verify.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data inputs, network operations, or data leaks; the code only performs static assertions.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing modules, through version-specific assertions, to static type checks of constants, with no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and standard for SDK validation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign test suite that verifies the existence and type of constants related to CoreBluetooth, with conditional checks based on OS versions. It does not process untrusted data, perform network activity, or contain any malicious patterns. The assertions are simple and directly check the type of constants, which are expected to be strings. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code's purpose is purely for validation, and it aligns with typical SDK testing practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard validation script for system constants in the CoreBluetooth framework. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, all consistent with the code's benign nature.",
