{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a set of unit tests for the CoreBluetooth framework in macOS/iOS, specifically testing the peripheral manager functionalities and constants.",
  "sources": "The code reads constant values, class definitions, and delegate method signatures; no external input sources or untrusted data are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or where untrusted input could cause harm or data leakage.",
  "flows": "The code does not process or handle untrusted data, so there are no source-to-sink flows.",
  "anomalies": "The code is purely test-related, using assertions to verify constants and class structures. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are present. No obfuscated code or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard unit test setup for macOS/iOS CoreBluetooth framework, verifying enum types, constants, class existence, protocol conformance, and method signatures. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or system modifications. No malicious code, hidden behavior, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite for the CoreBluetooth framework with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
