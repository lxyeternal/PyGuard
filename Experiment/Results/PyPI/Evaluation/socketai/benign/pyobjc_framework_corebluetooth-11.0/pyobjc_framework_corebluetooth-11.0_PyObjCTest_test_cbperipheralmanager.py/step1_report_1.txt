{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a set of test cases and helper class definitions for testing the CoreBluetooth framework on macOS/iOS platforms, specifically related to peripheral management and L2CAP channels.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input, data sources are limited to framework constants and class methods.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in the code; no data processing or untrusted data output is observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is present; the code primarily checks constants and class methods.",
  "anomalies": "The code is mostly standard test code with no apparent malicious anomalies. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are present. The helper class methods are placeholders with no implementation.",
  "analysis": "The script defines helper classes and performs assertions on constants, enums, class types, protocols, and method signatures related to CoreBluetooth peripheral management. It uses standard testing practices to verify framework constants and class methods. No user input or external data sources are processed. There are no code injection, data leakage, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be a benign test suite intended for ensuring correct framework behavior and compatibility across OS versions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical testing suite for the CoreBluetooth framework, with no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or security risks. It is structured as expected for framework validation and does not contain harmful behaviors.",
