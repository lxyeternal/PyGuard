  "purpose": "Static verification of Bluetooth advertisement data constants in the CoreBluetooth framework.",
  "sources": "Reading predefined constants from the CoreBluetooth module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; only static assertions on constants.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; purely static checks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and platform-specific with no dynamic or suspicious elements.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static assertions on known framework constants, verifying their existence and type. It does not process external input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. All reports agree on its benign nature, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are consistent with the code's purpose and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static unit test verifying constants in the CoreBluetooth framework. It poses no security risks or malicious intent. The current scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and should be maintained.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
