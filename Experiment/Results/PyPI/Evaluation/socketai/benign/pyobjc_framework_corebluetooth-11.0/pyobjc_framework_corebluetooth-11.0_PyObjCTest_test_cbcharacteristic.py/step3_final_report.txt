  "purpose": "Static unit tests verifying enum types, classes, constants, and method signatures within the CoreBluetooth framework to ensure API correctness.",
  "sources": "Framework constants, class definitions, method signatures, and enum types.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input, output, or external data handling.",
  "flows": "None; static assertions verify framework components without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static validation with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static assertions to verify the existence and values of constants, class types, and method signatures in the CoreBluetooth framework. It contains no dynamic code, external data processing, network activity, or obfuscation. The code's purpose is purely to validate framework API correctness. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present. The minimal risk scores assigned in some reports (0.1) are conservative; given the static and benign nature, the appropriate risk score should be 0. Malware and obfuscation scores are correctly assigned as 0, reflecting no malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static API validation test suite with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores in the reports are appropriate; the minor elevated risk scores should be adjusted to zero. Overall, the code poses no threat and is safe for use.",
