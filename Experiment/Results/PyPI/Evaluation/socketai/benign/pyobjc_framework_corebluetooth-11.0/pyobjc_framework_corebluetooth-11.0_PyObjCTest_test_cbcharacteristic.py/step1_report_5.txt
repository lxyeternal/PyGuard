  "purpose": "Unit tests for CoreBluetooth Objective-C classes and constants in a macOS/iOS environment.",
  "sources": "Import statements for CoreBluetooth, objc, and PyObjCTools; test methods accessing class attributes and constants.",
  "sinks": "No evident sink points; no data being sent or received, no untrusted input handling or external communications.",
  "flows": "Test assertions check class types, constants, and method return types; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed. The code is standard test code for system framework classes.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs type assertions, constant value checks, and method result verifications for system Bluetooth classes. It imports system frameworks and testing utilities, then runs a series of straightforward assertions to validate the environment and API behavior. There are no signs of data leakage, malicious activity, or malicious code injection. The code is structured as a unit test suite and contains no network operations, credential handling, or external data processing.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of unit tests for verifying the presence and properties of CoreBluetooth classes and constants on macOS/iOS. It shows no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The overall security risk score is very low.",
