  "purpose": "Unit tests for CoreBluetooth CBUUID constants and class types in a macOS environment.",
  "sources": "Import statements for CoreBluetooth, objc, and TestSupport; class methods that perform assertions on constants and classes.",
  "sinks": "Assertions that verify the type of constants and classes; no data flow or untrusted data sources present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from input to output; tests are static assertions on predefined constants and classes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code solely performs type assertions on static constants and class types from the CoreBluetooth framework. It uses decorators to specify minimum OS levels, which is standard practice. No input handling, network operations, data leakage, or code execution features are present. All operations are read-only assertions, indicating it's a test suite verifying the existence and types of constants and classes. No obfuscation or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward unit test for macOS Bluetooth framework constants and classes. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be safe and standard.",
