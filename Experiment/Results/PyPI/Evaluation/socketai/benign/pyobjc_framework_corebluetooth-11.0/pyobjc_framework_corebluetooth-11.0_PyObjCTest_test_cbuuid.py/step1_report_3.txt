  "purpose": "Unit tests for the CoreBluetooth framework constants and classes to verify their types and availability based on OS versions.",
  "sources": "Import statements for CoreBluetooth, objc, and testing modules; method calls to access constants and classes in the CoreBluetooth framework.",
  "sinks": "Assertions checking the types of constants; no data flows or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Code accesses framework constants and classes, then performs type assertions; no data input or untrusted data flows involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code strictly performs version-based existence checks and type assertions without suspicious patterns or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a test suite verifying the presence and type of various CoreBluetooth constants and classes across different OS versions. It uses standard testing practices with no indication of malicious behavior. No input/output, network activity, or data manipulation occurs beyond type assertions. The code appears to be benign and intended solely for framework validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe test suite for verifying framework constants and classes, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
