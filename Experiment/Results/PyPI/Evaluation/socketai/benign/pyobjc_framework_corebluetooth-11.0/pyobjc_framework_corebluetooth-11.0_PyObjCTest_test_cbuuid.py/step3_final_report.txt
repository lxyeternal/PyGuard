  "purpose": "Verify the existence and types of Bluetooth UUID constants and classes in the CoreBluetooth framework on macOS, primarily for compatibility and correctness testing.",
  "sources": "Static constants and class definitions within the CoreBluetooth module, accessed directly without external input.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or interact with external systems.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code performs static assertions without data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, performing versioned static assertions and class existence checks.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of static unit tests verifying that specific string constants and classes exist within the CoreBluetooth framework, conditioned on OS version. It performs type assertions to ensure constants are strings and that the CBUUID class exists. There is no dynamic code execution, data input, network activity, or data leakage. The code's purpose is to validate framework constants and class presence, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. All signals indicate a benign, standard validation script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward test suite verifying constants and class existence in the CoreBluetooth framework. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriately set to zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
