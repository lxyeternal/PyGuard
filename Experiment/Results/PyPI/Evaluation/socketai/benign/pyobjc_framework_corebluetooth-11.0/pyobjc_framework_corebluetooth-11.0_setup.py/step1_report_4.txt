{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to set up a Python package that provides wrappers for the macOS CoreBluetooth framework using PyObjC.",
  "sources": "Reads the script's own file system to list module dependencies, and uses standard Python modules (os, sys) for environment setup.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is processed or passed to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; setup configuration is static and based on local file system.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or behavior; the code is a standard setup script for a Python extension module with no embedded malicious logic or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a typical setup for a Python extension module, importing standard modules, modifying sys.path, and configuring package metadata and extensions. The module list is dynamically generated from the local 'Modules' directory. No input validation, network operations, or execution of untrusted data occurs. It appears to be a legitimate packaging script without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard package setup script for a Python wrapper of the CoreBluetooth framework with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
