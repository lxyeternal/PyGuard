{
  "purpose": "The script sets up the packaging and distribution for a Python wrapper module for the CoreBluetooth framework on macOS.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current directory to list module dependencies, reads the script's own directory to modify sys.path, and loads setup configurations including package metadata and extension modules.",
  "sinks": "The setup process writes files for package installation; no direct sink for untrusted data or network communication is present.",
  "flows": "The script reads file system data (list of modules), modifies sys.path, and passes configuration data to setup functions which generate installable packages. No untrusted data flows to insecure sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code performs standard package setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script using setuptools for building a Python extension module wrapping a macOS framework. It reads module files from a directory, constructs extension configuration, and calls setup. No input validation, no external network calls, and no suspicious code patterns are present. The purpose is purely to package a Python extension for distribution. The code structure is typical and does not contain obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for packaging a Python extension module. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected. It does not contain suspicious code, backdoors, or data leaks. Overall, it appears safe and legitimate.",
