{
  "purpose": "To set up and package Python bindings (wrappers) for the macOS CoreBluetooth framework using PyObjC.",
  "sources": "os.path.dirname(__file__), os.listdir('Modules'), os.path.join('Modules', fn), __doc__",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; the script primarily configures build parameters and dependencies.",
  "flows": "The script reads the current file path and module directory to determine source files for extension compilation. No untrusted data flows to potentially dangerous operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. The code performs standard setup tasks without obfuscated constructs or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, modifies sys.path, and uses setup functions from pyobjc_setup to configure build parameters for a Python extension module. It dynamically lists module dependencies, which is typical for package setup scripts. There are no signs of malicious code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious network activity. The code is straightforward and appears to be a standard package configuration script for PyObjC wrappers.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate setup script for building Python bindings for the CoreBluetooth framework. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks based on its content and structure.",
