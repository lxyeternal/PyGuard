{
  "purpose": "This code is for setting up a Python package that provides wrappers for the CoreBluetooth framework on macOS, enabling Python programs to interact with Bluetooth functionalities.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current directory for modules, retrieves file list in 'Modules' directory, and imports setup functions from 'pyobjc_setup'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform risky operations are present. The setup process involves file paths and package configuration only.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing setup functions, defining package metadata, collecting module dependencies, and configuring the build process with no untrusted data flow or external input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code performs standard package setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard Python package configuration for a macOS Bluetooth framework wrapper using setuptools and PyObjC. It dynamically constructs dependency lists and extension modules based on directory contents. No external inputs or untrusted data handling is evident. The code does not include network operations, data leakage, or any malicious logic. The logic is straightforward and aligns with typical package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely automates the build process for a framework wrapper without any suspicious or harmful operations.",
