  "purpose": "Build and test setup for PyObjC, gathering system info, configuring build flags, and managing test modules.",
  "sources": "System commands ('sw_vers', 'clang', 'xcrun'), environment variables, filesystem (SDK plist, headers), dynamic import of test modules.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls, file reads/writes, dynamic module imports, sys.path modifications.",
  "flows": "System info and SDK detection influence build flags; test modules are dynamically imported, executing code during testing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or network activity. Dynamic imports could execute arbitrary code if test files are malicious, but this is standard in test environments.",
  "analysis": "The code performs legitimate build and test procedures using subprocesses for system info, environment variables for configuration, and dynamic imports for testing. No malicious payloads, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows are present. The subprocess calls and filesystem interactions are typical for such scripts. Dynamic import of test modules is a common pattern but could execute malicious code if test files are compromised; however, within a controlled environment, this is expected. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and potential environment manipulation risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard build and test setup for macOS Python extensions, with no malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The low risk score appropriately reflects the minimal inherent security concerns associated with subprocess calls and dynamic imports in a trusted build environment.",
