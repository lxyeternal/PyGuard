{
  "purpose": "To provide an interface for interacting with Solarman v5 solar inverter data loggers.",
  "sources": "Imports from the pysolarmanv5 library, which is used to communicate with solar loggers.",
  "sinks": "None evident; the code imports modules and defines an export list, with no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink within this code; it is primarily a module setup with imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module that imports classes and errors from the pysolarmanv5 package and defines a list of exports. There are no apparent source-to-sink data flows or suspicious logic. The purpose is to expose specific classes and errors for external use, with no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module setup that imports and re-exports classes from a legitimate library used for solar inverter communication. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
