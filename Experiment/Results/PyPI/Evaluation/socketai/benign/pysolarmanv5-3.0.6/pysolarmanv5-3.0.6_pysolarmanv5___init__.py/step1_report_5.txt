{
  "purpose": "The code provides a module to interact with Solarman v5 solar inverter data loggers, exporting classes and errors for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the pysolarmanv5 package for synchronous and asynchronous classes and error types.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not handle user input, environment variables, or network data directly.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks within this snippet; it primarily exports imported classes and errors.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated elements are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing specific classes and error types from an external library 'pysolarmanv5' and defining an __all__ list for exports. It includes a descriptive comment about its purpose. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The code appears to be a standard module setup for exposing library components.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module setup intended to expose specific classes and errors from the 'pysolarmanv5' package. There are no indications of malicious intent, suspicious activities, or security risks.",
