{
  "purpose": "This module serves as an interface to the 'pysolarmanv5' library, importing key classes and error types for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'pysolarmanv5.pysolarmanv5' and 'pysolarmanv5.pysolarmanv5_async', defining the '__all__' list.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code only imports and re-exports classes and errors.",
  "flows": "Import statements and the '__all__' list, with no data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports specific classes and error types from an external library and defines an export list. It contains no data processing, network activity, or control flow that could be malicious. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code. There are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The trustworthiness of the external library is outside the scope of this snippet, but the code itself is safe. Overall, the code is a benign interface setup with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module that imports and exposes classes from an external library. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The security risk, malware, and obfuscation scores should all be zero, consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
