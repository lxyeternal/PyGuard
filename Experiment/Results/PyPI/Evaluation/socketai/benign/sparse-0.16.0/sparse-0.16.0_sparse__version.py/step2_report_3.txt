  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward version declaration with static assignments, conditional type hints, and no external data handling. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or dynamic behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports' reasoning:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly interpret the purpose, sources, sinks, and flows, noting that the code is static and benign. No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   All reports assign:\n   - Obfuscated: 0  \n   - Malware: 0  \n   - SecurityRisk: 0  \n   - Confidence: 1\n\n   These scores seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since all reports assign a risk of 0, and the code is purely static, there is no justification for higher risk scores. The code does not perform any runtime operations, external data handling, or dynamic behavior that could pose security threats.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The malware score is 0 in all reports, which is correct. The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior, such as code injection, backdoors, or malicious data processing.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions. They recognize the code as a standard, generated version file with no suspicious elements.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis—no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (to reflect that this is a version declaration, but not entirely risk-free if considered in isolation, though practically it’s benign)\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard, generated version module with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Overall estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (very low, given its benign nature)  \n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's characteristics.",
