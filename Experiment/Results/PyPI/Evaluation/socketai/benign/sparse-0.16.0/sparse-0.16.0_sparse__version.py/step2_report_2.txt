  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n**Overall Code Review:**\n- The code is a generated version metadata module, assigning static version strings and tuples.\n- It contains a standard `TYPE_CHECKING` conditional for type hints.\n- There are no dynamic inputs, external data handling, or runtime behaviors.\n- No obfuscation, no suspicious code patterns, no external dependencies or network calls.\n- The code's sole purpose is to define version information, which is common and benign.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies that the code is static, benign, and standard.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Both scores are 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues here.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Also correctly states that the code is static, with no external data or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk at 0 are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Accurately describes the static assignment and standard use of type hints.\n- **Scores:** Both malware and security risk at 0 are justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Recognizes the code as standard version info with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk at 0 are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Sound.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Correctly notes the straightforward, benign nature.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk at 0 are justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Judgment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and generated, not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** All are 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n**Potential Adjustments:**\n- Given the code's simplicity and the absence of any suspicious behavior, no score adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a standard, generated version declaration module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risk. The scores assigned in all reports are accurate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are consistent with the actual code content. The code is benign, with no security concerns. No changes to the scores are needed.",
