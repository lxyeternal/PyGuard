  "purpose": "Define and manage version information for a Python package generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuples, static definitions, and conditional type checking imports.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points; static assignments only.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and consists of version variable definitions with no dynamic or external data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines version variables for a package, with static assignments and conditional type hints. There are no external data sources, no input handling, no data leakage, and no malicious code or obfuscation. It includes only version info for package management and does not perform any runtime operations that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving only as a version information module. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
