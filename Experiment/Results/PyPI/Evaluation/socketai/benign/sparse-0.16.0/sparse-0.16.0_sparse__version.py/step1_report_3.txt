{
  "purpose": "This code defines versioning information for a Python package, generated by setuptools-scm, used for managing package version metadata.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and version tuple variables, including the version string '0.16.0' and the tuple (0, 16, 0).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, no sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Assignment of static version data to module variables, no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a conditional type-checking block, but it only assigns a type annotation; no suspicious or unusual behavior is present. The comment indicates the code is generated and should not be altered.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines static version information for a package. It sets version strings and tuples explicitly, with no input reading, network communication, or data processing. The presence of TYPE_CHECKING and type hints is standard practice for type annotations. There are no code injections, obfuscated parts, or suspicious constructs. Overall, this is a straightforward version metadata file with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serves only to store version info, and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
