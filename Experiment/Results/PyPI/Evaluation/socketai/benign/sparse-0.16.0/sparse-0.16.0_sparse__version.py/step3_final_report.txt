  "purpose": "Define static version information for the package, including version strings and tuples, generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of version strings and tuples, conditional type hinting block.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external input handled.",
  "flows": "N/A; static data assignments with no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, generated, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, generated version module containing static version strings and tuples, with a conditional for type hints. It does not perform any runtime operations, external data handling, or dynamic code execution. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security-sensitive patterns are present. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and static nature justify these scores, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, generated version declaration module with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent; no modifications are needed.",
