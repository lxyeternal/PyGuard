  "purpose": "Define version information for a Python package using setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version strings and tuples.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or user input handling occurs.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; standard version definition code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical version module generated by setuptools-scm, assigning version strings and tuples. It includes a conditional type checking block that defines a type alias but does not execute at runtime. The actual version information is hardcoded as '0.16.0', which is standard and not suspicious. No external data sources, user input, or network operations are involved. The code does not perform any actions beyond variable assignments and type annotations.",
  "conclusion": "This is standard, benign version information code with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
