  "purpose": "Define version information for a Python package generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version strings and version tuple assignments.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data processing present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks, only static assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded credentials or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code only declares version-related variables, some of which are statically assigned. The presence of TYPE_CHECKING conditional imports and assignments is standard for type hinting purposes. All data are static strings or tuples, with no dynamic or external input involved. No obfuscated code, no suspicious behaviors, and no external data handling are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a benign, standard version declaration for a Python package. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are present.",
