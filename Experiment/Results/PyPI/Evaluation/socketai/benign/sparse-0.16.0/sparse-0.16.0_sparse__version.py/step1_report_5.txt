  "purpose": "Define and initialize version information for a Python package generated by setuptools-scm",
  "sources": "Assignment statements for version variables (__version__, version, __version_tuple__, version_tuple)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; simple variable assignments",
  "flows": "Direct assignments from hardcoded version string to variables",
  "anomalies": "None; no unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets beyond version info, no dynamic execution, no obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining version-related variables with static values. The only dynamic aspect is conditional type checking, which does not involve untrusted input or potentially malicious behavior. The code's purpose is purely to set version info for the package. No sources or sinks involve external data or user input. No anomalies or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and solely responsible for setting package version variables. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
