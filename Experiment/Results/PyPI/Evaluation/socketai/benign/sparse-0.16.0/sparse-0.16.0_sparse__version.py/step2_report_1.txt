  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Presence & Content**: All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward version declaration, with static strings and tuples, generated by setuptools-scm. There are no signs of dynamic behavior, external data handling, or obfuscation.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes**:  \n   - The reports do not mention any errors or mistakes in the code.  \n   - The code structure, including the `TYPE_CHECKING` conditional, is standard practice for type hinting in Python.  \n   - No issues are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation**:  \n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`.  \n   - Given the code's benign nature, these scores are appropriate.  \n   - The `confidence` is 1, which aligns with the clear, standard code.\n\n4. **Risk Justification**:  \n   - Since all reports agree on the benign nature, and the code only defines static version info, there's no reason to assign any higher risk scores.  \n   - The scores seem reasonable and consistent.\n\n5. **Malware & Obfuscation**:  \n   - No suspicious or malicious activity is claimed or evident.  \n   - The code is not obfuscated; it is straightforward.\n\n6. **Potential Vulnerabilities & Assumptions**:  \n   - No claims are made about vulnerabilities based on assumptions.  \n   - The code does not perform any runtime operations that could introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores**:  \n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.  \n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Overall Assessment**:  \n- The code is a standard, generated version module with no malicious intent or security risks.  \n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimate after review**:  \n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious behavior)  \n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (no obfuscation)  \n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion**: The reports are accurate, and the code is benign. No adjustments needed.",
