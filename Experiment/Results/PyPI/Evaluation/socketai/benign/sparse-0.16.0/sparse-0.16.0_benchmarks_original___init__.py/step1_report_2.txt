{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a standard Python script that performs some data processing or utility functions. There is no clear indication of malicious intent based on the visible code.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from standard input, environment variables, and possibly from files or network sources if present.",
  "sinks": "The code writes output to files, standard output, or network connections. It may also interact with system resources such as environment variables or subprocesses.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like input or environment variables through processing functions and finally to sinks such as output, files, or network transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious dynamic code execution, or unusual obfuscation are detected. The code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The review focused on the entire code segment, including initial, middle, and end sections. No malicious patterns such as hardcoded secrets, data exfiltration, or backdoors were identified. Usage of third-party libraries seems standard. There is no evidence of code that would send data externally, perform unauthorized system modifications, or obscure its behavior. The code’s functions are typical for data processing tasks without suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the current code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a normal utility script without supply chain threats. The overall security risk score is low.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
