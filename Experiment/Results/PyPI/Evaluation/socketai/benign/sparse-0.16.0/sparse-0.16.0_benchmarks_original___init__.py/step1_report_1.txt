  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility function, but without specific context or comments, its exact intent is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'input_data' variable, environment variables, and potentially from external modules or files (if imported).",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could potentially reach print statements, logging functions, or network operations if present, but none are explicitly shown here.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources to processing functions, with no clear evidence of sensitive data leaks or malicious payload delivery.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not contain obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated segments, or unusual language features. No hidden or suspicious operations are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code's structure involves basic data manipulation, imports, and function definitions. There are no indications of malicious activities such as network connections, system modifications, or data exfiltration. The absence of such elements suggests this code is benign. However, without more context or external interactions, some uncertainty remains.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be standard utility or processing code with no suspicious patterns.",
