  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Input data, environment variables, network, files, system commands, user input, external modules (as described).",
  "sinks": "Network connections, system commands, file operations, environment variables, output streams.",
  "flows": "From sources such as user input or environment variables to sinks like network or system commands, via processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, suspicious code patterns, or malicious payloads detected in summaries.",
  "analysis": "All reports consistently indicate benign code with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious activity. Scores for malware and obfuscation are zero across reports, aligning with their reasoning. Security risk scores are low (0.2–0.25), reflecting minimal threat. Confidence levels are high where code details are available, moderate when code is absent. The reasoning is sound, and the scores are justified based on the provided descriptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the assessments. No adjustments are necessary unless new code or evidence emerges.",
