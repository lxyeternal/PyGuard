  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script that performs some form of data processing or utility function. There is no explicit indication of malicious intent or behavior from the provided fragment.",
  "sources": "Data sources include input functions or data read operations, such as reading files, environment variables, network responses, or user input. Specific sources are not visible in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network transmissions, file writes, or execution of dynamic code. No such sinks are evident from the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks through variable assignments or function calls. Due to the lack of specific source or sink functions in the code snippet, detailed flow analysis cannot be performed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, unusual code constructs, or obfuscated code are observed. The code structure appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a regular Python script with no signs of obfuscated or suspicious behavior. There are no indications of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code injection. Usage of third-party libraries is not suspicious in itself. Without more context or additional code, there are no apparent security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code seems benign and standard. Confidence is high that this is a safe, normal script.",
