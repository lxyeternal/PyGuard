  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly provided; further analysis of the code content is required to determine its intent.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the user via input functions, environment variables, or network requests. Specific source points need to be identified from the code content.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system commands execution, network communication, file writing, or data leakage points. Exact locations depend on the code details.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (user input, environment variables, network data) to sinks (system commands, network transmission, file outputs). The specific flow paths need to be mapped based on the code.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual aspects may include hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, obfuscated or complex code structures, or unexplained network connections. As the code content is not provided, anomalies cannot be confirmed.",
  "analysis": "Without the specific code provided, a detailed step-by-step analysis cannot be completed. The review should focus on identifying source points, sinks, data flows, and any suspicious or anomalous code patterns such as hardcoded secrets, unnecessary dynamic execution, or suspicious network activity.",
  "conclusion": "Insufficient code data to determine malicious intent. The overall security assessment depends on further detailed review of the actual code content.",
