{
  "purpose": "A simple benchmarking utility that measures execution time of a function, controlled by an environment variable.",
  "sources": "Reads 'CI_MODE' environment variable; executes provided function with arguments.",
  "sinks": "Print statements for output; no data sinks or external communication.",
  "flows": "Executes function once, then repeats over 'iters' iterations if not in CI mode, measuring total time.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, uses standard modules, and performs performance measurement without any external network activity or security-sensitive operations. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present. The environment variable usage is typical for configuration. The code's logic is clear and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard benchmarking utility with no security issues or malicious intent. All signals indicate safety and correctness.",
