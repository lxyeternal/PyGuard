{
  "purpose": "The code provides a benchmarking utility function to measure execution time of a given callable with specified arguments, and optionally skips benchmarking in CI mode.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variable 'CI_MODE' to determine execution mode.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "The environment variable 'CI_MODE' influences whether benchmarking runs; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; code performs straightforward benchmarking logic with no hidden or unusual code segments.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, defines a global flag based on an environment variable, and implements a benchmarking function that executes a target function multiple times, printing execution time unless in CI mode. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activity. The code is clear, well-structured, and lacks any obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign benchmarking utility with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It solely measures function performance based on provided parameters.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0.0,
