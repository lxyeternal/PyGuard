  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet, which is a pytest setup script involving module imports, fixtures, and test collection filtering based on internal backend type attributes.\n- The code is straightforward, with no data processing, network activity, or external input handling.\n- The use of internal attributes (prefixed with underscores) is typical in internal module logic and does not imply malicious intent.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The logic is clearly aimed at managing test execution based on backend configurations.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- **No issues or vulnerabilities are present in the code.** The code performs standard test setup tasks.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in the report's reasoning:\n- **All reports correctly identify the code as standard test setup code.** There are no logical errors or misconceptions about the code's purpose.\n- **No false positives or overestimations are evident.** The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n### Scores assessment:\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.0, which is appropriate.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Security risk score:** Mostly 0 or very low (0.1), which is reasonable given the code's benign nature.\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- Since the code is purely for test configuration, with no malicious activity, **a risk score above 0.5 is unjustified**.\n- The code does not perform any operations that could lead to security vulnerabilities, data leaks, or malicious actions.\n\n### Malware score considerations:\n- **No malware activity is present.** The code does not execute untrusted input, perform network communication, or modify system state maliciously.\n- The malware score should remain at 0.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All reports are consistent with each other and with the code's actual behavior.\n- The slight variation in confidence scores (some 1, some 0.9) is acceptable given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on the code and the reports, the overall security risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should be:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0  \n- **Risk:** 0.0 or very close to zero\n\nThe code is a standard test setup script with no malicious intent or security issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- **No issues or vulnerabilities are present.**\n- **Scores assigned are appropriate and consistent.**\n- **The code does not warrant any higher risk or malware scores.**\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nKeep the malware and obfuscated scores at 0.0, and the overall security risk at 0.0. The reports are accurate in their assessments.",
