{
  "purpose": "The code sets up fixtures and collection ignore rules for pytest, primarily related to sparse matrix operations and backend selection.",
  "sources": "Input data may come from pytest configuration, collection paths, and imported modules such as sparse and numpy.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks; the code influences test collection behavior and imports modules but does not process untrusted input directly.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves reading module imports and collection paths, then conditionally ignoring certain test collections based on backend types.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious function calls, or unusual code patterns are present. The use of sparse and numpy is standard for scientific Python code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard testing and scientific libraries, defines a pytest fixture to add modules to the doctest namespace, and specifies rules to ignore certain test collections based on backend types. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The logic appears straightforward and intended for test configuration purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pytest setup script for scientific testing with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The security risk score is very low.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0.0,
  "malware": 0.0,
