  "purpose": "Configure pytest test collection behavior based on internal backend type attributes of the 'sparse' library.",
  "sources": "Imports 'pathlib', 'pytest', and 'sparse'; accesses internal attributes '_BackendType' and '_BACKEND' of 'sparse'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external systems; internal attribute checks influence test collection but do not process external input.",
  "flows": "Internal attribute checks determine whether certain test modules are skipped; no data flows into external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of internal attributes (_BackendType, _BACKEND) is typical for internal configuration, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and the 'sparse' package, defines a fixture to inject 'np' and 'sparse' into doctest namespace, and a function to skip test collection based on backend type comparisons. There are no network operations, data leaks, code injection, or malicious behaviors. Use of internal attributes is standard for internal configuration checks. The code's purpose is purely to manage test execution, with no security vulnerabilities or obfuscation present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign pytest setup script for managing test collection based on backend configurations. It shows no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are consistent with its functionality.",
