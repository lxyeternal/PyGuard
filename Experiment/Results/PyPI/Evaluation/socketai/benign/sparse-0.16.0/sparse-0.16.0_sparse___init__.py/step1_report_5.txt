  "purpose": "Configure and import the appropriate backend module for sparse array operations based on environment variables and internal logic.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'SPARSE_BACKEND' and internal enum definitions.",
  "sinks": "Conditional import statements that load backend-specific modules dynamically.",
  "flows": "Environment variable check -> Backend determination -> Conditional import of backend modules.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import statements based on environment variables is standard; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic detected. No obfuscated code or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes configuration settings based on an environment variable 'SPARSE_BACKEND'. It warns users about changing backends in development and defaults to the Numba backend if the environment variable is invalid or unset. It performs conditional imports from backend modules accordingly. The logic is straightforward and appears intended for modular backend support. No malicious patterns such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The import statements are standard for Python packages and are conditionally based on well-defined variables and enum states.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical configuration setup for a Python package supporting multiple backends. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malware. The use of environment variables for configuration and conditional imports are standard practices. Overall, the code appears safe and free of security issues.",
