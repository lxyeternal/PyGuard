  "sources": "Environment variable 'SPARSE_BACKEND' and module import statements.",
  "sinks": "Conditional import of backend modules based on validated environment variable.",
  "flows": "Environment variable -> validation against enum -> conditional import of backend modules.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code; controlled dynamic import; benign warnings; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code reads an environment variable to determine which backend to load, issuing warnings if set or invalid. It validates the variable against known enum values to prevent malicious import paths. Imports are conditional and controlled, with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation. Warnings about development features are benign. The dynamic import pattern is typical for plugin systems and is mitigated by validation. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration pattern for backend selection with controlled dynamic imports and validation. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks are detected. The low risk score is appropriate, and the code is safe for use.",
