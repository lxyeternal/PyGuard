  "purpose": "Configure and select the appropriate backend for the sparse library based on environment variables and import corresponding modules.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'SPARSE_BACKEND' for backend selection; os.environ for environment data; imported modules such as sparse.finch_backend, sparse.mlir_backend, or sparse.numba_backend.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic import statements which load entire backend modules; environment variable read that influences code flow.",
  "flows": "Environment variable value influences the choice of backend module to import, which is then dynamically imported based on the backend type.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import with 'from ... import *' can be risky but is common in plugin-based systems; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code reads an environment variable to determine which backend to load, issuing warnings if the environment variable is missing or invalid. It then conditionally imports entire backend modules based on this selection, with fallbacks to defaults. The code uses standard environment handling, warnings, and dynamic imports; no suspicious or malicious behavior detected. The import of entire modules with 'import *' is typical in plugin or backend systems, not inherently malicious. No external network connections or sensitive data handling is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a configuration script that dynamically imports backend modules based on environment variables. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The use of environment variables and dynamic imports is typical for such configuration logic. No malware indicators or security threats detected.",
