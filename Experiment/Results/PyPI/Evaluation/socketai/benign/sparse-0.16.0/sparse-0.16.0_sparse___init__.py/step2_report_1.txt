  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies environment variable handling and module imports.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No direct data sinks; environment variable influences imports.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code patterns; controlled dynamic import.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected; standard configuration code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (low, due to environment handling warnings).\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code is typical for such configuration. The low risk score is appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above; environment variable determines backend.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No direct data sinks; imports based on environment.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior; benign warnings.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity; standard dynamic import based on config.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Well-reasoned; the code is safe. The zero risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar environment variable-based backend selection.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Dynamic import based on environment variable.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation; warnings are benign.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity; standard pattern.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code. The low risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Environment variable controls backend import.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Dynamic import with 'import *' based on environment.\n- **Anomalies:** 'import *' can be risky but is common in plugin systems; no malicious intent.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; standard plugin-like pattern.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is correct. The risk score is appropriate given the context.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Environment variable influences backend modules.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Conditional import based on environment variable.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; standard practice.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is solid; the low risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity, with scores of 0.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.2) in some reports due to warnings about development features and environment variable handling, which is reasonable but not indicative of risk.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 — minimal, mainly due to environment-based configuration and warnings, which are benign.\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 — very low, typical for configuration code.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is standard, safe, and well-behaved. No adjustments to the scores are necessary.",
