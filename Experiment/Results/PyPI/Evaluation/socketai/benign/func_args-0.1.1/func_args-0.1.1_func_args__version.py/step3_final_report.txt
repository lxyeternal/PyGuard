  "purpose": "Define a version string and print it when executed as the main module.",
  "sources": "Assignment of __version__ variable; the __name__ check for main execution.",
  "sinks": "None; no data leaks, network activity, or external input handling.",
  "flows": "Assignment of version string -> print statement upon main execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static assignment and print statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, defining a static version string and printing it if run directly. It contains no external input, data transmission, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The structure is simple and standard for version display scripts. No suspicious patterns or security issues are present. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the benign nature. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the clarity and simplicity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward version display script with no malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
