  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims, scores, and any potential issues.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same or very similar code: a simple script defining a version string and printing it when run directly.\n- The code is straightforward, with no external input, no data transmission, and no suspicious or obfuscated patterns.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- The confidence scores are high (mostly 1), which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Checks:\n\n**Code correctness and presence of issues:**\n- The code is syntactically correct.\n- The logic is simple: define `__version__` and print it if run as main.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, such as code injection, data leaks, or network activity.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- `malware`: 0 across all reports, consistent with benign code.\n- `obfuscated`: 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- `securityRisk`: 0, as the code does not introduce any security risks.\n- `confidence`: 1, justified given the straightforwardness.\n\n---\n\n### Critical review of each report:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All are consistent in their analysis.\n- They correctly identify the purpose, sources, sinks, and flows.\n- They correctly conclude that the code is benign with no malicious intent.\n\n**Potential issues or overestimations:**\n- None detected. The code is trivial, and all assessments are accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:**  \n- Confirmed as 0; no malicious activity.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**  \n- Confirmed as 0; code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Risk score:**  \n- Confirmed as 0; no security risks.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- No need to adjust scores.\n- The confidence levels are appropriate.\n- The reasoning is sound and well-supported.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Estimate |\n|----------------|----------------|\n| Malware        | 0              |\n| Obfuscated     | 0              |\n| Security Risk  | 0              |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard version display script with no security or malicious concerns. All reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways maintain vigilance for more complex code snippets, but in this case, the assessments are correct and comprehensive.",
