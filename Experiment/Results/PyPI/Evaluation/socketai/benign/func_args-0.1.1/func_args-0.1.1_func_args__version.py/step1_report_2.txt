  "sources": "The script reads the special variable __version__ and the built-in __name__.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code simply prints a static version string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version string and prints it if the script is run directly. It does not perform any input/output beyond printing a static value. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activity. The structure and content are straightforward and standard for a version display script.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, straightforward, and has no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
