  "purpose": "Display the version number of the module when executed as a script.",
  "sources": "The variable __version__ is assigned a string value; the if statement checks if the script is run directly.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs the version number to standard output.",
  "flows": "The script flows from the assignment of __version__ to the print statement executed in the main block.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and typical for version display.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version string and prints it when run as a script. There are no external data inputs, no use of untrusted sources, and no suspicious behavior or obfuscated elements. The code appears to serve a simple informational purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior or security risks. It simply outputs a version string when executed directly.",
