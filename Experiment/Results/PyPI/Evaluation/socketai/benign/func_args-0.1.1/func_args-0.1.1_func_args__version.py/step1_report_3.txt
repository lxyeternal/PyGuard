  "purpose": "The code defines a version string and prints it when executed directly.",
  "sources": "The version string __version__ is a source of data; the print statement is a sink that outputs data.",
  "targets": "The print statement outputs the version string to standard output.",
  "flows": "The source __version__ flows into the print function, which outputs it.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is simple and standard for version declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to __version__ and, if executed as the main module, prints this version. No input handling, data leaks, or suspicious behavior are present. The code is straightforward, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serves a basic purpose of version reporting, and contains no malicious or security risks.",
