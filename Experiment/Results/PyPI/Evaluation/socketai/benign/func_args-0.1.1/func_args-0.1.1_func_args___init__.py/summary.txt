  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The silent import failure is a common pattern and does not pose a security threat. The overall security risk is negligible. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and a very low risk score (~0.1) is appropriate due to the silent import handling."
