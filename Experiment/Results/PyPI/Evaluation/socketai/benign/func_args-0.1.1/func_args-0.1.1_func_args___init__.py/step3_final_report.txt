  "purpose": "Import package metadata and optional components (NOTHING, resolve_kwargs) from a sibling module, handling missing modules gracefully.",
  "sources": "Reading module attributes (__version__, __short_description__, etc.) and attempting to import from .args",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external effects; no external communication or data leaks",
  "flows": "Module attributes are set statically; optional import may silently fail but does not affect flow",
  "anomalies": "Silent pass on ImportError could hide issues but is a common pattern for optional dependencies; no malicious anomalies",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining metadata and attempting optional imports with exception handling. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The silent import failure is standard for optional dependencies and does not indicate malicious intent. All signals point to benign, well-structured code. The minimal security risk stems from the silent failure, which could hide issues but is not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The silent import failure is a common pattern and does not pose a security threat. The overall security risk is negligible. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and a very low risk score (~0.1) is appropriate due to the silent import handling.",
