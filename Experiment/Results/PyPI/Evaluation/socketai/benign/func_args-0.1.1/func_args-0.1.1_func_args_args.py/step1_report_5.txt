{
  "purpose": "The function resolve_kwargs is designed to remap and filter keyword arguments based on an optional mapping, potentially used for parameter normalization or transformation.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: _mapper (optional dictionary), and kwargs (additional keyword arguments)",
  "sinks": "None identified; function returns a dictionary after processing input data, with no direct output to external systems or network",
  "flows": "Input kwargs are filtered and remapped using _mapper, with the result returned as a new dictionary; no external data flow or output is present",
  "anomalies": "Use of a sentinel value NOTHING to filter out arguments; no hardcoded credentials, secrets, or malicious code observed; code structure is straightforward and conventional",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that optionally remaps keyword arguments based on a provided dictionary. It filters out arguments with a specific sentinel value (NOTHING). The implementation appears standard, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks. The imported sentinel NOTHING is presumably a special object used for filtering purposes. There are no network calls, file I/O, or external data flows. The code's purpose appears to be data transformation within a larger context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility function for remapping and filtering keyword arguments. No malicious activity, supply chain risks, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code is clean and standard, with no suspicious behavior.",
