{
  "purpose": "The function 'resolve_kwargs' maps keyword arguments to new keys based on an optional mapping dictionary, filtering out values equal to 'NOTHING'.",
  "sources": "The function reads input through 'kwargs' and the optional '_mapper' argument, which are function parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not write or send data to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "Input data in 'kwargs' is processed via the '_mapper' to produce a remapped dictionary, filtering out 'NOTHING' values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hardcoded secrets are detected. The code uses a potentially external 'NOTHING' sentinel, but this is typical for filtering purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a utility function for remapping keyword arguments. It initializes an optional mapping dictionary, filters out any values equal to 'NOTHING', and returns a new dictionary with remapped keys. The code appears straightforward, with no signs of obfuscated logic, malicious behavior, or security risks. It relies on an external 'NOTHING' sentinel, but this is common in sentinel patterns.\n\nNo external data sources, network operations, or data leaks are present. There are no code injection points, no hardcoded credentials, or malicious actions. The function's purpose seems to be to facilitate flexible argument handling in larger codebases.\n\nGiven the simplicity and clarity of the code, there are no indicators of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility function for argument remapping with filtering. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. It appears safe and standard for argument handling tasks.",
