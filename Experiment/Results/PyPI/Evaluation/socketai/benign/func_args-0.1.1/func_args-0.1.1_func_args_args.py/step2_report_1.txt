  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n---\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Function `resolve_kwargs` remaps keyword arguments based on an optional `_mapper` dictionary.\n- It filters out entries where the value equals `NOTHING`.\n- Uses a sentinel `NOTHING` imported from `.sentinel`.\n- The code is straightforward, with no external data flows, network activity, or apparent malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes remapping and filtering.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks or flows.\n- **Anomalies:** Notes import of `NOTHING` from `.sentinel`, which is typical.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Finds no malicious behavior, considers the code safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1, confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Comment:** Accurate; the low security risk score seems appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states function behavior.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data sinks.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Finds no signs of malicious activity, considers safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, confidence = 1.\n\n**Comment:** Consistent and accurate; no issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Similar to previous, emphasizing straightforward remapping, filtering, and safe use of sentinel.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, confidence = 1.\n\n**Comment:** Correct assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Reiterates the function’s purpose and safety.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, confidence = 1.\n\n**Comment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Also describes the function as a simple utility with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Comment:** Consistent with the overall benign assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Issues in Code:**  \n  The code is simple and does not contain any vulnerabilities, malicious code, or obfuscation. The use of a sentinel `NOTHING` is a common pattern.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:**  \n  No evidence of malware or obfuscation. The import from `.sentinel` is standard for sentinel values.\n\n- **Security Risks:**  \n  The assigned security risk scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1). Given the code’s simplicity and lack of external interactions, these seem reasonable.\n\n- **Scores Higher Than 0.5:**  \n  None of the reports assign a score above 0.1 for malware or security risk, which aligns with the benign nature.\n\n- **Potential Assumptions & Claims:**  \n  All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as a utility function for argument handling.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  Since no malicious activity is present, a malware score of **0** is appropriate.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  The code is clear and straightforward; an obfuscated score of **0** is correct.\n\n- **Risk Score:**  \n  The overall security risk is minimal; a score of **0** is justified.\n\n- **Confidence Level:**  \n  High confidence (around 0.9-1) that the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Score Type       | Estimated Value | Justification                                               |\n|------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                 | No malicious code, suspicious patterns, or external threats. |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                 | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation detected.             |\n| Security Risk    | 0                 | No vulnerabilities, data leaks, or external system interactions. |\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent with my analysis. The code is a benign utility function with no security concerns.",
