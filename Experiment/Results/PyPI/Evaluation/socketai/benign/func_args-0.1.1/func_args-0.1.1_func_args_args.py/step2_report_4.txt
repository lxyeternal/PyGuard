  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\nThe function `resolve_kwargs` remaps keyword arguments based on an optional `_mapper` dictionary, filtering out entries where the value equals a sentinel `NOTHING`. It appears to be a straightforward utility for argument handling.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n- The code itself is simple, with no evidence of obfuscation or malicious constructs.\n- The import `from .sentinel import NOTHING` is standard for sentinel pattern; no immediate malicious intent is evident.\n- The function performs filtering and remapping without external data flow, network, or I/O operations.\n- No hardcoded secrets, code injection points, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n### Review of the Reports:\n\n**1-6. Overall Security and Malware Assessment:**\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and performs argument remapping with filtering.\n- They assign very low security risk (`0.1` or `0`) and malware scores (`0`), which seem appropriate given the code's nature.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 to 1), consistent with the benign assessment.\n\n**Potential issues or points of concern:**\n- The only point worth scrutinizing is the `NOTHING` sentinel import. If `NOTHING` were maliciously replaced or manipulated, it could cause unintended behavior. However, based on the description, it is a standard sentinel pattern, and no evidence suggests malicious intent.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or supply chain risks.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring Justification:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 is appropriate. No malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 is appropriate. The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the benign nature, a low score (e.g., 0.1) remains appropriate. The small risk is due to the reliance on an external sentinel, but this is standard practice.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- No changes needed; the scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- Ensure that the `NOTHING` sentinel is imported from a trusted source and not tampered with, but this is outside the scope of the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Estimated malware score:** 0  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Estimated security risk score:** 0.1 (or very close to zero, reflecting minimal risk due to external dependency)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign utility function with no security concerns. The reports' scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's intent and structure.",
