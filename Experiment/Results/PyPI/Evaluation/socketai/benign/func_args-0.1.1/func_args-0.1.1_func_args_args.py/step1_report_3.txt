{
  "purpose": "The function 'resolve_kwargs' remaps keyword arguments based on an optional mapping, filtering out values equal to 'NOTHING'.",
  "sources": "The function reads its keyword arguments (**kwargs) and optionally reads from the '_mapper' dictionary if provided.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the function does not write to external systems or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input keyword arguments are filtered and potentially renamed according to '_mapper', then returned as a new dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that takes optional mapping and variable keyword arguments. It initializes '_mapper' if not provided. It then constructs and returns a dictionary where keys are either mapped from '_mapper' or original, filtering out entries with value 'NOTHING'. The use of 'NOTHING' suggests a sentinel value imported from elsewhere, possibly to exclude certain arguments. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues. The code is straightforward and appears safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple remapping of keyword arguments with filtering, without any malicious intent or security risks. It is a benign utility function.",
