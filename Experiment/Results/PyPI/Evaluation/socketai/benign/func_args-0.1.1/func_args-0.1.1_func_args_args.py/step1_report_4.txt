{
  "purpose": "The function resolve_kwargs is designed to remap keyword arguments based on an optional mapping dictionary, returning a new dictionary with possibly renamed keys, excluding any values equal to NOTHING.",
  "sources": "Input data from **kwargs, which are user-supplied keyword arguments.",
  "sinks": "The returned dictionary; no direct sink for untrusted data leading to external effects is evident.",
  "flows": "kwargs -> filtering with values != NOTHING -> remapping keys via _mapper.get() -> output dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. No external network or system access. The import from .sentinel.NOTHING suggests a sentinel value used to filter out certain kwargs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to remap keyword arguments according to an optional mapping. It safely handles None for the mapping and excludes kwargs with values equal to a sentinel value 'NOTHING'. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or external system interactions. The logic appears standard and benign. The use of a sentinel for filtering is common and not suspicious. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for remapping keyword arguments with filtering. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is standard and secure for its purpose.",
