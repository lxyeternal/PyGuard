{
  "purpose": "A utility function that remaps keyword arguments based on an optional mapping dictionary and filters out entries where the value equals a sentinel 'NOTHING'.",
  "sources": "The function reads input from the 'kwargs' dictionary and the optional '_mapper' dictionary.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or data leaks; the function processes data internally without external output or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input 'kwargs' is filtered and remapped based on '_mapper', with no external flows or side effects.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a sentinel 'NOTHING' imported from '.sentinel' is standard; no suspicious or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility that remaps and filters keyword arguments. It initializes '_mapper' if None, then constructs a new dictionary by remapping keys using '_mapper' and excluding entries where the value equals 'NOTHING'. There are no external data flows, network activity, or malicious constructs. The import of 'NOTHING' from '.sentinel' is a common pattern for sentinel values. The code is clear, simple, and free of obfuscation or malicious intent. No vulnerabilities, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility function with no malicious behavior or security risks. The use of 'NOTHING' as a sentinel is typical and not suspicious. All reports' assessments are consistent with this analysis, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0), which are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of external interactions.",
