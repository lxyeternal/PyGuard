  "purpose": "Define a Podcast class inheriting from Base, configuring API endpoints and request parameters for podcast data retrieval.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to __init__ (country, app_name, app_id), class variables (_landing_host, _request_host, _landing_path, _request_path, _request_params).",
  "sinks": "Super constructor call, setting self._request_params.",
  "flows": "Initialization parameters flow into superclass __init__, and request parameters are set for subsequent use.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual logic. The URL components are configurable and appear standard for API access.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for accessing podcast data from Apple Podcasts APIs. It sets static URL parts and request parameters, with no user input used directly in insecure operations. No data is read from untrusted sources, and no data leakage or malicious activity is apparent. The class relies on external parameters passed during instantiation, which are used to construct requests. The code appears to be a straightforward API client class with no obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard class definition for API interaction with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain hardcoded secrets or suspicious code segments. Overall, it appears safe.",
