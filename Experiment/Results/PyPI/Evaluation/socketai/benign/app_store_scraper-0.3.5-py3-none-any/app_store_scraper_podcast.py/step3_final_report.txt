  "purpose": "Defines a Podcast class inheriting from Base, setting static API endpoints and request parameters for podcast reviews.",
  "sources": "Static URL components, class attributes, and fixed request parameters within __init__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or user input; no data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Initialization of static URLs and parameters; no dynamic data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "Logger is instantiated but not used; no obfuscation, no secrets, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API client setup with static configuration, no user input processing, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior. The security risk is minimal, with no signs of vulnerabilities or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The static configuration and lack of dynamic or insecure operations justify a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1). The reports' assessments are accurate and do not require adjustments.",
