  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The static configuration and lack of dynamic or insecure operations justify a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1). The reports' assessments are accurate and do not require adjustments."
