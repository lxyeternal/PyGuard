  "purpose": "Define a Podcast class for interacting with Apple Podcasts API endpoints, extending a base class.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in __init__ (country, app_name, app_id), class attributes, logging setup",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data is used directly in sensitive operations or external communications",
  "flows": "Constructor parameters -> super().__init__ -> self._request_params assignment",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a Podcast class, setting API endpoint URLs and request parameters. It inherits from a base class and configures logging. The code only assigns static strings and simple parameters without dynamic code execution, eval, or unsafe operations. No user input is directly used in sensitive actions, and there are no network connections or data exfiltration mechanisms present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward class definition for API interaction with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
