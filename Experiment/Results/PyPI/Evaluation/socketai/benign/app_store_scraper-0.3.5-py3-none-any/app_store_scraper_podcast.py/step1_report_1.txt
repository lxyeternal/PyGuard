  "purpose": "Define a Podcast class inheriting from Base, setting up API endpoints and request parameters for podcast reviews.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to __init__ (country, app_name, app_id), internal class variables (_landing_host, _request_host, _landing_path, _request_path, _request_params).",
  "sinks": "Super constructor call, setting of _request_params, logger setup (though not used), and internal variable assignments.",
  "flows": "Initialization parameters flow into super().__init__, which may use or process them further. _request_params are set with static and instance values.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic or suspicious data handling, no use of environment variables or insecure operations observed.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a class for handling podcast review data, with API host URLs and request parameters. It inherits from Base, likely a framework class. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code uses standard logging setup, but the logger is not actively used in this snippet. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation patterns are present. The parameters are static or derived from input, with no evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward, benign implementation of a class for API interactions related to podcasts. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident.",
