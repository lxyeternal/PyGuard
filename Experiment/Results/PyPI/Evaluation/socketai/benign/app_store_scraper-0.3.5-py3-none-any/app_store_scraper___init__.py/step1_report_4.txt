{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports specific classes and version metadata for a package, and defines what is exported.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: .app_store, .podcast, and .__version__",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no untrusted data handling, external communication, or sensitive data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code mainly imports and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and contains no suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes and version info from internal modules, then specifies what is available publicly via __all__. There are no data inputs, no processing, and no external communication. All operations are standard for a Python package's __init__.py or main module, focusing on organizing exports.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical package initialization file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely organizes imports and exports for a Python package.",
