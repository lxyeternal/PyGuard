{
  "purpose": "The code defines module imports and exports for a Python package, specifically importing from local modules and exposing certain components.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .app_store, .podcast, and .__version__",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points are present; the code only performs imports and defines __all__",
  "flows": "Data flows from imported modules to the module namespace; no external data or untrusted inputs are processed",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code constructs; the code is straightforward and standard for package initialization",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and version information from local modules and exposes AppStore and Podcast in __all__. There are no dynamic code executions, no input handling, and no data leaks. The import statements are from relative local modules, which is typical for package structure. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard package setup code with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply imports and exposes components for package usage.",
