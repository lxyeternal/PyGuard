{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an __init__.py file that exposes specific classes and metadata for a Python package.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .app_store, .podcast, .__version__",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code only imports modules and defines __all__",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; just static imports and module exports",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes and metadata from local modules, then exposes certain classes and variables via __all__. It is a typical package __init__.py structure. No data input handling, no network calls, and no dynamic code execution are present. The code does not perform any operations that could introduce security risks or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard package initialization file with no signs of malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation.",
