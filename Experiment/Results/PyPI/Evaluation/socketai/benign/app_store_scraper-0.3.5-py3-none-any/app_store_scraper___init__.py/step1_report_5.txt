{
  "purpose": "Define public interface for the package by importing specific classes and metadata.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .app_store, .podcast, and .__version__",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling points; purely defining exports and metadata",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only module imports and export declarations",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code present",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes 'AppStore' and 'Podcast' from local modules and version/metadata information from __version__. It then declares __all__ to specify public API exports. All operations are standard module setup procedures with no data processing, user input, or external communication. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module initialization script that exports classes and metadata without any suspicious or malicious activity.",
