  "purpose": "Standard package initialization code importing local modules and exposing specific classes and version info.",
  "sources": "Imports from .app_store, .podcast, and .__version__ modules",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external communication or data handling",
  "flows": "Import statements and exposure via __all__ without dynamic or external data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and export statements, no obfuscation or malicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical __init__.py for a Python package, importing classes and version metadata from local modules and exposing selected components via __all__. It contains no dynamic code execution, network calls, or data processing. All reports correctly identify it as standard package setup code with no suspicious behavior. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and clarity confirm its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initialization module with no malicious or security concerns. The current scores accurately reflect its security posture. No adjustments are necessary.",
