  "purpose": "This code module appears to be a part of a package's __init__.py file, importing and exposing classes and version information for use in the package.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .app_store, .podcast, and .__version__",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no external network, file, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; primarily static imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code follows standard Python package initialization patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes and version metadata from local modules and exposes them via __all__. No user input, external data, or dangerous functions are used. The code is minimal, straightforward, and typical for package initialization files. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard package setup code with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It simply exposes certain modules and version info for external use.",
