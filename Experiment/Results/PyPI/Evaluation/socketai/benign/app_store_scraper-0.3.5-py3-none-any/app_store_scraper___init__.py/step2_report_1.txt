  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Report 1**  \n   - **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is straightforward package setup code, importing local modules and exposing certain components via `__all__`.  \n   - **Malware, Obfuscated, Risk Scores:** All scores are 0, which aligns with the analysis.  \n   - **Conclusion:** No issues here. The report is accurate.\n\n2. **Report 2**  \n   - **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it correctly states that the code is a standard `__init__.py` with no suspicious behavior.  \n   - **Scores:** All zeros, which are appropriate.  \n   - **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n3. **Report 3**  \n   - **Assessment:** Again, the analysis confirms that this is typical package initialization code with no malicious intent.  \n   - **Scores:** All zeros, matching the assessment.  \n   - **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n4. **Report 4**  \n   - **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports; standard import/export code with no anomalies.  \n   - **Scores:** All zeros.  \n   - **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n5. **Report 5**  \n   - **Assessment:** Same as above; standard package setup code, no suspicious activity.  \n   - **Scores:** All zeros.  \n   - **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code presence:** The code is purely standard package initialization code, importing from local modules and exposing components.\n- **Malicious or suspicious activity:** None detected. No dynamic code, no external data handling, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and risk scores as 0, which is consistent with the code content.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious or risky.\n- The structure is typical for Python package `__init__.py` files.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malware, or security vulnerabilities are present.\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Note:** Given the simplicity and standard nature of this code, I agree with the current scores. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nThe report accurately reflects the security posture of this code. It is safe, clear, and free of malicious or obfuscated content.",
