  "purpose": "Define metadata attributes for the 'app-store-scraper' Python package, including title, version, description, author, URL, license, and keywords.",
  "sources": "None; all are static string assignments or list definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or untrusted input handling present.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow or input processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments defining package metadata. There are no input sources, no data processing, no external data retrieval, and no execution of code that could be malicious. All variables are assigned static strings or lists, which are typical for package metadata. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard package metadata with no malicious intent or security concerns. It simply declares descriptive information about the package. No suspicious activity or security risks are identified.",
