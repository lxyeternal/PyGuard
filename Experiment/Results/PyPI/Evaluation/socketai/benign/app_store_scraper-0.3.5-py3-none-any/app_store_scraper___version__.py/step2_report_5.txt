  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the code snippet carefully.\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code consists solely of static variable assignments defining package metadata:\n     ```python\n     __title__ = \"app-store-scraper\"\n     __version__ = \"0.3.5\"\n     __description__ = \"Single API ☝ App Store Review Scraper 🧹\"\n     __author__ = \"Eric Lim\"\n     __url__ = \"https://github.com/cowboy-bebug/app-store-scraper\"\n     __license__ = \"MIT\"\n     __keywords__ = [\n         \"app store\",\n         \"ios\",\n         \"ios apps\",\n         \"podcasts\",\n         \"review\",\n         \"scraping\",\n         \"scraper\",\n     ]\n     ```\n   - No dynamic code, no input handling, no external data processing, no network calls, no code obfuscation, and no malicious payloads are present.\n\n2. **Assessment of the Reports:**\n   - All five reports agree that the code is straightforward metadata with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - They correctly identify that there are no data flows, sinks, or sources, and that the code is static.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the static, metadata-only code.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns or Misinterpretations:**\n   - The only point to consider is whether any of the metadata or code could be malicious or suspicious. Given the content, this is not the case.\n   - The URL points to a GitHub repository, which appears to be a legitimate project for scraping app store reviews.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n   - The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- **Malware Score:** Keep at 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Keep at 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Keep at 0.\n- **Confidence Level:** 1 (high confidence in the benign nature).\n\n**Overall, I agree with the assessments provided.** There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risk in this code snippet.",
