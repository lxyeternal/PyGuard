  "purpose": "Define metadata for the app-store-scraper Python package, including version, description, author, URL, license, and keywords.",
  "sources": "None (all are metadata variables assigned string or list values)",
  "sinks": "None (no data is processed or output; no untrusted data handling or security-sensitive operations present)",
  "flows": "None (no data flow or source-to-sink pathways, as this is purely metadata assignment)",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code consists solely of metadata variable definitions with string and list literals.",
  "analysis": "The code declares module-level variables containing package metadata such as title, version, description, author, URL, license, and keywords. All variables are assigned static string or list literals, with no input processing, dynamic code execution, or external data handling observed. There are no signs of malicious logic, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a straightforward declaration of package metadata with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be standard setup information for a Python package.",
