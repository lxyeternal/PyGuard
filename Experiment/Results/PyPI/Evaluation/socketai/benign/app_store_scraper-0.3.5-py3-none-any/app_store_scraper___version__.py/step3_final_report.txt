  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the app-store-scraper Python package.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments for __title__, __version__, __description__, __author__, __url__, __license__, and __keywords__.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input, output, or external interactions.",
  "flows": "N/A; static metadata without data flow or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static metadata declarations with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments defining package metadata. There are no functions, data processing, external data fetching, or dynamic code execution. All reports correctly identify this as benign, metadata-only code. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code content. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected. The code is typical for a setup or module info file in Python packages, with no external interactions or dynamic elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static package metadata declaration with no security concerns or malicious intent. All reports are accurate, and the current scores are appropriate. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
