  "purpose": "Define package metadata for a Python package named 'app-store-scraper' which is intended to scrape app store reviews.",
  "sources": "The code sources include the assignment of metadata variables (__title__, __version__, __description__, __author__, __url__, __license__, __keywords__).",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks present in this snippet; no data is being processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only assigns static metadata values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are present. The code is straightforward metadata assignment.",
  "analysis": "This code only defines string variables containing package metadata such as title, version, description, author, URL, license, and keywords. No input, no data processing, and no external interactions occur. The content is static and standard for Python package setup files. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely declarative metadata for a Python package with no malicious or suspicious elements. It poses no security risk and does not exhibit malware or obfuscation. It is a benign setup-related snippet.",
