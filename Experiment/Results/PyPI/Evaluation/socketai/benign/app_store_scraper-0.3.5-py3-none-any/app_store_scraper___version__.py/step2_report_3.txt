  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the code snippet carefully.\n\n**Code Content Review:**\nThe code snippet is a straightforward set of variable assignments defining package metadata:\n```python\n__title__ = \"app-store-scraper\"\n__version__ = \"0.3.5\"\n__description__ = \"Single API ☝ App Store Review Scraper 🧹\"\n__author__ = \"Eric Lim\"\n__url__ = \"https://github.com/cowboy-bebug/app-store-scraper\"\n__license__ = \"MIT\"\n__keywords__ = [\n    \"app store\",\n    \"ios\",\n    \"ios apps\",\n    \"podcasts\",\n    \"review\",\n    \"scraping\",\n    \"scraper\",\n]\n```\nThis is typical for a setup or module metadata file. No dynamic code, no input/output, no external data fetching, and no obfuscated or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n---\n\n### Review of the Reports:\n\n**Consensus:**\n- All reports agree that the code is purely metadata, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The confidence levels are high (1), and no anomalies are detected.\n- Malware scores are all zero, indicating no malicious behavior.\n\n**Potential Issues or Discrepancies:**\n- None. All reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  No. The code is benign metadata assignment.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning?**  \n  No. The reasoning is sound and aligns with the code content.\n\n- **Scores assigned to each issue?**  \n  The malware score is 0 in all reports, which is appropriate given the benign nature. The security risk score is also 0, which is correct.\n\n- **Is the risk score higher than 0.5 justified?**  \n  No. Since there's no malicious or suspicious activity, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n- **Malware score justification:**  \n  The malware score is 0 across all reports, correctly reflecting the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. All assessments are based on observable static code, with no assumptions about hidden behavior.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the code and the assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\nGiven the static, straightforward nature of the code and the unanimous agreement among reports, I concur with the current assessments.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign, non-malicious, and non-obfuscated nature of the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is purely metadata with no security risks or malicious intent. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nAccept the current assessments; no changes needed.",
