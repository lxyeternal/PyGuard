  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: presence of malicious behavior, correctness of scores, and consistency.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Defines an `AppStore` class inheriting from `Base`.\n- Sets static hostnames and URL paths.\n- Initializes request parameters with some static values.\n- Uses constructor parameters (`country`, `app_name`, `app_id`) to build URL paths and request parameters.\n- No network calls or data processing shown in this snippet.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code.\n- No suspicious patterns or malicious behavior apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Purpose:** Standard class for fetching app reviews.\n- **Findings:** No untrusted data flows, no suspicious code, no malware.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code appears safe and straightforward.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable; no change needed.\n\n#### Report 2:\n- **Purpose:** Similar to above, API interaction for reviews.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1, Confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code; no issues.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n#### Report 3:\n- **Purpose:** API wrapper for App Store reviews.\n- **Findings:** Static hostnames and paths, no suspicious logic.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious intent or vulnerabilities evident.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n#### Report 4:\n- **Purpose:** Similar API client setup.\n- **Findings:** No secrets, no obfuscation, benign code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** No issues detected.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n#### Report 5:\n- **Purpose:** API class for fetching reviews.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, no secrets, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward and safe.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### General observations:\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The security risk scores are low (around 0.1–0.2), which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n- Malware scores are all zero, correctly reflecting the absence of malicious behavior.\n- Confidence levels are high (0.9), consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct; no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct; code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (reasonable, considering the code interacts with external services but does not process untrusted data dangerously)\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The code relies on parameters supplied during instantiation, but these are typical for API wrappers and do not pose security risks.\n- No signs of injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- The static hostnames and paths are standard and do not suggest malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n## **Final conclusion:**\n\n**The scores provided in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code snippet.**  \n**I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis reflects the benign nature of the code, with no security concerns identified.",
