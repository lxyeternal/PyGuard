  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Defines an `AppStore` class inheriting from `Base`.\n- Sets static hostnames (`apps.apple.com`, `amp-api.apps.apple.com`) and URL path templates.\n- Constructor takes parameters like `country`, `app_name`, `app_id`, and logging options.\n- Initializes `_request_params` with static values and some instance variables.\n- No network calls, data handling, or untrusted input processing shown in this snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code?**  \n  No, the code appears straightforward, with no signs of bugs, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Malware presence?**  \n  No, there are no indications of malicious activity such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n\n- **Obfuscation?**  \n  No, the code is clear and standard.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities?**  \n  The code uses input parameters (`country`, `app_name`, `app_id`) to build request URLs and parameters, but they are not directly embedded in a dangerous way. They are used in URL path templates and request parameters, which is typical for API clients.\n\n---\n\n### Specific observations:\n- The reports uniformly agree that this is a benign API wrapper.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.\n- The use of static hostnames and paths is typical and not suspicious.\n- No untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks in this snippet.\n- The request parameters are static or passed during initialization, with no evident injection points.\n\n### Scores and reasoning:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malware or malicious intent detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk score:** Given the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious activity, a low risk score (~0.1-0.2) is appropriate.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- The only potential concern could be the use of user-supplied parameters (`country`, `app_name`, `app_id`) in URL paths and request parameters. If these are not sanitized elsewhere, they could potentially lead to URL injection or malformed requests. However, in this snippet, they are used as template variables, which is standard practice, and there's no evidence of injection or malicious use.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, standard API client)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my evaluation:**\nThis code is a straightforward, benign API client class for interacting with Apple's App Store review endpoints. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The use of input parameters is typical, and there are no signs of vulnerabilities or malware.\n\n**Overall scores I would assign:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus of the reports.",
