{
  "purpose": "Defines an AppStore class inheriting from Base, setting static hostnames, URL paths, and initializing request parameters for interacting with Apple App Store review APIs.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters (country, app_name, app_id) used to build URL paths and request parameters.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows into dangerous sinks or causes data leaks.",
  "flows": "Parameters flow from initialization into URL path templates and request parameters, but are used in a safe, templated manner.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API wrapper class with static hostnames and URL templates. It uses constructor parameters to set request details but does not perform any network activity, data processing, or malicious operations. No signs of obfuscation, code injection, or malicious intent are present. The parameters are used in URL templates, which is standard practice, and no untrusted data is handled insecurely. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns indicate it is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign API client for Apple App Store reviews. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk around 0.1-0.2) are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
