  "purpose": "Defines a comparison specifier class supporting operators like '==', '!=', 'in', 'not in', with logical combination and validation.",
  "sources": "Operator mappings, validation in __post_init__, __contains__ method using operator map.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, network calls, or code execution.",
  "flows": "Operator validation and comparison methods; no external data flow or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a utility class for comparison specifiers with validation, logical combination, and containment checks. It uses standard Python operators and data structures, with validation to prevent invalid operators. No external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The logic is clear, and the class functions as intended without side effects or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility class for managing comparison specifiers. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0-0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
