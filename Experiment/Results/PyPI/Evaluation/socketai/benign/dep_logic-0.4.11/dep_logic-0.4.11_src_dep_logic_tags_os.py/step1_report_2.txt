{
  "purpose": "Defines a hierarchy of immutable classes representing different operating systems and their versions for use in Python code, likely for system identification or compatibility purposes.",
  "sources": "Class definitions, especially the dataclass fields that store version or release information.",
  "sinks": "No clear data sinks that process untrusted input; code is primarily class definitions and string representations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code simply converts internal attributes to strings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. The code consists solely of data class definitions and string conversions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple data classes representing different operating systems with specific attributes, mainly version or release info. No external input handling, network operations, or executable code is present. The string methods produce standardized OS name strings from internal data. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are detected. The code appears purely structural for system identification or similar purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains only straightforward class definitions for OS representations without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not handle untrusted data or perform any insecure operations. The overall security assessment is that the code is benign.",
