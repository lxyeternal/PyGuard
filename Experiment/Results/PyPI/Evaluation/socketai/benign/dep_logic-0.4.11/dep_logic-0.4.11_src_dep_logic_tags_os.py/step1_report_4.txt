{
  "purpose": "Defines a hierarchy of classes representing various operating systems with string representations.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and their attributes, including __str__ methods and frozen dataclasses.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, input/output, or external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks, as the code only defines classes and methods.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures observed. The __str__ methods produce predictable outputs based on attributes.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a set of immutable data classes modeling different operating systems with specific attributes. The __str__ methods return formatted strings based on class attributes. No external input handling, data processing, or network interactions are present. The code is straightforward and does not contain obfuscated or suspicious logic. There are no apparent security risks, malicious behavior, or malicious code components.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, safe class hierarchy for OS representation with no signs of malicious intent or security concerns. It appears to be standard application code intended for organizing OS information.",
