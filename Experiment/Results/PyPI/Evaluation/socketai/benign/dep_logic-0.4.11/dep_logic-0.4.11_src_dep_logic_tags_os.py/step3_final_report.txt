  "purpose": "Model definitions for various operating systems with string representations for identification.",
  "sources": "No external input, data, or untrusted data sources; static class attributes and methods.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform any security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is purely structural with no data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward class definitions with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of immutable dataclass models representing different OS types, each with string methods for display. There are no data inputs, network activities, or dynamic behaviors. The code is simple, clear, and serves as a data schema. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities are present. The consistent pattern across all classes and the absence of external interactions indicate a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, purely structural set of class definitions modeling OS types with no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are accurate and appropriate.",
