  "purpose": "This code defines a hierarchy of classes representing various operating systems and their properties, primarily for descriptive or identification purposes.",
  "sources": "The code does not explicitly read input or external data; it mainly defines data structures and methods.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform any I/O operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks; the methods simply return string representations of internal attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior are detected. The code consists of class definitions and string formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of data class definitions for various OS types, providing string representations for each. It does not perform any data input, output, network activity, or external interactions. No suspicious or malicious patterns, such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms, are present. The structure is straightforward and intended for classification or descriptive purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely structural and descriptive, defining OS-related classes without performing any data processing, network activity, or other operations that could be malicious. It appears safe and benign.",
