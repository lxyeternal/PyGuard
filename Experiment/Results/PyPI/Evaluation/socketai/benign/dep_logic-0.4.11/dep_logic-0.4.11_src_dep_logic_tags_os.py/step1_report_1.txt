{
  "purpose": "Defines a hierarchy of immutable classes representing various operating system types with string representations.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; class definitions only.",
  "sinks": "No data processing or output operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely comprises class definitions using dataclasses for OS representation, implementing __str__ methods for string formatting. No external data handling, network operations, or malicious constructs are present. The structure appears straightforward and standard for modeling OS types. No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or security risks identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of class definitions modeling operating systems without any malicious intent or security concerns. It does not perform any input/output, network communication, or data processing that could pose security risks.",
