{
  "purpose": "Define classes representing various operating systems with string representations.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input handling present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs that could lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code mainly defines data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs identified. The classes are straightforward data models.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple immutable dataclasses for different operating systems, each with a __str__ method for string representation. There are no external data inputs, network operations, or security-sensitive functions. The code appears to be standard, structured, and non-malicious. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely defining data structures for OS representations without any malicious intent or security risks. It is unlikely to be involved in supply chain attacks or malicious activity.",
