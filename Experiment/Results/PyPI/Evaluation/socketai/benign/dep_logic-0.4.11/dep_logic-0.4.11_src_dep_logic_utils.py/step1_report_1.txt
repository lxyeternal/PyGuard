{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions and classes for version handling, marker transformations, set operations, and data manipulation within a larger project, likely related to dependency management.",
  "sources": "Reads version strings, marker objects, and iterable data structures; imports modules and classes for marker processing.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data, no network operations, no file writes, no environment variable use, and no external system calls identified.",
  "flows": "Input version strings are split and processed; marker objects are transformed through cnf/dnf functions; set operations and comparisons are performed within utility functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code. The code appears standard and well-structured. No unusual behaviors or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides utility functions for normalizing and transforming dependency markers and version strings. The use of cache decorators suggests performance considerations. No untrusted input handling, network activity, or file operations are present. The code does not execute external code or perform unsafe operations. All modules imported are standard or part of the same project, with no signs of malicious code. The functions focus on logical transformations and data structure management, which are safe. No anomalies like hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility module for dependency and version management with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It maintains good practices and does not perform any harmful operations. Overall security risk is very low.",
