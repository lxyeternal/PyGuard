  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for version handling and marker transformations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external sinks; data flows are internal.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. Functions perform logical transformations safely.\n- **Conclusion:** Low security risk, no malware.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar utility functions, with focus on logical forms and set operations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No unsafe data flows or external operations.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code or obfuscation; external modules are used but seem standard.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign utility code, very low security risk.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for version parsing and marker normalization.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks or malicious system calls.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns; external modules are used but appear standard.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard dependency management utilities, no malware.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions supporting dependency management.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks or system modifications.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns; functions are safe and well-structured.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign utility code, no malware.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar utility functions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external interactions or suspicious data flows.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Clearly benign, standard utility functions.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of malware:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Risk scores:** All reports assign very low risk (around 0.1), which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The functions are safe, mainly performing data parsing, logical transformations, and set operations. No assumptions or risky behaviors are present.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — very low, given the utility nature and lack of external threats.\n\n**Final note:** The code appears to be a standard, well-structured utility module for dependency and version management. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the detailed reviews and the nature of the code.",
