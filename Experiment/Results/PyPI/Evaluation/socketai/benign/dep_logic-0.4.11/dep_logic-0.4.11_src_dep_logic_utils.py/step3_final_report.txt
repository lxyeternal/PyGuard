  "purpose": "Utility functions for version parsing, logical marker transformations (CNF/DNF), set operations, and data structure management within dependency management systems.",
  "sources": "Version string splitting, marker object transformations, set and list operations, input data for version segments and marker objects.",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks, network activity, or system modifications; internal data transformations only.",
  "flows": "Version strings are split into components; marker objects are recursively transformed into CNF or DNF; set operations combine markers; data flows from input parsing to internal logical transformations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. External modules are used but appear standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions for parsing version strings, normalizing logical markers, and managing sets. It employs standard libraries, caching for performance, and recursive transformations for logical forms. No external system calls, network activity, or data leaks are present. The functions are deterministic and serve their intended benign purpose. External dependencies are assumed safe based on context. No logical errors or vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility module for dependency and version management. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The low malware score (0), obfuscation score (0), and low security risk score (~0.1) are justified based on the analysis.",
