  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for managing dependency version specifiers. It shows no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The security risk score should be lowered from 0.2 to 0 to accurately reflect the benign nature of the code."
