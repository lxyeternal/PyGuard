  "purpose": "Define and manipulate version specifiers, including unions and ranges, for dependency management.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and classes, and defines class methods and properties that process version ranges and specifiers.",
  "sinks": "Conversion to SpecifierSet, string representations, logical operations (__and__, __or__, __invert__), and comparisons. No untrusted data sources or sinks appear.",
  "flows": "Input data such as ranges and versions are processed within class methods, especially in methods like __and__, __or__, and _simplified_form, but there is no external data source or sink.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears well-structured with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic execution. No apparent backdoors or malicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data classes and methods for handling version specifiers, including union and range operations, conversions, and string representations. It leverages safe Python features, avoids unsafe eval or exec, and does not handle external input directly. The methods perform logical operations on version ranges, but no external data or untrusted sources are used. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors, are present. The code's complexity and design appear legitimate for dependency version handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of version specifier handling with no evident malicious intent or security risks. It is safe for use and does not contain malware or obfuscated code.",
