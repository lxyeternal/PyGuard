  "purpose": "Re-exports specific classes and exceptions from local modules for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.platform and .tags).",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or untrusted data handling is present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; the code only imports and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing specific classes and exceptions from relative modules and defining an __all__ list for exports. There are no external data inputs, no network activity, no dynamic execution, and no signs of malicious intent. It functions solely as a module initializer or symbol exporter, typical in Python package design.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module re-export pattern with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
