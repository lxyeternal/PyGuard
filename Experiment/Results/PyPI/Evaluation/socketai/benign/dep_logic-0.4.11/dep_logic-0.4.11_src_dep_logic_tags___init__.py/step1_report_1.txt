{
  "purpose": "The code exports specific classes and error types related to platform and tag management in a Python package.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .platform and .tags.",
  "sinks": "No sinks related to untrusted data or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to module imports and defining the __all__ list; no user input or untrusted data sources are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious patterns, or unusual code structures detected. The code appears to be straightforward module exports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes and error types from sibling modules, then exposes them via __all__ for package export. No external input, network operations, or data processing occurs. The structure is simple and typical for Python package __init__.py files. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module export setup with no malicious intent or security risks. It merely re-exports classes and errors for external use, with no suspicious or malicious code present.",
