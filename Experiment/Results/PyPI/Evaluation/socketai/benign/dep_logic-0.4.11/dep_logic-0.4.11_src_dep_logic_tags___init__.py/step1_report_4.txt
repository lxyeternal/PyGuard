  "purpose": "Re-exporting specific classes and error types from local modules for use elsewhere in the package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.platform and .tags)",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows present in the code",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; this code only re-exports symbols",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes and exceptions from local modules and defines an __all__ list for controlled exports. It functions purely as an index or aggregator module. There are no data processing, external input handling, or security-sensitive operations. The structure and syntax are straightforward and conform to standard Python practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a simple module interface for organizing exports; it contains no malicious behavior or security issues.",
