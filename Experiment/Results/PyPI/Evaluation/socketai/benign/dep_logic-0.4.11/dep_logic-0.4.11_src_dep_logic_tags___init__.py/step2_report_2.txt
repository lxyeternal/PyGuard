  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code imports classes and error types from local modules `.platform` and `.tags`.\n   - It then defines the `__all__` list to specify what symbols are exported.\n   - There are no functions, data processing, user inputs, network calls, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - The code appears to be a typical `__init__.py` or module interface file used for organizing exports in a Python package.\n\n2. **Assessment of Potential Security Risks:**\n   - The code does not handle untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - The structure is straightforward and common for package initialization.\n\n3. **Malware and Obfuscation:**\n   - All reports agree that there is no obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n   - The malware score is consistently 0 across reports, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n   - Obfuscated score is also 0, indicating no hidden or disguised code.\n\n4. **Risk Scores and Justification:**\n   - The provided risk scores are all 0 or 0.5, with the highest being 1 in some reports.\n   - Given the code's simplicity and benign nature, a risk score of 0.0 is appropriate.\n   - Since no external inputs, data flows, or potential attack vectors are present, the risk score should be minimal.\n\n5. **Consistency and Validity of Reports:**\n   - All reports correctly identify the code as a benign module export pattern.\n   - No report suggests any vulnerabilities, malicious intent, or suspicious behavior that warrants higher scores.\n\n**Final Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 — No security risks identified.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a standard, benign module export file with no security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable, but given the analysis, I would recommend setting all scores to **0.0** for malware, obfuscated, and overall risk.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Recommended Value | Justification                                              |\n|------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0.0               | No malicious behavior or code.                                |\n| Obfuscated       | 0.0               | Code is clear, straightforward, and unhidden.                |\n| Security Risk    | 0.0               | No vulnerabilities, data flows, or external interactions.   |\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms that the code is safe and non-malicious.",
