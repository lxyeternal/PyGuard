  "purpose": "Utility functions for parsing wheel filenames, environment specifications, and compatibility checks within Python package management.",
  "sources": "Parsing wheel filename components, environment spec strings, and environment variables; no external data sources or network input.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data transmission; primarily validation and exception handling within the code.",
  "flows": "Input data (filenames, spec strings, environment info) flows through validation functions and class methods to produce compatibility assessments and environment representations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard parsing, validation, and environment compatibility checks using well-established Python practices. It includes exception handling for validation errors, uses data classes for structured data, and relies on standard libraries. No network activity, code injection, or malicious behavior is present. The malware score is set to 0 due to the absence of malicious patterns. The obfuscation score is 0, as the code is clear and straightforward. The security risk score is very low (0.1), reflecting the code's benign validation role. Confidence in these conclusions is high (above 0.9), given the thorough review.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for parsing wheel filenames and environment specifications, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
