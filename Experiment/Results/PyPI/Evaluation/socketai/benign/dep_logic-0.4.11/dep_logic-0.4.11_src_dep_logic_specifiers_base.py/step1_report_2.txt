{
  "purpose": "Define abstract base classes and data structures for handling version specifiers in a package management context.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard and third-party libraries (abc, typing, packaging.specifiers, packaging.version); class and method definitions; no external input or data sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow points where untrusted input is processed or outputted; code purely defines abstract classes and types.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only provides abstract method signatures and class structure without implementation logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code is straightforward class and interface definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party modules and defines abstract classes with abstract methods for version specifier handling. It includes no executable logic or data processing, only interface specifications. No data input, output, or runtime behavior is present that could be malicious. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely structural, defining interfaces for version specifier handling. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard part of a package management or version handling library with no signs of malware or security threats.",
