  "purpose": "Define abstract base classes and types for handling version specifiers in a package management context.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard and third-party libraries (abc, typing, packaging.specifiers, packaging.version), class and method definitions, attribute and method implementations.",
  "sinks": "None identified; code does not process untrusted input, nor does it perform any I/O, network activity, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks occurs in this code segment.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines abstract classes and type aliases for handling package version specifiers, with no data processing or external interactions. The methods are abstract, meant for extension, and do not execute any logic that could be malicious. The imports are standard for version handling, and no code executes or evaluates data in a suspicious manner.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard part of a package version handling library, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is purely structural and does not perform any dangerous actions.",
