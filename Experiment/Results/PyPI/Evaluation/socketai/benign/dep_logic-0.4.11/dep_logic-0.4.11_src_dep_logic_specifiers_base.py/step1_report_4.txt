{
  "purpose": "This code defines abstract base classes and types related to version specifiers, likely for package version management.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read; the code mainly defines classes and methods.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "The code does not contain executable flows involving untrusted data; it primarily sets up class structures and abstract methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are present. The code uses standard Python features, with no obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class and method definitions for handling version specifiers, with abstract methods indicating expected implementations. It imports well-known modules ('packaging'), defines custom exceptions, and provides a clear structure without any dynamic code execution, network calls, or data handling. No code injection, malicious behavior, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a standard, harmless set of class definitions for version management, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
