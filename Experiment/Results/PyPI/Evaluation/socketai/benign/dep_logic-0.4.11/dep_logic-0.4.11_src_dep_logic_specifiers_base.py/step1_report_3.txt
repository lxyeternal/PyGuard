  "purpose": "Define abstract base classes and exceptions for handling version specifications and specifiers in a package management context.",
  "sources": "Imports of standard and third-party libraries, class and method definitions, especially reading class attributes and method parameters.",
  "sinks": "Method implementations that could process untrusted input, particularly in __contains__ and contains methods, but they are abstract and not implemented here.",
  "flows": "No concrete data flow since methods are abstract; potential flow if subclasses implement methods with untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs present. The code is a typical abstract class pattern without implementations.",
  "analysis": "This code provides abstract base classes and exception classes for version specifiers but does not contain executable logic or data handling. It relies on subclasses to implement specific behavior. There are no direct data input points or data processing that could be malicious. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured framework for version specification handling, with no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or covert channels.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard framework for handling package version specifiers, with no malicious behavior or security risks evident. It is well-structured for its purpose and does not process untrusted data directly.",
