{
  "purpose": "Provide a fixture for pytest that extends click.testing.CliRunner with enhanced debugging and testing capabilities.",
  "sources": "Importing sys, traceback.print_tb, pytest, and click.testing.CliRunner; method parameters and attributes; printing to stdout.",
  "sinks": "Printing exception details and output to stdout; assertions on exit codes.",
  "flows": "invoke() method calls super().invoke() and then prints exception and output if present; invoke_and_assert_exit() calls invoke() and checks exit code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; use of printing exception info and output is standard for debugging; no hardcoded secrets or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a pytest fixture that returns an extended CliRunner class. The extension adds debugging print statements for exceptions and outputs, which is standard debugging practice. The invoke_and_assert_exit method asserts the exit code matches expected, also typical in testing. No dynamic code execution, no network activity, no credential handling, and no obfuscated code are present. The code’s behavior appears solely focused on testing and debugging CLI applications built with click.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign testing utility extension designed for debugging click CLI applications. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The use of print statements for debugging is normal and does not indicate malicious intent.",
