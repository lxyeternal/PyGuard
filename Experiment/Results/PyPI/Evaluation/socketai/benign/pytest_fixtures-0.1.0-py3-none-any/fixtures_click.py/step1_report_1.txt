{
  "purpose": "Provides fixtures for testing Click CLI applications, with enhanced debugging and assertion capabilities.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, traceback, pytest, and click.testing; data flow occurs during invoke and invoke_and_assert_exit methods.",
  "sinks": "Printing to sys.stdout and sys.stderr within invoke method; assertion of exit code in invoke_and_assert_exit.",
  "flows": "Input data (commands, arguments) to invoke method, which then may print traceback or output; invoke_and_assert_exit asserts exit code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of print statements for traceback and output during testing, which may leak internal info in logs. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a pytest fixture that returns an enhanced CliRunner class. This class customizes the invoke method to print traceback and output details, aiding debugging. The invoke_and_assert_exit method adds an assertion for expected exit codes. All actions are related to testing and debugging CLI commands. No external data is fetched, no suspicious dynamic code execution or network activity is present. The print statements are standard for debugging and do not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a testing utility for Click CLI applications, designed for debugging and assertion purposes. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The print statements are intended for debugging output, not malicious data exfiltration.",
