{
  "purpose": "The code defines a pytest fixture for testing CLI commands using Click's testing utilities, with enhanced debugging output.",
  "sources": "Import statements, especially sys, traceback.print_tb, and pytest; within the _CliRunner class, the invoke method reads exception details and output from the result object.",
  "sinks": "The print statements output exception traceback and command output to stdout, which could reveal sensitive information if exceptions contain such data.",
  "flows": "If an exception occurs during CLI invocation, the traceback and exception are printed. Otherwise, the command output is printed. The invoke_and_assert_exit method calls invoke and then asserts the exit code, leading to output depending on the success or failure of the command.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious or unusual code constructs. The code uses standard testing patterns. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code are evident. The print statements are used solely for debugging output.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a pytest fixture for CLI testing with an extended CliRunner class that outputs detailed debug information when invoking CLI commands. The invoke method captures exceptions and output, printing traceback and output for debugging purposes. The invoke_and_assert_exit method simplifies testing by asserting expected exit codes. No external data sources, untrusted input handling, or dangerous behaviors are present. The code's behavior is aligned with debugging and testing purposes without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test fixture for CLI command testing with enhanced debugging output. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears safe and designed for development/testing convenience.",
