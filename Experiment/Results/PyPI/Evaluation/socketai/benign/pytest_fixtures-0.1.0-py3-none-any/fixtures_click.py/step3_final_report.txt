  "purpose": "Provides a pytest fixture that extends click.testing.CliRunner with debugging output for better error visibility during CLI testing.",
  "sources": "Reading input parameters in invoke(), exception traceback, and output data from command execution.",
  "sinks": "Printing exception traceback and command output to stdout, which could potentially leak sensitive information if exceptions contain secrets.",
  "flows": "invoke() method calls super().invoke(), then prints exception traceback and output if present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of print statements for debugging purposes; no obfuscation, malicious code, or external data fetching detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a testing fixture that enhances click CLI testing with debug print statements. It does not perform network activity, code injection, or handle secrets explicitly. The traceback and output printing could leak sensitive info but are standard debugging practices. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the code's benign purpose, considering the slight risk of info leakage during debugging.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, debugging utility for CLI testing with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The low risk score accounts for potential info leaks via debug prints but does not indicate malicious intent.",
