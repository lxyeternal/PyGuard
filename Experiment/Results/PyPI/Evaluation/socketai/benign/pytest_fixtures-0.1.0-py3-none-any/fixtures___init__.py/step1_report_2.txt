  "sources": "File system access via Path objects; reading and writing files; setting and getting BASE_PATH.",
  "targets": "File system (reading/writing test data files); no untrusted data input sources or external network access.",
  "flows": "Methods use Path to locate files, then read/write file contents, with optional JSON serialization/deserialization.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Use of Path and json is standard for test fixtures.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for test data management, including setting base directory, reading, and writing test files. No user input, network access, or data leaks are present. No obfuscation or malicious constructs are evident. The code appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical test fixture utility with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It only manages test data files using safe practices.",
