{
  "purpose": "This code is designed for detecting and reporting the environment, connectors, and versions related to the Firebolt SDK, likely for logging or telemetry purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the call stack via 'inspect.stack()' and from imported modules and attributes such as '__version__' and 'modules'. It also reads data from the filesystem through 'Path' objects, although these are used mainly for comparison and importing modules.",
  "sinks": "The code generates a user-agent string based on detected versions and system info, which could potentially leak environment details if exposed externally, but does not perform harmful actions with untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The stack inspection gathers runtime call context; version imports and attribute reads retrieve environment and module info; these data are combined into a user-agent string. No untrusted external input is processed; data flow is limited to internal environment inspection.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. The code performs environment detection without obfuscation. It gracefully handles exceptions in stack inspection, with debug logs. No suspicious or malicious behavior is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment and connector detection through stack inspection, module imports, and version reads. It constructs user-agent strings with system info and connector versions for telemetry. No data exfiltration, malicious commands, or obfuscated code are present. The only potential concern is leaking environment info via user-agent headers, which is standard in telemetry but could be misused if exposed. All functionalities are consistent with environment introspection and version reporting, with proper exception handling and no suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign environment and version detection utility intended for telemetry or logging. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It merely inspects runtime context and builds a descriptive string. The code appears safe and purposeful within its scope.",
