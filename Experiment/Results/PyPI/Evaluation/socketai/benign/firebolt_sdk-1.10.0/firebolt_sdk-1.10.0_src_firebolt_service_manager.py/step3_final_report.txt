  "purpose": "This code defines a ResourceManager class for managing Firebolt SDK resources, including API client setup, service initialization, and connection handling, supporting multiple API versions.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters, auth object methods, environment variables, and internal validation functions.",
  "sinks": "API requests via the _client object, database connections via connect(), and resource service calls.",
  "flows": "Input parameters and auth data flow into API client creation, service initialization, and connection setup.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected; deprecation warning is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard SDK resource management tasks with proper validation, version handling, and resource initialization. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows are present. The use of warnings and assertions is appropriate. The code's behavior aligns with legitimate SDK components, and no signs of malicious activity or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured SDK resource manager with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are justified and accurate.",
