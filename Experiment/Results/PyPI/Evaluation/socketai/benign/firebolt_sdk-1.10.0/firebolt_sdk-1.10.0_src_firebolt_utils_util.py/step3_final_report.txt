  "purpose": "Utility functions for URL manipulation, response handling, logging, validation, and timing within an SDK or API client context.",
  "sources": "URL parsing and modification functions, response error handling, environment variables for debug logging, input parameters for functions.",
  "sinks": "Logging output, exception raising, URL copying/modification, response decoding, environment variable checks.",
  "flows": "Input URL or response data -> functions process and validate -> potential logging or exception raising based on conditions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Use of environment variables for debugging is standard but should be managed carefully.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard utility functions used in SDKs or API clients. Functions such as URL fixing, merging, error extraction, and response validation are straightforward and well-structured. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage are present. Environment variables for debugging are typical and do not indicate malicious intent. The malware score is appropriately zero, and the low security risk score reflects minimal threat. The code's clarity and lack of suspicious patterns support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, with no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. It performs standard utility functions with proper error handling and logging. The low risk score is justified, and no modifications are necessary.",
