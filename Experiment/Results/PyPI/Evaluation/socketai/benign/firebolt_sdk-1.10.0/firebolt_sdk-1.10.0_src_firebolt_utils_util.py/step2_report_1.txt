  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Utility functions for URL, response, and logging.\n- Key points: No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, benign environment variable use.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2 (low)\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as standard utility functions with no malicious behavior. The low malware and security risk scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar utility functions, focusing on URL handling and error processing.\n- Key points: No suspicious secrets, environment variables used for debugging are standard.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2\n- Confidence: 0.95\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's functionality. No signs of malicious activity, and the scores seem justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Utility functions for URL and response processing.\n- Key points: No malicious code, environment variables for debug logging are benign.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with previous analyses; the code is standard utility code with no malware.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Utility functions for URL, response, and timing.\n- Key points: No suspicious patterns, environment variables for debugging are typical.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious indicators, scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Utility functions for URL, error handling, and timing.\n- Key points: No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated or suspicious code, standard practices.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is thorough and aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n- **Code Content:** All reports agree that the code is composed of utility functions for URL manipulation, response error handling, logging, and timing—standard in SDKs or API clients.\n- **Malware Indicators:** None of the reports detect any malicious payloads, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity.\n- **Obfuscation:** Not present.\n- **Potential Vulnerabilities:** The only possible concern is the use of environment variables for debug logging (`FIREBOLT_SDK_PERFORMANCE_DEBUG`), which, if exploited, could leak internal timing information or be used for side-channel inference. However, this is a common pattern and not inherently malicious.\n- **Supply Chain Risks:** No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or code that could be exploited for malicious purposes are present.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1–0.2** — Minimal, primarily related to debug environment variable exposure, which is typical and manageable.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears safe, with no signs of malware or sabotage. The low security risk scores are justified. The environment variable for debugging should be managed carefully in production, but it does not constitute a security threat on its own.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (due to environment variable exposure, but generally low risk)  \n\nThis comprehensive review confirms the code's safety and utility nature, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities evident.",
