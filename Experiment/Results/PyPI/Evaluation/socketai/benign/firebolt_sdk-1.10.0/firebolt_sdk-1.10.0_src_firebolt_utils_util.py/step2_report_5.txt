  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and the described logic.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for URL manipulation, response handling, logging, and validation. No malicious activity detected. Scores: malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0.\n\n- **Assessment:** The functions such as `get_auth_endpoint`, `parse_url_and_params`, and error handling are standard. The code doesn't contain any obfuscated or malicious patterns. The low security risk score (0.2) seems reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The report's reasoning aligns with the code. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar utility functions, with focus on URL handling, error processing, and timing. No suspicious activity or backdoors. Scores: malware=0, risk=0.2.\n\n- **Assessment:** The functions like `get_internal_error_code`, `raise_errors_from_body`, and `merge_urls` are standard. Use of environment variables for debug logging is typical. No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The analysis is consistent. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for URL processing, error handling, and response validation. No malware or obfuscation. Scores: malware=0, risk=0.2.\n\n- **Assessment:** The functions such as `Timer`, `parse_url_and_params`, and error handling are straightforward. Environment variable use for debugging is common.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment matches the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for URL manipulation, response handling, and timing. No signs of malicious activity. Scores: malware=0, risk=0.2.\n\n- **Assessment:** Functions like `get_auth_endpoint`, `raise_errors_from_body`, and `Timer` are standard. No obfuscated or malicious code.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The analysis is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for URL handling, error processing, and debugging. No malicious behavior. Scores: malware=0, risk=0.1.\n\n- **Assessment:** The functions are typical, environment variables for debugging are standard, no suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Analysis:** The code is a collection of utility functions for URL parsing, error handling, response processing, and logging. All functions are standard, well-structured, and do not contain any obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is justified. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; no obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Risk Score:** The low scores (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code, with some environmental considerations for debug logging.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1-0.2 (consistent with the reports)\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.15 (a slight increase over the reports to reflect standard environmental controls, but still very low)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, with no signs of supply chain security issues or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and aligned with the code analysis.",
