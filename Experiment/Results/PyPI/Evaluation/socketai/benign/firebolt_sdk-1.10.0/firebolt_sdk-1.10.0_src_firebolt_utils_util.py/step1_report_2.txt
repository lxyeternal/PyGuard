  "purpose": "Utility functions and classes for URL handling, error processing, caching, and timing within a Python SDK or application.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (environ), HTTP responses (resp), input URLs (url), and response bodies (resp.text, resp.json).",
  "sinks": "Logging outputs, raising exceptions, and manipulating URLs and response data.",
  "flows": "Input URLs are processed via fix_url_schema, parse_url_and_params, or get_auth_endpoint. HTTP responses are checked via get_internal_error_code, raise_errors_from_body, and logged. Environment variables influence performance debug logging. Environment variables and response data influence flow control.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors. Use of environment variable 'FIREBOLT_SDK_PERFORMANCE_DEBUG' for debug logging is standard practice. No obfuscated code, malicious string manipulations, or dynamic code execution. Error handling appears standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of utility functions for URL manipulation, response error handling, and timing measurement, all typical for SDK or client library code. get_auth_endpoint modifies hostnames in a predictable manner, and merge_urls concatenates URL paths. raise_errors_from_body attempts to parse JSON error responses to raise structured exceptions. Environment variables are used solely for debug logging control. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The code's structure and function are aligned with legitimate SDK functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility functions for URL and response processing with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It includes common error handling, logging, and environment variable checks typical in SDKs. There are no suspicious behaviors or indicators of supply chain attacks.",
