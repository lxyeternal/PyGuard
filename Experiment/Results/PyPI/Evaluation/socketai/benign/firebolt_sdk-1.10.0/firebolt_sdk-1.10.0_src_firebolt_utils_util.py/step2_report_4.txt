  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core logic, potential vulnerabilities, and consistency of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for URL manipulation, response handling, logging, and validation. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected. Malware score: 0.  \n- **Assessment:** The functions such as `get_auth_endpoint`, `parse_url_and_params`, and error handling appear standard. The URL modification in `get_auth_endpoint` is predictable and safe. Error handling is robust, with try-except blocks. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code.  \n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2 — reasonable given the benign nature.  \n- **Conclusion:** The analysis aligns with the code; no issues.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar utility functions, with focus on URL handling, error processing, and timing. No malicious behavior.  \n- **Assessment:** The functions like `merge_urls`, `raise_errors_from_body`, and environment variable-based debugging are standard. No signs of malicious code or backdoors.  \n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2 — appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** Consistent with the code; no concerns.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for URL, error handling, and timing, with no signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Assessment:** The environment variable for debug timing is benign if controlled. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.  \n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2 — fitting.  \n- **Conclusion:** The code is standard utility code.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for URL, response, error, and timing. No malicious behavior detected.  \n- **Assessment:** All functions are typical, with environment variables used for debugging. No suspicious side effects.  \n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2 — appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** No issues.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar utility functions, standard practices, no malicious activity.  \n- **Assessment:** Use of environment variables for debug logging is common; no obfuscation or backdoors.  \n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.1 — reasonable.  \n- **Conclusion:** Consistent and safe.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate given the code clarity.\n- **Risk score:** The scores range from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting low security risk, which is justified given the utility nature of the code and absence of vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware estimate:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated estimate:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk estimate:** **0.1–0.2** — minimal, mostly due to environment variable-based debugging, which is standard.\n\n**In conclusion,** the provided scores are reasonable and consistent with the code analysis. No adjustments are necessary. The code appears safe, with no signs of supply chain compromise or malicious intent.",
