  "purpose": "Utility functions and helpers for URL manipulation, error handling, and response processing within a Python SDK or client library.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, parsing URLs, reading response text and JSON content.",
  "sinks": "Logging error details, raising exceptions based on response content, and reading response bodies.",
  "flows": "Environment variable check in Timer class -> Response body reading in _print_error_body and raise_errors_from_body -> URL parsing in parse_url_and_params -> Error logging/raising in response processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic code execution. Use of environment variable for debugging performance timing is typical but could be misused if environment variables are compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for URL processing, error handling, and response validation. It does not contain malicious code such as network connections to suspicious domains, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The environment variable check for performance debugging is benign but should be kept secure. Response parsing and error handling appear standard and safe. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are evident. Usage of third-party libraries is standard for HTTP requests and URL parsing. Overall, the code seems to perform expected utility functions with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions for URL handling, error management, and performance timing, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It does not contain malware or security risks that pose an immediate threat, assuming the environment variables are controlled. The overall security risk score is low.",
