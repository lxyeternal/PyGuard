  "purpose": "Utility functions and classes for URL manipulation, response handling, logging, and configuration validation within a larger Python SDK or application.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (environ), HTTP response bodies (Response), URL parsing and query parameters, function arguments (URL, response, dicts, strings).",
  "sinks": "Logging (logger), raising exceptions (raise), modifying URLs (copy_with), decoding response body (resp.json, resp.read).",
  "flows": "Input data (URLs, environment variables, responses) are processed through parsing, validation, and error handling functions, with some data (like response errors) potentially triggering exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets present. No suspicious backdoors or obfuscated code detected. Usage of environment variables for debug logging is benign but warrants caution in production. No unusual dynamic code execution. The code follows standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code contains utility functions for URL handling, response error processing, and logging, with standard safety measures. The get_auth_endpoint constructs URLs in a predictable manner, and parse_url_and_params extracts URL components securely. Error handling functions attempt to parse response bodies and raise structured errors if applicable. No indications of malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or covert operations are evident. No hardcoded secrets or unsafe code patterns identified. Use of environment variable controls for debug logging is typical but should be managed securely in production environments.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be well-structured utility code for managing URLs, responses, and configurations in a larger SDK or application. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. Security risks are minimal, primarily related to standard logging practices and error handling. Overall, the code is safe and does not contain malware.",
