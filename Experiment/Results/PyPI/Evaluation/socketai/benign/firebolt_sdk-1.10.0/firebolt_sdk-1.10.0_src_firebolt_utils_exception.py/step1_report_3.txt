{
  "purpose": "This code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for error handling in a Firebolt database client or SDK.",
  "sources": "The code mainly reads class definitions, constructor arguments, and error message templates. No external data inputs are present.",
  "sinks": "Error message strings are constructed with input parameters, but they are not used in any insecure or unsafe context (e.g., system calls, network, eval). No external sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; exception classes only format and store error details internally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior are detected. The code uses standard exception inheritance and string formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for various error types, including detailed documentation. No input validation, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present. No suspicious or malicious patterns are identified. It appears to be a straightforward error handling module for a database SDK.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It does not perform any I/O, data processing, or network activity that could be exploited. The malware score is very low, and overall security risk is negligible.",
