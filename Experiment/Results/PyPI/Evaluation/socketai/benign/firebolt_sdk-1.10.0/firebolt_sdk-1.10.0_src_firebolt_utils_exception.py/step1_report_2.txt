  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various errors in the Firebolt SDK.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code only defines classes and constructors.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no data processing, network calls, or data output are present.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow, only class definitions and initializations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code solely consists of class definitions for error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of custom exception classes for the Firebolt SDK, intended for structured error handling. It includes various error types like connection issues, database errors, authentication, authorization, and internal errors, each with clear message formatting. There are no external inputs, network operations, or code execution based on untrusted data. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are present. The classes are straightforward, with constructors mainly for message formatting and attribute storage. Overall, the code serves as a structured error hierarchy with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is purely definitional, establishing a hierarchy of exception classes for the SDK's error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities. The code is safe and conventional for error handling in Python SDKs.",
