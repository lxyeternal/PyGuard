  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, the security implications, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code defines a comprehensive hierarchy of custom exception classes for a Firebolt SDK/client.\n- It includes error classes for connection issues, authentication, authorization, database errors, engine errors, query errors, structured error parsing, and more.\n- The classes mainly store error messages, attributes, and formatting logic.\n- There are no external data inputs, network operations, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated patterns.\n- Error messages are constructed from parameters or JSON data, but all are internal or passed-in data, with no evident security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code is straightforward class definitions; no issues or bugs are apparent.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected.\n- **Security risks:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic.\n- **Data flow/security concerns:** No untrusted data is processed in a way that could cause vulnerabilities; error messages are constructed from internal data or parameters.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n- The code is purely definitional and follows standard patterns.\n\n### Score Review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the clean, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or very low (0.1 in one case). Given the absence of vulnerabilities, this seems appropriate.\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- Not applicable here; the code does not contain any security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior that would warrant a higher score.\n- The highest risk score assigned is 0.1, which is acceptable for minimal, non-malicious security considerations.\n\n### Consistency and anomalies:\n- All reports are consistent with the code's nature.\n- No anomalies or suspicious claims are present.\n- The error message formatting is safe, as it uses parameters and JSON data, not untrusted code execution.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a standard, well-structured set of exception classes.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0 or 0.1) are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (since no vulnerabilities or malicious intent are present)\n\n**Conclusion:** The current scoring and analysis are accurate and justified. The code is safe, standard, and does not pose security concerns.",
