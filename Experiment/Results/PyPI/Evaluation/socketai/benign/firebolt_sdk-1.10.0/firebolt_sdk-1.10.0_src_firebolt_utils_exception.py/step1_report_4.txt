{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for Firebolt database and engine error handling, including error messaging and attributes.",
  "sources": "Class constructors, string formatting in exception messages, attribute assignments.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or external outputs identified.",
  "flows": "Construction of exception objects and raising them; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors observed. No obfuscation or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides structured exception classes for various Firebolt errors, handling error messaging and attributes. It uses standard Python class definitions, string formatting, and inheritance. There are no input/output operations, network calls, or external data handling. All error messages are static or derived from passed parameters, with no apparent malicious intent. The code appears purely for error handling and does not contain any suspicious or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of structured exception class definitions for error handling in a Firebolt database context. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or sabotage. The implementation is standard, straightforward, and secure. The overall security risk is very low.",
