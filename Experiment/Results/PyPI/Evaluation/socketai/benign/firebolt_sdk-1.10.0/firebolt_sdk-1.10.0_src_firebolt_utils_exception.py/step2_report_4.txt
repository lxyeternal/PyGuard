  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a straightforward set of custom exception classes for a Firebolt SDK, with no dynamic code, external data processing, or network interactions.\n   - No untrusted data is directly used in a way that could cause security issues.\n   - The error messages are constructed from internal data or parameters, with no signs of data leakage or injection.\n   - No suspicious or malicious behaviors such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or code injection are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that the code is purely definitional, with no malicious intent.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - The assessments of security risk, malware, and obfuscation are appropriate given the nature of the code.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Security risk scores are also low or zero, aligning with the code's benign nature.\n   - No adjustments needed; the scores seem reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.1, which is justified.\n   - The code is purely for error handling and does not perform any operations that could lead to security vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n   - No malicious behavior is detected or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are based on objective observations; no unwarranted assumptions are made.\n   - The analysis correctly states that the code is safe and standard for exception handling.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores align well with the detailed analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard, well-structured set of exception classes for a database SDK.\n- There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The malware score should remain at 0.\n- The security risk score should stay very low, around 0 or 0.1, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n**My personal estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (to account for the fact that it's error handling code, but very low risk)\n\n**Final note:** The code's purpose is purely definitional for error handling, with no security concerns.",
