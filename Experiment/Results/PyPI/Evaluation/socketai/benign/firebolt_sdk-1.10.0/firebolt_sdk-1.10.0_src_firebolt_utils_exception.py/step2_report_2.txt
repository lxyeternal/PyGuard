  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Defines custom exception classes for Firebolt, covering various error scenarios.\n- **Sources:** Class definitions, constructors, string formatting.\n- **Sinks:** No untrusted data used as sinks; error messages are constructed from internal data or parameters.\n- **Flows:** Data flows are limited to JSON error data to formatted messages; no external data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** The code is purely class definitions for error handling, with no external system interactions or dynamic code execution.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent or security risks; safe and standard.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, focusing on defining exception classes.\n- No external data, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n- The code is straightforward and purely for error hierarchy.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior; safe.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Again, exception class definitions for Firebolt errors.\n- No external inputs, no I/O, no dynamic code.\n- Uses string formatting for error messages, based on parameters.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious or security issues detected.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Defines Firebolt error classes with message formatting.\n- No external data or system interactions.\n- No suspicious patterns.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, but a slight mention of 0.1, which is acceptable given the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent; safe.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar to previous, defining error classes with standard patterns.\n- No external data, code execution, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** No security concerns; standard implementation.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports describe class definitions for exception handling—no code that executes untrusted data, no network calls, no file I/O, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** Malware score is 0 in all reports, and obfuscation is 0, which aligns with the code being straightforward class definitions.\n- **Security Risks:** Given the nature of the code, the risk is negligible. The only minor note is the 0.1 in report 4, which is acceptable given the context.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No assumptions about untrusted data leading to code execution or data exfiltration are present.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The **malware score** should remain at **0**.\n- The **obfuscated score** should be **0**.\n- The **risk score** should be **very low**, around **0.1**, reflecting the benign nature but acknowledging that error handling code can sometimes be a vector if misused, though unlikely here.\n\n### Overall:\n**The code is a standard, safe set of exception class definitions with no malicious or security concerns.**",
