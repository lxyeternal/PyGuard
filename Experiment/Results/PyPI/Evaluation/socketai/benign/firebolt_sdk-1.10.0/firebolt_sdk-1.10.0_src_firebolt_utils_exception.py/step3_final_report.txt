{
  "purpose": "The code defines a comprehensive hierarchy of custom exception classes for the Firebolt SDK, covering various error scenarios such as connection issues, authentication, database errors, engine errors, query errors, and structured error parsing. It serves as a structured error handling framework for the SDK.",
  "sources": "Class definitions, constructors, string formatting for error messages, JSON error data in FireboltStructuredError",
  "sinks": "Error message strings constructed from internal data or parameters; no untrusted external data is directly used as a sink",
  "flows": "Parameters and JSON data flow into error message formatting within class constructors; no external data processing or network operations occur",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions used in the Firebolt SDK. It employs standard Python class structures, with constructors initializing error messages from parameters or JSON data. There are no external data inputs, network calls, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated patterns. Error messages are safely formatted from internal or passed-in data, with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The code is purely definitional, intended for structured error handling, and aligns with best practices. No anomalies or security concerns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe set of exception class definitions with no malicious or security-related issues. All scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
