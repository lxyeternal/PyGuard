{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various error conditions in the Firebolt SDK.",
  "sources": "The code reads input in the form of error parameters and class instantiation arguments, mainly from function calls and exception triggers.",
  "sinks": "Exception handling mechanisms that raise errors based on input parameters, logging or output of exception messages.",
  "flows": "Error conditions are triggered by specific input parameters; these lead to instantiation of exception objects, which are then raised and possibly caught elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are present. Exception classes follow standard design. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines custom exception classes for a Python SDK. Each class handles specific error scenarios, including details such as error messages and attributes. The code uses standard Python syntax, proper inheritance, and typical exception handling patterns. No external inputs, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present. The code appears to serve as a structured error management system without any malicious behavior or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured set of exception classes for error handling in the Firebolt SDK. It does not contain malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks. The overall security risk is negligible, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
