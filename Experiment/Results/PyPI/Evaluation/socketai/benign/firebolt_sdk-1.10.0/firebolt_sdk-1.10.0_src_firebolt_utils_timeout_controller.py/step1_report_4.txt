  "purpose": "A class to manage and enforce query timeout limits by tracking elapsed time and raising an exception when the limit is reached.",
  "sources": "Reads input data during class initialization (timeout parameter) and when calling time() within raise_if_timeout() and remaining() methods.",
  "sinks": "Raises an exception (QueryTimeoutError) if timeout is exceeded.",
  "flows": "Input (timeout) -> time() -> comparison in raise_if_timeout() -> potential exception raise; remaining() computes remaining time based on current time.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors. The code simply manages timing logic with standard library calls and a custom exception.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a TimeoutController class that tracks the start time at initialization. It provides methods to check if the timeout has been exceeded and to compute remaining time. The timing logic uses standard time() function, and exceptions are raised via a user-defined class. There are no external network calls, data leaks, or malicious code patterns. The code appears to be a straightforward timeout management utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a simple timeout controller without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware or suspicious behavior and is a typical implementation of timeout logic.",
