  "purpose": "A class to manage query timeouts by checking if a timeout has been reached and calculating remaining time.",
  "sources": "The 'time' function for capturing start time and measuring elapsed time.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "time() is called to measure elapsed time, and the remaining time is calculated based on stored start_time and timeout value.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a straightforward timeout control class using standard time measurement functions. It initializes with an optional timeout value, records the start time, and checks whether the current time exceeds the allowed duration. It raises an exception if the timeout is reached and calculates remaining time. No external data sources, user inputs, or external communications are present. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious code are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple timeout management utility with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs a standard function securely without external dependencies or suspicious patterns.",
