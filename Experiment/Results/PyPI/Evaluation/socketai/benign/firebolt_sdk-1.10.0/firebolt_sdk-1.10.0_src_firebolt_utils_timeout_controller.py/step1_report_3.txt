  "purpose": "A class to manage query timeouts by tracking elapsed time and raising errors if the timeout is exceeded.",
  "sources": "Reads current time via time() function at initialization and during method calls.",
  "sinks": "Raising QueryTimeoutError when timeout conditions are met.",
  "flows": "time() is called in __init__, raise_if_timeout, and remaining to check elapsed time; raises QueryTimeoutError if timeout exceeded.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic; straightforward timeout management.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for controlling query timeouts. It initializes with a given timeout, records the start time, and checks whether the timeout has been reached. If so, it raises a standard exception. The code uses standard Python libraries and a custom exception class from firebolt.utils, with no dynamic code execution or external data handling. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured timeout controller with no malicious intent or security issues. It simply manages query timeout logic without any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
