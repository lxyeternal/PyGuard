{
  "purpose": "A class to control and manage the timeout of query sequences, checking if timeout has been reached and calculating remaining time.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the 'timeout' parameter during initialization and the 'time()' function to check current time.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'raise' to throw exceptions if timeout occurs; no other sink present.",
  "flows": "Input 'timeout' value is stored; 'time()' is called repeatedly in 'raise_if_timeout' and 'remaining' to compare against 'start_time' + 'timeout'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. No external data being fetched or sent. No obfuscated or malicious logic found.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward timeout controller class that manages timing for queries. It captures start time upon initialization, checks for timeout in 'raise_if_timeout', and calculates remaining time in 'remaining'. No dynamic code execution, no data leakage, no network activity, or malicious logic present. The only operations are time comparisons and exception raising based on the timing logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard timeout management utility with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs basic timing checks safely and transparently.",
