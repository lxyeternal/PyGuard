  "purpose": "Manage and enforce query execution timeouts by tracking elapsed time and raising exceptions when the timeout is reached.",
  "sources": "time() function for current time; class initialization input 'timeout' parameter",
  "sinks": "raise_if_timeout() method raises an exception (QueryTimeoutError) when timeout is exceeded",
  "flows": "Initialization reads 'timeout', start_time is set with current time; raise_if_timeout() compares current time with start_time + timeout; remaining() calculates remaining time based on current time",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code patterns, no obfuscation, no data exfiltration or malicious system access detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple timeout management class. It initializes with an optional timeout value, records the start time, and provides methods to check if the timeout has been reached or to compute remaining time. The raise_if_timeout() method raises a predefined exception if the timeout is exceeded, which is typical for timeout handling. There are no external data inputs, suspicious code, or malicious behaviors. The use of standard time functions and straightforward logic pose no security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign timeout control class with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard timeout checks and exception raising, consistent with expected behavior in query management.",
