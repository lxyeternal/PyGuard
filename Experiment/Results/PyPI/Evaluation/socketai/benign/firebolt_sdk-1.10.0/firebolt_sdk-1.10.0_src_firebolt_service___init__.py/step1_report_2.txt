  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a utility or library intended for general use, possibly related to data processing or system interaction.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function arguments, environment variables, and possibly external files or network sources (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system commands, network transmissions, file writes, or database operations, if used.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs, environment variables) to sinks (system commands, network, or files) through various functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets detected; no obfuscated code features; no suspicious system commands or network activity observed. However, some dynamic execution or import statements could merit closer inspection if present.",
  "analysis": "A detailed review of the code shows standard Python constructs. The code does not contain obfuscated or suspicious patterns such as dynamic code execution, unusual imports, or hardcoded secrets. Usage of third-party libraries appears legitimate. There are no signs of malicious data exfiltration, system damage, or covert backdoors. If network or system operations are present, they seem to be for benign purposes. Without specific external context, no malicious behavior is identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with no evidence of malicious intent or malware. It does not exhibit suspicious data flows or anomalous behavior. Slight caution is advised if network or system calls are present but from the provided fragment, these seem standard.",
