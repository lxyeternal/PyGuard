  "purpose": "To evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and suspicious patterns based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Code input, data reads, environment variables, network calls, file operations, dynamic execution points.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network transmissions, file modifications, environment variable access, system commands.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks through data processing, network requests, or environment variable usage, indicating potential malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "Any hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, dynamic code execution, suspicious network domains, or unusual control flow.",
  "analysis": "All reports consistently indicate benign, straightforward code with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious indicators. Malware scores are zero, aligning with the benign assessments. Security risk scores are low (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal concern given the descriptions. Confidence levels are high (0.8-0.9), justified by the lack of concrete code evidence. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected across reports. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the provided summaries.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are justified. Overall, the dependency is considered safe based on the available information.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
