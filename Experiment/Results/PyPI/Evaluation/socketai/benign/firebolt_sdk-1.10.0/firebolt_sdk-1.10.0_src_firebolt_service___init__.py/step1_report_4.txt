  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python script that performs some data processing, potentially involving external inputs and outputs.",
  "sources": "Input functions such as reading from files, environment variables, or user input prompts.",
  "sinks": "Data outputs such as writing to files, network communication, or printing to the console.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) through processing functions to sinks (outputs).",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials or tokens, unusual use of dynamic code execution, or obscure code patterns. No such anomalies detected at first glance.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily uses standard Python libraries with clear function definitions. No suspicious network activity, no code injection, and no obfuscated code patterns observed. All data handling appears to be straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads. The structure is clear and consistent, indicating typical data processing functionality.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems to serve a legitimate purpose without malicious intent.",
