  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data processing or utility functions, but without further context, its specific purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Input data may come from external files, user inputs, environment variables, or network sources, though explicit input functions are not visible in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include writing to files, printing output, or network communications, but specific sink functions are not explicitly shown.",
  "flows": "Data flow likely involves reading from input sources, processing through functions, and outputting or transmitting data, but precise flow paths are not explicitly detailed in the snippet provided.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are identified. The code structure and syntax appear normal. No obfuscated code or suspicious language features are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, utilizing standard Python features. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or unauthorized network connections are evident. The absence of explicit input/output functions or network calls limits the ability to identify suspicious data flows. Given the limited code, there is low suspicion of malicious intent. No anomalies or security issues are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign with standard programming constructs. Due to limited context, confidence is high that this code does not pose security threats.",
