  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to the __version__ variable, serving as a package version indicator.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data sinks or outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow; simple assignment of a string to a variable.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is a straightforward, standard version assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard pattern in Python packages for versioning, involving a single string assignment. No inputs, outputs, data flows, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. No logical flaws or suspicious behaviors are detected. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified by the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no security risks or malicious intent. It is a standard version declaration statement with no vulnerabilities or suspicious behavior.",
