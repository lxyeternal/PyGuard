  "purpose": "Definition of URL endpoints for various API resources related to account, engine, database, provider, region, and authentication services.",
  "sources": "String literals defining URL paths, including formatted strings with placeholders (e.g., {account_id}, {database_id}).",
  "sinks": "None; the code only defines URL strings, which are used as endpoints; no data processing or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; there are no data flows or untrusted data inputs within this code snippet, as it only defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution or secret leaks. The URL paths appear to be standard API endpoint definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of string assignments for URL endpoints with parameter placeholders, serving as API resource paths. No input handling, data processing, or security-sensitive operations are present. The structure appears straightforward, following typical REST API URL patterns. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or malicious constructs are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of static URL endpoint definitions for API access. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks by itself. It appears to be part of a larger codebase where these URLs are used to interact with a backend service. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious activity.",
