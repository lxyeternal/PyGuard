  "purpose": "Static URL endpoint definitions for API resources, serving as configuration constants.",
  "sources": "String literals with placeholders for dynamic parameters, no input handling or data processing.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external input processed.",
  "flows": "N/A; static strings without data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward URL strings with placeholders, no obfuscation or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string assignments defining API endpoint URLs with placeholders for parameters. There is no dynamic code, input handling, data processing, or network activity. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are present. The URLs follow standard REST API patterns. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious behavior or security risks. The assigned scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk are consistent and justified given the nature of the code. The confidence level is high (1) due to the simplicity and clarity of the code. There are no indications of malicious intent or vulnerabilities in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration of static API endpoint URLs with no malicious or security concerns. The assessments and scores in all reports are accurate and appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
