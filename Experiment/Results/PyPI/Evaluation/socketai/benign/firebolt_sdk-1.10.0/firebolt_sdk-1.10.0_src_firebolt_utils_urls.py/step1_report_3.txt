{
  "purpose": "Defines URL endpoints for API interactions related to account, engine, database, provider, and region management.",
  "sources": "String assignments of URL paths; no input or external data reading present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data influences system behavior; no data leaks or malicious actions detected.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; purely static URL definitions with parameter placeholders.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior. URL structures appear standard and intended for API routing.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only static string definitions for various API endpoint URLs with placeholders for dynamic parameters. There are no input reading, data processing, or untrusted data handling observed. No malicious logic, code injection, or obfuscation is present. The structure indicates API route configuration, typical for a service client or SDK.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of URL endpoint definitions with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a normal configuration file for API interactions, with no anomalies or malicious intent detected.",
