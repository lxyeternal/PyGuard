  "purpose": "Defines URL endpoints for various API services related to account management, engines, databases, providers, regions, and authentication.",
  "sources": "String assignments containing URL path templates and concatenations.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling, external inputs, or sensitive data processing present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code primarily sets URL strings.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious logic observed. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of constant string definitions for API endpoints. There are no input processing, data manipulation, or network activities. The URL templates include placeholders for dynamic data but do not involve any runtime code execution, environment variable access, or obfuscated constructs. Usage appears to be straightforward URL configuration for an API client.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of URL endpoint definitions for an API client. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. It appears to be safe and intended for standard API interaction.",
