  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code defines static URL endpoints for various API resources; no data handling or dynamic code involved.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no suspicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion that this code is safe and standard is accurate. The high confidence and zero scores are justified.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, static URL definitions with no external input or data processing.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies or malicious constructs detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent; the code appears safe and straightforward.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, static URL strings with placeholders, no input handling or malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identified as safe, standard URL configuration.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Static URL constants with concatenations, no dynamic code or secrets.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies or malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Valid conclusion; the code is safe.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—static URL strings with no dynamic or untrusted data.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is purely static URL definitions, with no data processing, no input handling, and no obfuscation.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports assign zero, which is appropriate given the content.\n- **Risk Score:** All are zero, which is justified as there are no security risks or malicious behaviors.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should stay at 0, given the straightforward string assignments.\n- **Risk Score:** Correctly at 0, as the code is purely configuration with no vulnerabilities.\n\n**Additional notes:**  \nNo evidence suggests any hidden malicious intent or security concern. These URL definitions are typical for API client configurations and pose no threat by themselves.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI agree with the assessments provided. The code is benign, and the scores are appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0",
