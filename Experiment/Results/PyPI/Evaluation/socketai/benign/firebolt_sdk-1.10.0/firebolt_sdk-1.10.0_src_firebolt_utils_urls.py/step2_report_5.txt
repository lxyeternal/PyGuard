  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is only defining static URL strings with placeholders.\n- No dynamic input handling, data processing, or network operations are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are detected.\n- The code appears to be a straightforward configuration of API endpoints.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; defines URL endpoints with placeholders.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; no malicious activity or security risk identified.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1 — reasonable.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; static URL strings.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; no malicious intent or risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1 — appropriate.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; URL definitions with placeholders.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; no anomalies or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1 — justified.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; static URL strings with concatenations.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; no signs of malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1 — reasonable.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; URL constants.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Recommendations:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis. No malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, consistent with straightforward string definitions.\n- **Security Risk Score:** All 0, justified given the static nature and lack of sensitive data handling.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**\n- Since the code is purely static URL definitions with no dynamic or untrusted data, the scores are appropriate.\n- The confidence level is 1 in all reports, which is justified given the clear and simple nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code snippet is benign, serving as a configuration of API endpoints. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities based solely on this snippet.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** I concur with the existing assessments. The scores are appropriate, and the code is safe. No changes needed.",
