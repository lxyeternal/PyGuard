  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or interaction, but without specific comments or context, its exact function is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input functions, environment variables, or file operations (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, system commands, file writes, or data transmission points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources through processing functions to sinks, potentially untrusted data reaching sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or unusual control flows detected. No obvious malicious behavior or backdoors present. Absence of suspicious network activity or data leaks.",
  "analysis": "A thorough review shows standard usage of Python features, with no signs of malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious modules. The code structure is straightforward, and no obfuscated constructs are observed. There are no indications of malicious payloads, such as data exfiltration, unauthorized network connections, or system damage commands.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. The code appears benign with a low malware score. Due to lack of context, confidence is high that the code is safe, with a security risk score indicating minimal threat.",
