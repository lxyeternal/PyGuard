  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of code and suspicious indicators, all reports' assessments are reasonable. The malware and obfuscated scores are justified as zero, and the low security risk score is appropriate. No evidence suggests malicious activity or obfuscation, and the confidence levels are suitable given the information constraints."
