  "anomalies": "Any hardcoded credentials, unusual dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious function usage.",
  "analysis": "Cannot perform a detailed analysis without specific code content. The review should focus on identifying source points (inputs), sink points (dangerous operations), and flow patterns. Check for obfuscated code, hidden dynamic execution, or unusual variable usage. Evaluate if any external data is being sent or received without clear purpose.",
  "conclusion": "Insufficient information provided to definitively identify malicious behavior. No obvious malicious patterns detected from the placeholder. Further detailed code review needed for a thorough assessment.",
