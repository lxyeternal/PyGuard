  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing or utility functions, but the specific purpose cannot be determined without detailed examination.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are not explicitly shown; possible sources could include environment variables, input functions, or external files if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands, but none are explicitly identified in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "No explicit source-to-sink data flows are identifiable from the available code segment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are detected. The code uses standard constructs and libraries without anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code lacks evident malicious patterns such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or unsafe operations. Usage of third-party libraries is not inherently suspicious. No insecure coding practices like SQL injection or insecure random number generation are apparent. There are no indications of obfuscation or malicious intent in the examined fragment. The overall structure appears to be straightforward and legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or significant security risks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious or malicious patterns identified.",
