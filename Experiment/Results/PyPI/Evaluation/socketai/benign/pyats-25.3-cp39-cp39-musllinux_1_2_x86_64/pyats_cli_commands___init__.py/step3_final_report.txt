{
  "purpose": "Evaluate open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided code snippets or summaries.",
  "sources": "Input data, code snippets, or summaries where code reads input, environment variables, network, or file I/O.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network transmissions, file modifications, or execution points where untrusted data could cause harm.",
  "flows": "Paths from data sources to sinks, indicating potential malicious data flow or security vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded secrets, suspicious network domains, obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or unusual patterns suggestive of malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "All reports lack actual code snippets, relying solely on summaries indicating benign behavior. Scores for malware and obfuscation are consistently zero, aligning with the absence of suspicious patterns. Security risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting cautious default but no evidence of threats. Confidence levels are high where detailed summaries are provided, slightly lower where data is limited. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are identified. The reasoning across reports is consistent and justified given the information.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided summaries, the code appears benign with no malicious or obfuscated elements detected. The low security risk scores are appropriate, and the malware scores are zero. Overall, the dependency shows minimal security concern under current information.",
