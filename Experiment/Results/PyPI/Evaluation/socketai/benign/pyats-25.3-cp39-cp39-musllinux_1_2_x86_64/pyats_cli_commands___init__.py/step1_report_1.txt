  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data processing or utility purposes, possibly involving network communication or data handling.",
  "sources": "Input sources may include environment variables, user input, or external data files; specific sources are not clearly identified in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, file write operations, or data transmission points, though explicit calls are not visible in the snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (such as environment variables or inputs) to sinks (like network or file operations), but detailed paths cannot be confirmed from the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are apparent; the code does not use obfuscated language features. No unusual code structures are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet lacks concrete details such as specific function calls, data handling logic, or network interactions, making thorough analysis difficult. No suspicious behaviors like dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or malicious data leaks are visible. The absence of malicious patterns suggests standard utility or processing functions without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, focused on data processing or utility functions without suspicious or harmful elements.",
