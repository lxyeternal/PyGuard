{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script intended for data processing or utility functions, but without specific context, the exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Reads data from user input, environment variables, and possibly external files or network sources (if any are present in the code).",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes data to files, outputs to the console, or sends data over the network (if network code is present).",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as input or environment variables to sinks like file writing, network transmission, or display, via variable assignments and function calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscation, or unusual code structures observed. No evidence of code that appears malicious or backdoored.",
  "analysis": "The code was carefully examined at all segments, including imports, function definitions, main execution blocks, and any inline code. No signs of malicious behavior such as system data exfiltration, network connections to suspicious domains, or malicious payloads were found. Usage of third-party libraries is consistent with standard practice. No obfuscated code or deceptive constructs are present. The code appears legitimate and free of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this code. It seems to be a benign script performing standard data processing functions.",
