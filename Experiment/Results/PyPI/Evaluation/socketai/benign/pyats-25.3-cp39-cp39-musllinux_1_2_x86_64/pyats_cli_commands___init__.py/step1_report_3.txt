{
  "purpose": "The code appears to implement a standard Python script that performs a specific task, possibly related to data processing or utility functions, without an immediately obvious malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly defined; the code does not seem to read data from external sources such as user input, files, or network connections.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks such as system commands, network transmissions, or file writes that could be exploited by untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "No clear source-to-sink data flows are identified; the code executes internal logic without external data dependencies or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are detected. The code structure appears standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is reviewed thoroughly and shows no signs of obfuscated patterns, malicious behavior, or security risks. It does not perform network communication, file manipulation, or sensitive operations that could indicate malicious intent. Usage of third-party libraries appears legitimate, and no hidden or malicious code segments are present.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is standard, and no anomalies or threats are detected.",
