  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report to verify the issues, their reasoning, and the assigned scores.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues present?** The report states the code is missing, so no issues can be confirmed.\n- **Errors or flaws?** The report correctly notes the lack of code, making detailed analysis impossible.\n- **Scores:** Confidence (0.3), malware (0), securityRisk (0.2). These seem reasonable given the lack of code.\n- **Justification:** The low confidence reflects uncertainty; malware and obfuscated scores are zero, consistent with the report's findings.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues present?** The report claims no malicious patterns are observable, citing straightforward code.\n- **Errors or flaws?** The reasoning is solid; the detailed analysis supports the benign conclusion.\n- **Scores:** Confidence (0.9), malware (0), securityRisk (0.1). These are appropriate; high confidence and low risk.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious activity is identified, and the code appears benign.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues present?** The report indicates insufficient detail to assess, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Errors or flaws?** The reasoning aligns with the lack of code; the cautious stance is justified.\n- **Scores:** Confidence (0.5), malware (0), securityRisk (0.2). Moderate confidence is reasonable due to incomplete info.\n- **Justification:** The low malware and risk scores are justified; the moderate confidence reflects uncertainty.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues present?** The report finds no evidence of malicious activity, citing minimal and benign code.\n- **Errors or flaws?** The analysis is thorough; no issues detected.\n- **Scores:** Confidence (0.7), malware (0), securityRisk (0.2). These seem appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The moderate to high confidence aligns with the benign assessment; low malware and risk scores are justified.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues present?** The report suggests no malicious patterns, noting the code appears standard.\n- **Errors or flaws?** The reasoning is sound; no suspicious activity identified.\n- **Scores:** Confidence (0.75), malware (0), securityRisk (0.2). These are consistent.\n- **Justification:** The high confidence matches the thorough analysis; low malware and risk scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware scores:** All are zero, consistent with the reports' conclusions of benign code.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are zero, matching the reports' observations of straightforward code.\n- **Risk scores:** Mostly low (0.1–0.2), justified by the lack of suspicious patterns and the incomplete nature of some reports.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\nGiven the consistent findings across all reports, I would assign the following scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, given the absence of suspicious activity)\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are generally consistent and cautious, appropriately reflecting the limited information.\n- No evidence suggests any malware or obfuscation.\n- The low risk scores are justified based on the provided analyses.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nI concur with the given scores. The overall security posture based on these reports appears benign, with no indications of malicious or obfuscated code, and minimal security risk.",
