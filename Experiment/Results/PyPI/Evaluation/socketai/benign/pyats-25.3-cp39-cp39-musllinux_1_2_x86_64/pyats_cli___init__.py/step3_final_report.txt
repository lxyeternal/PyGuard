  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input, environment variables, user inputs, file operations, network calls.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file writes, system commands, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks through data processing functions, network requests, or system calls.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "All reports lack actual code snippets, relying on assumptions. The reasoning in each is consistent, noting the absence of malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious activity. Confidence levels vary appropriately based on information completeness. Scores for malware and obfuscation are uniformly zero, and risk scores are low (~0.2), reflecting the benign assessment. No contradictions or errors are evident; the evaluations are cautious and justified given the limited data.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided reports, there is no evidence of malicious or obfuscated code, and the security risk remains very low. The scores are consistent with the reasoning and the absence of code snippets. Overall, the dependency appears benign, with no immediate security concerns.",
