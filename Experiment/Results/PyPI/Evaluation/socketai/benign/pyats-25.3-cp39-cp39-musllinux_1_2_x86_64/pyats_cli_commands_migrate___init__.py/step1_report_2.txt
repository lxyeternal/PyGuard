  "purpose": "Defines a CLI command for migrating to future versions of pyATS.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing modules and classes from relative and current packages.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data processing or potential data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; only static class attributes are set.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class definition for a command-line utility, inheriting from a base command class. It sets command name, help text, and subcommands via class attributes. No dynamic code execution, data input handling, or network operations are present. The imports are relative, likely within a larger codebase. No signs of obfuscated code or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard, benign CLI command setup with no malicious behavior detected. It simply registers a command with subcommands for migration purposes.",
