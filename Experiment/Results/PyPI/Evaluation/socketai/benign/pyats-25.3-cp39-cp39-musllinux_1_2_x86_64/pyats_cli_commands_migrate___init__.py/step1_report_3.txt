{
  "purpose": "Define a command class for migration utilities within a CLI framework.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules (`...base`, `.abstract`), class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no data processing or untrusted input handling observed.",
  "flows": "Initialization of class attributes and inheritance, no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, unusual code constructs, or suspicious behaviors present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes and defines a command class with static attributes for name, help message, subcommands, and an entry point. There are no functions performing dynamic code execution, data processing, or network communication. The structure appears standard for a command-line interface extension, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward class definition for CLI commands without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears safe and consistent with normal plugin or command module design.",
