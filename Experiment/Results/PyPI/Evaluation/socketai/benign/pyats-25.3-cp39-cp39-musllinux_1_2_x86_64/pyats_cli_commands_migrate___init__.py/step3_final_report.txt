  "purpose": "Define a CLI command class for pyATS migration utilities, registering subcommands and help info.",
  "sources": "Static class attributes (name, help, SUBCOMMANDS, SUBCMDS_ENTRYPOINT), import statements",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output, external communication, or dynamic code execution",
  "flows": "N/A; static definitions without data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "Absence of dynamic code, external data handling, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class definition for a CLI command within the pyATS framework, importing base classes and setting static attributes. No dynamic code, data processing, or external communication is present. The code is typical for CLI registration and does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, and confidence=1. There are no anomalies or signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign CLI command registration snippet with no malicious or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's static, straightforward nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
