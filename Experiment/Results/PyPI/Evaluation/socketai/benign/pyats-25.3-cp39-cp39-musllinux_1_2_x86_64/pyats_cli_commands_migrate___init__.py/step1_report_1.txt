  "purpose": "Define a CLI command for migration utilities in the pyATS framework.",
  "sources": "Import statements from relative modules; class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input/output points or external communication found.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present; code is defining static class attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports base command classes and defines a new command class 'MigrateCommand' with static attributes for command name, help text, subcommands, and entry point. There is no input handling, external data processing, or dynamic code execution. It appears to be straightforward command registration code. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code relies on imported modules and static attributes to function within a CLI framework.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard command definition for a CLI tool with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply registers a migration command with associated subcommands and metadata.",
