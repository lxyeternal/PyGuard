  "purpose": "Define a command with subcommands related to version management in a CLI application.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules and subcommand classes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily sets up class attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules and defines a class inheriting from CommandWithSubcommands, setting attributes for command name, help text, and subcommands. The structure appears standard for CLI command setup. No suspicious dynamic code execution, malicious imports, or hidden behaviors are present. No anomalous patterns or obfuscated code. The imports are relative, and the class defines configuration for subcommands without executing untrusted operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical CLI command definition for version management with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
