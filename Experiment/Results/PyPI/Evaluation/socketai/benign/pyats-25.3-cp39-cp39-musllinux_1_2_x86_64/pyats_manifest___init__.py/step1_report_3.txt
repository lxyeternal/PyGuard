{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script that performs data processing or utility functions, but the exact purpose is unclear due to lack of comments and context.",
  "sources": "Input is read from the environment variables and user input via the 'input()' function.",
  "sinks": "The code writes data to the console (print statements) and potentially to external systems or files if present; however, no explicit external data sinks are identified in the visible code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or user input to processing functions, and then to output or logging statements.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious functions are evident. The code contains standard Python functions without obfuscation or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code reads input from environment variables and user prompts, processes data via defined functions, and outputs results. There are no signs of malicious code such as network connections, file modifications, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The absence of external calls or dynamic code execution suggests low likelihood of malicious intent. The code structure appears standard, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears to be a benign utility script with no evident malicious or security-threatening components.",
