  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, external files/network, user input, data files.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, subprocess calls, file writes, system commands, environment variables.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data from sources to sinks, potentially leading to code execution or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), hardcoded URLs/credentials, redundant or complex expressions, unusual import patterns.",
  "analysis": "Most reports identify signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, with some code appearing benign or absent. The suspicion levels are justified by the presence of obfuscation and unsafe practices, but no concrete malicious payloads are confirmed. Scores reflect these observations: moderate malware suspicion (~0.2-0.3), high obfuscation (~0.75-0.8), and moderate security risk (~0.4-0.5). Benign reports correctly have minimal or zero scores. The reasoning across reports is consistent and appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The overall evaluation indicates low to moderate suspicion primarily due to obfuscation and dynamic code features, but no confirmed malicious activity. Scores are generally aligned with the evidence, with minor room for adjustment to better reflect suspicion levels. No significant changes are necessary; the assessments are sound.",
