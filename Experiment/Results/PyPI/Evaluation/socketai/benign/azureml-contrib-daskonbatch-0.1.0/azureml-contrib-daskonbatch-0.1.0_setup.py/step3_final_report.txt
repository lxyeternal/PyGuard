  "purpose": "Standard Python setup configuration script defining package metadata, dependencies, and entry point.",
  "sources": "Static data within setup() parameters; no dynamic input or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no execution of untrusted data or code; entry point references a function but does not execute code directly within this script.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual URL pointing to a YouTube channel unrelated to the package purpose; description states timezones but package name suggests a different function; no dynamic code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with static metadata, dependencies, and an entry point. The URL is suspicious due to its unrelated content, which could be misleading or used for social engineering, but it does not execute malicious code. No obfuscation, code injection, or malicious behavior is present. The entry point 'src.main:main' could execute arbitrary code if malicious, but without inspecting that module, this remains speculative. The package dependencies are benign. Overall, the code appears benign but with metadata inconsistencies that warrant caution.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign with no evidence of malicious code or obfuscation. The main concern is the suspicious URL and metadata mismatch, which could be used for social engineering but does not constitute malicious activity. The security risk is minimal but slightly elevated due to metadata inconsistency. Malware and obfuscation scores are zero; risk score should be around 0.1 to reflect the minor concern.",
