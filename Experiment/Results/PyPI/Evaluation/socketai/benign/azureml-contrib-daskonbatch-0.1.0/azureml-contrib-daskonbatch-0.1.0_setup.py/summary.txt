  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign with no evidence of malicious code or obfuscation. The main concern is the suspicious URL and metadata mismatch, which could be used for social engineering but does not constitute malicious activity. The security risk is minimal but slightly elevated due to metadata inconsistency. Malware and obfuscation scores are zero; risk score should be around 0.1 to reflect the minor concern."
