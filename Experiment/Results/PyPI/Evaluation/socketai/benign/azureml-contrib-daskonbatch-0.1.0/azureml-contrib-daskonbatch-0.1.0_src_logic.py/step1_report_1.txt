{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to display the current time for a given location or time zone, using the pytz library for timezone conversions.",
  "sources": "User inputs via function arguments (location and zone), and the code reads from the pytz.all_timezones list.",
  "sinks": "Print statements output formatted time data to the console; no data is sent externally.",
  "flows": "Input location/zone -> functions process and map to timezones -> datetime.now(tz) -> formatted string -> print output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. Usage of a dictionary for timezone aliases appears normal. No obfuscated or malicious constructs identified.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard library functions and the pytz library to handle timezone conversions. It includes functions for formatting location strings, matching user input to known timezones, and handling daylight saving time zones. The data flow involves user input being mapped and then used to generate current time data, which is printed to the console. No external network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors are evident. The use of a simple dictionary for timezone aliases is typical for handling common DST zones. The code does not contain any code injection, data leakage, or malicious commands.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward timezone utility with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It safely maps locations and time zones, formats current datetime, and outputs to the console. No malware or security risks are identified.",
