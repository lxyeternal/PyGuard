  "purpose": "The code provides functions to display the current time for a given location or timezone, handling daylight saving time adjustments.",
  "sources": "Input data from function arguments 'location' and 'zone'.",
  "sinks": "None that lead to data leaks or external effects; only prints formatted time information.",
  "flows": "User inputs are processed, potentially mapped to timezone strings, then used to get current datetime objects, which are formatted and printed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious data exfiltration or system modification activities observed.",
  "analysis": "The code converts location strings into timezone identifiers, retrieves current datetime for those timezones, and outputs formatted timestamps. It uses standard libraries and a custom timezone mapping function. There are no external network connections, no handling of sensitive data, and no dynamic code execution. Exception handling is broad but limited to printing error messages, which does not pose a security risk. The code appears to serve a straightforward timezone conversion purpose without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard timezone conversion utility with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. The overall security risk is minimal.",
