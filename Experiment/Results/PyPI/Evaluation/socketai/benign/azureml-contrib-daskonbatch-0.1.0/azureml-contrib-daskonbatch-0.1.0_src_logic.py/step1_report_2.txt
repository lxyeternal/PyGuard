  "purpose": "The code provides functionality to retrieve and display the current time for a given location or time zone, handling daylight saving time adjustments and formatting location strings.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'location' in 'area', 'zone' in 'area_zone', and 'zone' in 'timezones'; data from 'pytz.all_timezones' and 'datetime.now()'.",
  "sinks": "Print statements that output formatted time strings and error messages.",
  "flows": "User inputs 'location' or 'zone' → functions process and map to pytz time zones → datetime fetches current time in the specified zone → formatted time is printed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no suspicious or misleading code. Exception handling is broad but benign. No external network calls or data exfiltration. The code only prints output.",
  "analysis": "The code securely handles timezone conversions using the pytz library, with straightforward mapping and formatting. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior observed. Exception handling is generic but does not conceal malicious intent. No suspicious external network activity or backdoors. The function 'timezones' simply maps known abbreviations to standard time zones, with no dangerous operations. The overall logic is benign and intended solely for time display functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a harmless utility for displaying local and specified timezone times. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or malware. It does not perform any unauthorized system actions or data exfiltration.",
