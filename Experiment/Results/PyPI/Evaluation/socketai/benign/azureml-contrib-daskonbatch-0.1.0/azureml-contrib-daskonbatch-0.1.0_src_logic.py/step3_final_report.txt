{
  "purpose": "This code provides timezone conversions and displays current times for specified locations or zones using the pytz library.",
  "sources": "User input location string processed in format_location; the zone parameter in area_zone; internal dictionary in timezones.",
  "sinks": "Print statements outputting formatted current time; no untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks or external systems.",
  "flows": "Input location or zone -> format_location or timezones mapping -> pytz.timezone -> datetime.now -> formatted string -> print",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad exception handling in area_zone; reliance on print statements instead of return; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward timezone utility that uses standard libraries and simple data structures. It maps location strings to pytz timezones, handles some DST abbreviations, and prints current times. No network activity, data exfiltration, hardcoded credentials, or malicious payloads are present. The broad exception handling in area_zone is benign but could be refined. The code's purpose is benign, and no suspicious behavior or obfuscation is detected. The malware score is 0, as there is no malicious intent. The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is clear and readable. The security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting minimal security concern given the benign nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, safe timezone utility with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The assigned malware score of 0 and low security risk score are appropriate. The broad exception handling does not introduce security vulnerabilities. Overall, the code poses negligible supply chain security risk.",
