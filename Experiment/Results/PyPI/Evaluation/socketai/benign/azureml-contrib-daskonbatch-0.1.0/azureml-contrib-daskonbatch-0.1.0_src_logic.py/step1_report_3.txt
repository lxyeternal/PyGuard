{
  "purpose": "Provide time zone information and formatted current time based on user-inputted location or time zone.",
  "sources": "User input via function parameters, static data within functions (e.g., list of time zones).",
  "sinks": "Standard output via print statements; no direct data leak or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Input (location or zone) -> format_location / timezones -> pytz.timezone -> datetime.now -> print output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no malicious data leaks or backdoors. No insecure data handling or code injections detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily deals with time zone conversions and formatting. It uses user input to determine the timezone, with fallback mechanisms and mappings for daylight saving time zones. No external data is transmitted or stored insecurely. There are no signs of malicious code such as network communications, data theft, or system manipulation. The use of print statements for output does not pose security risks. The code appears well-structured for its purpose without suspicious anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for time zone conversion with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not include any malicious behavior such as data exfiltration or system sabotage.",
