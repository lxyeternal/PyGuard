{
  "purpose": "Provides a command-line interface for querying time zone information based on location and zone inputs.",
  "sources": "Input parameters '--location' and '--zone' provided via command line options.",
  "sinks": "Calls to 'area()' and 'area_zone()' functions with user input; potential data handling or external interactions depending on these functions.",
  "flows": "User input '--location' flows into 'area(location)'; '--zone' flows into 'area_zone(zone)'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or obfuscated code observed. No apparent malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a CLI using 'click' that accepts 'location' and 'zone' parameters, then passes these inputs to functions imported from 'src.logic'. The functions 'area' and 'area_zone' are external, so their behavior is unknown. There is no evident malicious behavior or insecure practices in the command handling code itself. The code appears straightforward, focusing on user input processing and delegation to external functions.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions as a simple CLI interface to other modules. No malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious anomalies are detected within this code fragment. Its security posture depends on the implementation of 'area()' and 'area_zone()'.",
