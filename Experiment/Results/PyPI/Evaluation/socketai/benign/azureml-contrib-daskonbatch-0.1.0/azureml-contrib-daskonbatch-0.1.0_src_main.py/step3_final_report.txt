{
  "purpose": "A simple CLI wrapper that accepts location and zone inputs and delegates processing to external functions.",
  "sources": "User inputs '--location' and '--zone' options; passed directly to 'area()' and 'area_zone()' functions.",
  "sinks": "External functions 'area()' and 'area_zone()' may process inputs; potential for data leaks or malicious actions depends on their implementation.",
  "flows": "Input options are received, then directly passed to external functions without validation; no further data flow within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal CLI interface that forwards user inputs to external functions. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. Security concerns hinge on the unknown implementations of 'area()' and 'area_zone()'. The code itself does not perform any harmful actions or contain vulnerabilities. Scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with this benign assessment. The high confidence score (0.9) reflects the straightforward nature of the code. Overall, the code appears safe, with the main risk being the security of the external functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and straightforward. No malicious intent or obfuscation detected. Security risk is minimal, contingent on external functions' security. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
