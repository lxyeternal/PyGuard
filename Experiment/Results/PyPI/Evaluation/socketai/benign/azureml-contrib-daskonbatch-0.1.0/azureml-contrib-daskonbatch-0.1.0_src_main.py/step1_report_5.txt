  "purpose": "Provide a command-line interface to query time information based on location and timezone.",
  "sources": "Input options '--location' and '--zone' received from command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Function calls to 'area' and 'area_zone' which may process or display data.",
  "flows": "User inputs '--location' and '--zone' flow into 'main', which then calls 'area(location)' and 'area_zone(zone)' respectively.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual code structures. Usage of third-party 'click' library is standard for CLI apps.",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple CLI wrapper that takes user input for location and timezone, then calls external functions 'area' and 'area_zone'. No data is sent over networks, no data is leaked, and no suspicious operations are present. The functions called are imported from 'src.logic', which are not shown here, but their invocation does not indicate malicious behavior in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward CLI application for time zone queries with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
