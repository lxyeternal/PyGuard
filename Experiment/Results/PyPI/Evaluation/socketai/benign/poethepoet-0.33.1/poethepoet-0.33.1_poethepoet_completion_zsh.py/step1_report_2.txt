{
  "purpose": "Generates a zsh completion script for the 'poe' CLI application based on its argument parser configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments, module imports, and object attributes (e.g., parser options, _action_groups, _group_actions).",
  "sinks": "Outputs a shell script string that defines a zsh completion function and uses 'poe _list_tasks' subprocess calls.",
  "flows": "Parses CLI options to generate completion rules; calls 'poe _list_tasks' to populate task list for autocompletion.",
  "anomalies": "Uses dynamic code (e.g., nested functions, string joins), accesses internal parser attributes (e.g., _action_groups, _group_actions), which could be manipulated, but this is typical for CLI completion scripts; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious external calls observed.",
  "analysis": "The script dynamically constructs a zsh completion function based on the argument parser configuration, including handling mutually exclusive options and special options like help and version. It calls 'poe _list_tasks' to fetch task completions, which is part of normal CLI behavior. No external network calls besides subprocess invocations, no hardcoded credentials or secret leaks, and no obfuscated code detected. The dynamic nature of the code appears intentional and standard for generating shell completion scripts. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present; the code appears to serve a legitimate purpose of providing CLI autocompletion support.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate script generator for zsh CLI autocompletion for the 'poe' command. It constructs the completion script by inspecting the parser and invoking 'poe _list_tasks' to dynamically populate task options. No malware, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.",
