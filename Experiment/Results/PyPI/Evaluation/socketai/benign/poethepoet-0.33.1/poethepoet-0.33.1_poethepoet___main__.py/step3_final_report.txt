  "purpose": "Python CLI entry point that delegates execution to 'poethepoet.main()' and exits with its return code.",
  "sources": "Importing 'main' from 'poethepoet' module.",
  "sinks": "Calling 'main()' function, which executes external package code.",
  "flows": "Code reads input during import and execution of 'main()'; no data flows from untrusted sources within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and execution pattern, no obfuscation or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard Python script serving as an entry point. It imports 'main' from 'poethepoet' and runs it under the '__main__' guard, then exits with its return code. No suspicious or malicious constructs are present. The security concern depends on 'poethepoet's' implementation, but the script itself is benign. Malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is low (~0.1), reflecting minimal security concern. The code's simplicity and standard pattern support these assessments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard CLI launcher with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified based on the code's straightforward nature.",
