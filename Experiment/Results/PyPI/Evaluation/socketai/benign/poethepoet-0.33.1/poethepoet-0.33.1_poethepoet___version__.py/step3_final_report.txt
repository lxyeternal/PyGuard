  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to the __version__ variable in a Python package.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no untrusted data sinks or external communications.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code is a simple assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard version declaration in Python. It involves no input/output, data processing, or external communication. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present. The code does not pose any security threat or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments and scores are accurate and should remain as is.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
