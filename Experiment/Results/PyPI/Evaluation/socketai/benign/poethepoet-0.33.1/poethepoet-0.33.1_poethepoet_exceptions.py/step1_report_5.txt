{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a Python application, with additional context-specific attributes for some exceptions.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs, only class definitions and initializations.",
  "sinks": "No potential data leaks, security-sensitive operations, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks; the code only initializes exception objects.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; standard exception class definitions with some attribute handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes inheriting from RuntimeError and PoeException. The constructors set attributes, handle optional arguments, and format messages. No dynamic code execution, external data handling, or security-sensitive operations are present. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior indicators are identified. The code is purely structural, focusing on error representation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely for error handling within an application, with no external data processing or security vulnerabilities.",
