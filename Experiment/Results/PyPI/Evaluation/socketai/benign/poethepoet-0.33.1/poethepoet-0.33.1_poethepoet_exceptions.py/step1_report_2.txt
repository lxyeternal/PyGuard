  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various error conditions in a Python application.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; the code defines classes and constructors.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data output.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow involving untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions, with typical constructor methods initializing attributes. No data input, external calls, or risky operations are present. The use of optional attributes and passing of arguments is standard for exception handling. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious logic, or suspicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials or external network activity.",
  "conclusion": "This source code purely defines exception classes for error handling and contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It is standard application code without suspicious or malicious intent.",
