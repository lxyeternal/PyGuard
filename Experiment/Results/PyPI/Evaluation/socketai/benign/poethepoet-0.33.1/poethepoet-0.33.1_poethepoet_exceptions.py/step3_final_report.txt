{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom exception classes for error handling, including PoeException and its subclasses, with optional cause and context attributes.",
  "sources": "Class constructors that process message and optional cause or context attributes.",
  "sinks": "No data input/output, network activity, or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Construction of exception objects with message and optional cause; no data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, with constructors managing message passing and optional attributes. There are no external data inputs, network calls, or security-sensitive operations. The cause attribute formatting is standard, and no obfuscation or malicious code is present. The code is straightforward and typical for error handling in Python, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely structural for exception handling, with no security risks or malicious behavior. The provided reports correctly identify the absence of malware, obfuscation, and security concerns. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
