  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read directly in this code.",
  "falls": "No untrusted data flows or security-sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code primarily defines classes and constructors.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are detected. The code only defines exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, with no data processing, external input handling, or network operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for exception handling and does not contain any malicious or security-threatening elements. It is safe and appears to be a standard implementation of custom exceptions.",
