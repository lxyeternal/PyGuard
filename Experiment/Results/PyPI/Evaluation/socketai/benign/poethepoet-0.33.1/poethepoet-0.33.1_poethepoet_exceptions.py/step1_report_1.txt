  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling within a Python application.",
  "sources": "None, no data input or external data reading present.",
  "sinks": "None, no data output, network, or external effects.",
  "flows": "None, no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements identified.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from RuntimeError and PoeException. The constructors handle error message passing and optional cause/error context. There are no external data inputs, network operations, or security-sensitive actions. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic are present. The code is straightforward and purely for exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is purely for error handling and does not perform any dangerous or suspicious operations.",
