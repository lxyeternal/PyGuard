  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the potential security implications, scores, and consistency.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is solely defining custom exception classes.\n- No external data input, network activity, or file operations are present.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.\n- The code appears to be straightforward, well-structured, and typical for error handling in Python.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Summary:** Correctly states that the code is standard exception class definitions with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent; no issues.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Summary:** Same as above, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** All zero, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate and consistent.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Summary:** Again, consistent with previous assessments.\n- **Scores:** All zero, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** No issues.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion; purely class definitions.\n- **Scores:** All zero, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** No concerns.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Summary:** Same; no malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** All zero, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final Analysis:\n- **Code presence:** The code is purely class definitions for exceptions, with no external or sensitive operations.\n- **Malware risk:** Zero across all reports, consistent with the code.\n- **Obfuscation:** Zero, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** Zero, no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n- **Scores:** All reports appropriately assigned zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with high confidence.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The cause attribute handling in `PoeException` involves formatting messages with optional cause details, but this is standard practice and not suspicious.\n- No signs of code obfuscation, malicious payloads, or backdoors.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nBased on the code and reports provided, **the current scores are appropriate and justified**. The code is safe, non-malicious, and standard for exception handling.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** No malicious or suspicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code is purely structural for error handling.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always ensure that exception classes are used appropriately within the larger application context, but based solely on this code snippet and reports, there are no security concerns.",
