{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for a Python application, including additional context and error information.",
  "sources": "No external data sources, input, or environment variables are read or used.",
  "sinks": "No data or untrusted input is being written to external systems, files, or network resources.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows or execution paths involving untrusted data are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code only defines several custom exception classes inheriting from RuntimeError or PoeException, with optional attributes to store detailed error information. There are no external inputs, network operations, or file I/O. No data is transmitted or manipulated in a way that could lead to security issues. The design appears to be for error handling within a larger application. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious side effects are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for defining exception classes to handle errors within an application. It contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. It is safe and non-malicious.",
