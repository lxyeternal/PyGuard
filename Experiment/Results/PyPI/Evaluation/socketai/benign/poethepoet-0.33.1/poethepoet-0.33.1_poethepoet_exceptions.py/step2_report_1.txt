  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n\n- The code defines several custom exception classes inheriting from RuntimeError and PoeException.\n- No external data input/output, network activity, or obfuscated/malicious code is present.\n- The logic is straightforward, focusing on error message handling and optional context attributes.\n- All reports agree that there are no security risks, malware, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Observations:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code?**  \n   - The code is purely class definitions for exceptions; no functional or security-sensitive logic exists.\n   - No vulnerabilities, data leaks, or malicious behavior can be inferred from the code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic?**  \n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as standard exception class definitions.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given:**  \n   - All reports assign:\n     - malware: 0\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5?**  \n   - No reason to assign high risk scores; the code is purely structural and for error handling.\n   - The reports' assessments are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**  \n   - No malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present.\n   - Malware score of 0 is correct.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions?**  \n   - All reports are cautious and base their conclusions on the code's content, not assumptions.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**  \n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- The code is standard, with no security issues or malicious intent.\n- The detailed attribute handling in exceptions does not introduce vulnerabilities.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (confirmed)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (confirmed)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (confirmed)\n\n**Additional notes:**  \nGiven the code's simplicity and the thoroughness of the reports, I agree with the provided scores. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\nThe code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**End of review.**",
