  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for managing and verifying Python virtual environments, including path resolution, existence checks, and environment variable setup.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (os.environ), filesystem checks (Path.is_dir, Path.is_file, Path.glob), and system platform info (sys.platform).",
  "sinks": "Uses shutil.which() for executable resolution, modifies environment variables in get_env_vars, and performs filesystem access for validation.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and filesystem checks influence path resolution and environment setup functions; no external network data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors detected. The code performs standard filesystem and environment operations without suspicious side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to implement standard virtual environment management routines: path verification, executable resolution, environment variable configuration, and detection of virtual environments. No signs of data exfiltration, malicious command execution, or hidden backdoors are evident. Usage of os.environ and Path operations are typical for such utilities. The functions are straightforward and do not perform any suspicious activities such as network connections, cryptomining, or data theft.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical utility for managing Python virtual environments. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain threats. It appears safe and standard in its operations.",
