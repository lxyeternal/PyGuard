  "purpose": "This code manages and interacts with Python virtual environments, including verifying their existence, locating executables, and setting environment variables.",
  "sources": "Reads from sys.platform, os.environ, and filesystem paths (via Path objects and globbing).",
  "sinks": "Uses shutil.which to locate executables, manipulates environment variable dictionaries, and checks for files and directories.",
  "flows": "Reads platform and environment variables; verifies existence of files/directories; constructs environment variable dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. No suspicious network or system calls. The code is straightforward and uses standard library functions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured approach to manage virtual environments, including verifying their structure and setting environment variables. It relies on platform-specific paths and standard file existence checks. There are no signs of code injection, data leaks, or malicious behavior. The use of shutil.which for executable lookup is standard. Environment variable handling appears normal and appropriate for virtual environment setup. The code does not include any obfuscated or suspicious code patterns, nor does it perform any network or system modifications beyond typical environment setup tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for managing Python virtual environments without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. Overall, it is safe from a supply chain security perspective.",
