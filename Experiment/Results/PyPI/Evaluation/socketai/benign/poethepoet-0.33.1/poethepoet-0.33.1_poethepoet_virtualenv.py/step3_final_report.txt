  "purpose": "Manage and validate Python virtual environments, resolve executables, and set environment variables for activation.",
  "sources": "Filesystem checks for virtual environment structure, environment variables (PATH, PYTHONHOME), and executable files in bin/Scripts directories.",
  "sinks": "Environment variable modifications affecting the current process environment, filesystem access for validation and executable resolution.",
  "flows": "Filesystem checks and path resolutions lead to environment variable setup and validation routines, with no external network or data leakage involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard filesystem and environment variable handling. No obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard virtual environment management tasks: detecting venv directories, validating structure, resolving executables, and setting environment variables. It uses common Python libraries and filesystem operations without any suspicious patterns. No network activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The logic is straightforward and aligns with typical practices. Scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign, utility nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for managing Python virtual environments, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. The low risk and malware scores are appropriate, and the code can be considered safe for use.",
