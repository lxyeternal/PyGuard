  "purpose": "Manages task environment, handles stdout data, and creates executor instances for task execution within a framework.",
  "sources": "Environment variables via EnvVarsManager, stdout bytes from tasks, configuration objects for executor setup.",
  "sinks": "Decoding stdout bytes, instantiating PoeExecutor objects, applying environment configurations.",
  "flows": "Reads environment configs and stdout bytes, processes stdout with fallback encoding, passes data to executor creation methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious imports detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, handling environment setup, stdout decoding, and executor instantiation in a standard manner. No network activity, data exfiltration, or dynamic code execution is present. The stdout decoding with fallback encoding is safe and common. Environment variables are managed via a dedicated class, and executor creation relies on configuration data without executing untrusted code. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure implementation of a task context manager with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low risk score accurately reflects its benign purpose.",
