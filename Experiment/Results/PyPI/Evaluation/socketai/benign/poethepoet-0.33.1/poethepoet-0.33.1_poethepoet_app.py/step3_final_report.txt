  "purpose": "This code defines a CLI-based task management class that handles configuration, user input, environment variables, and task execution flow.",
  "sources": "CLI arguments, configuration files, environment variables, user prompts",
  "sinks": "Output to stdout/stderr, task execution calls, error handling",
  "flows": "User input and configs flow into task resolution and execution, with outputs and errors as results",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured CLI task runner that manages configuration loading, task resolution, and execution. It uses standard libraries and patterns, with no network activity, code injection, or obfuscated code. Environment variables are accessed but only for configuration purposes. No malicious payloads or backdoors are present. The code's logic is straightforward, and the external task implementations are assumed trustworthy.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured CLI task management class with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
