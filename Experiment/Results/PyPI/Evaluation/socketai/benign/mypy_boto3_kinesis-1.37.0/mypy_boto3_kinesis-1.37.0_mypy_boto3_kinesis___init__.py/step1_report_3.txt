{
  "purpose": "Provide a main interface and documentation for interacting with the Kinesis service via boto3 stubs and custom classes.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client, .paginator, .waiter), inline comments, and documentation strings.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data handling or external effects are present.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow analysis as no runtime data processing or untrusted input handling is implemented.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs. The code mainly consists of imports, variable assignments, and documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a wrapper and interface definition for the Kinesis client, including imports, type annotations, and documentation. No data input, no network communication, no credential handling, and no suspicious code segments are present. The code does not perform any operations beyond defining class aliases and exporting symbols. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The license, usage examples, and module structure are typical for a client library interface.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign interface module providing documentation and class aliases for a Kinesis client library. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
