  "purpose": "Main interface for the Kinesis service, providing imports and type aliases for interacting with AWS Kinesis streams.",
  "sources": "Code reads static module imports, documentation, and type annotations; no external input or user data handling observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data flows to security-sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules, assigns type aliases, and exposes symbols; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines module imports, type aliases, and documentation. It includes no runtime logic, input handling, or external data processing. All components appear to be standard, intended for modular access to Kinesis client functionality. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard interface module for AWS Kinesis with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is purely structural and documentation-oriented.",
