  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, reasoning, and scoring:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports conclude that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious intent.\n- The code is primarily a wrapper or interface module, consisting of imports, type aliases, documentation, and export definitions.\n- No data processing, network activity, input handling, or secret management is present.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or anomalies are detected.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Interface for Kinesis, no suspicious code.\n- **Analysis:** Accurate; the code is straightforward.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct; no issues.\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar, with emphasis on documentation.\n- **Analysis:** Also accurate; no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1.\n- **Note:** The security risk is minimal; the report's score seems reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Correct; no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.\n- **Note:** Consistent and appropriate.\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Re-exporting classes, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Analysis:** Accurate.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.\n- **Note:** Correct.\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Similar, no suspicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** Correct.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.\n- **Note:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Mostly zero, with one report at 0.1, which is reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**\n- No report overstates the risk; all are consistent.\n- The minimal security risk score (0.1) in report 2 is justified, given the code's harmlessness.\n\n---\n\n### **Final estimation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected or implied).\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code).\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security issues present).\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and their scoring is appropriate. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is a benign, standard interface module for AWS Kinesis SDK components. The malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores should all remain at **0**.",
