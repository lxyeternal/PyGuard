  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Interface for AWS Kinesis, no data processing.\n- Sources/Sinks: No data flow, no untrusted data.\n- Anomalies: None, code appears standard.\n- Analysis: Simple imports, documentation, no malicious activity.\n- Conclusion: Benign, no security issues.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Interface with documentation.\n- Sources/Sinks: No untrusted data, no external communication.\n- Anomalies: Future-dated copyright, but not malicious.\n- Analysis: Imports and documentation only, no suspicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Standard wrapper, no security risks.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — the small risk score might be slightly overestimated given the benign nature, but it’s still very low.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Main interface for Kinesis.\n- Sources/Sinks: No data flow, no network activity.\n- Anomalies: None detected.\n- Analysis: Purely a wrapper with no runtime logic.\n- Conclusion: Benign, no security concerns.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Interface layer for AWS Kinesis.\n- Sources/Sinks: No untrusted data or external effects.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Import/export module, no malicious code.\n- Conclusion: Standard, benign.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Interface with documentation.\n- Sources/Sinks: No data flow or external communication.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Structural, no runtime logic.\n- Conclusion: No malicious behavior.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code is purely an interface/wrapper with no embedded malicious logic.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly note no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the absence of any suspicious activity, data leaks, or security issues, the risk scores should generally be zero or very close to zero.\n\n**However,** the only minor point is Report 2’s securityRisk of 0.1, which seems slightly overestimated given the benign nature. I would recommend setting the risk score to 0 for consistency, as there are no vulnerabilities or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis: the code is a straightforward, documentation-oriented interface module with no malicious or risky behavior.",
