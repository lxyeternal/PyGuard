{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a Python module providing an interface to AWS Kinesis SDK components, primarily through imports, type aliases, and documentation. It facilitates usage of AWS Kinesis services without implementing any data processing or network logic.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules and defines type aliases; no untrusted input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code does not process or transmit data.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only re-exports classes and defines aliases without runtime data movement.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a future-dated copyright year (2025), which is unusual but not malicious; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward interface module wrapping AWS SDK components for Kinesis, with documentation and type aliases. It contains no data processing, network communication, or credential handling. No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected. The minor anomaly of a future date does not impact security. The code's structure and content are benign, and the scores reflect this: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 (due to the date anomaly).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK wrapper with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The minor security risk score of 0.1 is justified but does not indicate any real threat. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
