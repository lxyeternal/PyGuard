{
  "purpose": "Provide an interface for interacting with AWS Kinesis service, including access to client, paginators, and waiters.",
  "sources": "No explicit input or data reading points; relies on external AWS SDK and user-provided parameters.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed; no direct output or data leaks.",
  "flows": "N/A – No source-to-sink data flows present; primarily interface definitions and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors detected; code structure appears standard and documentation-oriented.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports and re-exports components for the Kinesis service. It defines a client alias, specifies exports, and includes comprehensive docstrings with usage examples. There are no embedded inputs, no data processing, no command execution, and no network or file operations. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present. The code appears to be an interface layer for AWS SDK components, with no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign interface module providing access to AWS Kinesis SDK components. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The structure and content are standard for such SDK wrappers or interface modules.",
