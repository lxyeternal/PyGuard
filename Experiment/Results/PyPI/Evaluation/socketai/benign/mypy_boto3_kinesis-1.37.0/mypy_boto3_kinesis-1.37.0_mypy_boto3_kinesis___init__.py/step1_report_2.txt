{
  "purpose": "Provides an interface for interacting with AWS Kinesis service, including import statements and documentation for usage.",
  "sources": "Reading of standard library imports, module-level string documentation, and import statements from local modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data transmission; no user input or environment variables are processed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only imports modules and sets up type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior detected. The copyright date appears future-dated but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of module documentation, import statements, type aliasing, and an explicit list of exported symbols. There are no input handling, network operations, or executable logic that could be exploited maliciously. All imported modules are local or part of a well-known SDK, with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation present. No sensitive information or secret keys are embedded. The presence of a future date in the copyright notice is unusual but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This module serves as an interface layer for AWS Kinesis SDK components, with no evident malicious code, data leaks, or security risks. It is a standard, well-structured wrapper around SDK components without suspicious behavior.",
