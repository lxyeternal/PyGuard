  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Interface for AWS Kinesis SDK components.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious code, no data processing, no external effects. It’s a straightforward wrapper with documentation.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0. The confidence is perfect (1).\n- **Assessment:** Fully benign. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar interface layer with documentation.\n- **Analysis:** No data flows, no untrusted input, no suspicious patterns. The only notable point is the future date in the copyright.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1. The security risk is slightly above zero, possibly due to the future date being unusual but not malicious.\n- **Assessment:** Still benign, but the minor security risk score is acceptable given the documentation-only nature.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Main interface and documentation.\n- **Analysis:** No data processing, no network, no credential handling. Standard wrapper code.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0. The report confidently states benign intent.\n- **Assessment:** No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Provides interface for Kinesis client, with usage examples.\n- **Analysis:** No runtime logic, no data flow, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Clearly benign.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Main interface with type aliases.\n- **Analysis:** No data handling, no malicious patterns, purely structural.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports describe code that is purely an interface or wrapper around AWS SDK components.\n- No embedded malicious code, no obfuscation, no suspicious behavior.\n- The only minor point is the future date in the copyright, which is not malicious.\n- The malware score remains at 0 across all reports, consistent with their analyses.\n- The security risk scores are either 0 or very low (0.1), which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n- No changes needed; the reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- The malware score should remain at 0, and the obfuscated score at 0.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (or possibly 0.1 if considering the future date anomaly, but 0 is acceptable)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, safe SDK interface module with no malicious or security issues detected.",
