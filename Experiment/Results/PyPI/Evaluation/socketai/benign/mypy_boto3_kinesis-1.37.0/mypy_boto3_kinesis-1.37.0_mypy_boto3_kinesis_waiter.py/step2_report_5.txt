  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, reasoning, and score appropriateness.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as straightforward, well-documented, type-annotated subclasses of botocore.waiter.Waiter for Kinesis stream waiters.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code is detected.\n- The code is primarily class definitions, imports, and documentation with no external data processing or network activity.\n- The reports assign malware scores of 0, security risk scores of 0, and confidence of 1.0.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Logical Checks:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, the code is a typical type stub module for boto3 waiters.\n- **Errors, flaws, mistakes:** None apparent; the code follows standard patterns, uses conditional imports correctly, and includes helpful documentation.\n- **Scores assigned:**\n  - Malware: 0.0 — consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n  - Obfuscated: 0.0 — no obfuscation detected.\n  - Security risk: 0.0 — no security issues or vulnerabilities.\n  - Confidence: 1.0 — justified given the thorough, benign nature of the code.\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- The use of `Unpack` with conditional import based on Python version is standard practice.\n- The classes inherit from `Waiter` and override `wait()` with type annotations, which is typical for type stubs.\n- No external data, secrets, or network operations are involved.\n- Documentation links are for reference, not code execution.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware or malicious intent?** None detected. The code is purely structural, aimed at type safety and documentation.\n- **Obfuscation?** No, the code is clear and standard.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities?** No, the code does not handle untrusted data or perform external operations.\n- **Scores consistency:** The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the provided reports and code:**\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain **0.0** — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain **0.0** — code is clear.\n- **Risk score:** Should be **0.0** — no security risks.\n\n**My own estimate aligns with the reports:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0.0     | 0.0          | 0.0   |\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a benign, well-structured type stub module for AWS Kinesis waiters. No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed; the reports are accurate and thorough.",
