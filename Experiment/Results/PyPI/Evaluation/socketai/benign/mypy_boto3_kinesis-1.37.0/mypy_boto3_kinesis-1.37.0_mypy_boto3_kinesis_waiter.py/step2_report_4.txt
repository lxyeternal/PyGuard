  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward, well-documented set of type annotations and class wrappers for boto3 Kinesis waiters.\n- No external data, network operations, or data processing are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns are identified.\n- The code primarily consists of class definitions, imports, and documentation links.\n- The use of conditional imports based on Python version is standard and safe.\n- No suspicious behaviors or anomalies are detected across all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Discrepancies:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code defines subclasses of `Waiter` with overridden `wait()` methods accepting typed kwargs, which aligns with typical boto3 stub patterns.\n- **Malware or malicious activity:** None of the reports identify any malicious constructs, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Obfuscation:** Not present.\n- **Security risks:** None identified; the code is purely structural/type annotation focused.\n\n---\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0.0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0.0 or 0.1, indicating negligible or no security risk, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Note:** Since the code is purely structural and documentation-oriented, a risk score higher than 0.1 would be unwarranted.\n\n---\n\n### Potential Issues or Clarifications:\n\n- **Type annotations:** The use of `Unpack[...]` is conditional based on Python version, which is correct and standard.\n- **Functionality:** The `wait()` methods do not implement additional logic but are intended to provide type annotations and documentation, which is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0.0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** **0.0** (no security risk)\n\n**Overall, the code appears safe, benign, and correctly implemented as a type stub for boto3 waiters.**\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n| Score Type     | Final Estimated Score | Justification                                                      |\n|----------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0.0                     | No malicious code or behaviors detected                            |\n| Obfuscated     | 0.0                     | Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation                     |\n| Security Risk  | 0.0                     | No vulnerabilities, secrets, or suspicious activity present       |\n\nPlease let me know if further detailed analysis or specific focus areas are needed.",
