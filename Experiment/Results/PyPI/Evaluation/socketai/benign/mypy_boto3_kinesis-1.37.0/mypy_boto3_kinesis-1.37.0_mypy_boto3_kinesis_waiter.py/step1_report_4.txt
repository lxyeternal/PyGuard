{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and waiter class definitions for AWS Kinesis service client waiters, facilitating type-checked interactions with boto3 waiters.",
  "sources": "Import statements from sys, botocore.waiter, and local type_defs; class methods defining wait behavior.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data is processed or transmitted to external sources or untrusted inputs within the code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code defines classes and methods without data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The code primarily contains class definitions, imports, and docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of typed waiter classes inheriting from botocore.waiter.Waiter. It includes conditional imports based on Python version, detailed docstrings linking to documentation, and type annotations for method signatures. No external data input, no data processing, nor any network or file operations are present. The code appears to be purely structural and documentation-focused, with no signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured module providing type annotations and class wrappers for AWS Kinesis waiters. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
