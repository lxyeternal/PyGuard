  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as straightforward, consisting of class definitions, type annotations, and documentation links.\n- No external data handling, network operations, or data leaks are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code relies on standard practices like conditional imports based on Python version.\n- The purpose is to provide type safety and documentation for boto3 waiters, with no malicious intent.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of malicious code or malware:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is benign, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n   - The scores for malware are consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n2. **Obfuscation:**\n   - The code is clear, well-structured, and documented.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, which is appropriate.\n\n3. **Risk scores:**\n   - The reports assign a security risk of 0, which seems reasonable given the benign nature.\n   - The confidence scores are high (mostly 1.0), indicating certainty in the benign assessment.\n\n4. **Any inconsistencies or unreasonable scores?**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis. Since there's no malicious or suspicious activity, the risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.\n   - The only point to consider is whether the risk score should be slightly higher due to the presence of class inheritance and type annotations, but given the context, these are standard and safe.\n\n**Challenging assumptions:**\n- The reports assume the code is purely structural and documentation-focused, which appears correct.\n- No assumptions about potential vulnerabilities are justified, as the code doesn't process external data or perform risky operations.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (confirmed benign)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks detected)\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- Considering the detailed analysis and the absence of any suspicious elements, I agree with the current scores.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a safe, well-documented, type annotation module for AWS Kinesis waiters.\n- No changes needed to the scores.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate, and the overall security assessment should remain at zero risk.",
