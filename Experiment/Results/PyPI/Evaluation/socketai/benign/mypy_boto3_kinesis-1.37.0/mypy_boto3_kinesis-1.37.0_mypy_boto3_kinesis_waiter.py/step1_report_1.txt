{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and waiters for AWS Kinesis service client, facilitating structured waiting for stream existence or non-existence.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, botocore.waiter, and local type_defs; no user input or external data sources present.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling, network communication, or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "N/A; code defines class structure and method signatures without data flow or external effects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present. The code primarily consists of class definitions, imports, and documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and third-party libraries, defines two subclasses of Waiter with overridden wait methods, and includes detailed documentation links. No external data inputs or outputs are manipulated. No signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are detected. The presence of type annotations and class inheritance appears standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a straightforward, well-documented type annotation module for AWS Kinesis waiters. It contains no malicious or suspicious code and appears safe for use. No security risks or malware are detected.",
