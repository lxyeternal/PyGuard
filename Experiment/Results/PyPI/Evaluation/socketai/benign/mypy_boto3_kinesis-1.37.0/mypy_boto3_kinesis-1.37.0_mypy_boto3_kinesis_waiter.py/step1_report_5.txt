  "purpose": "Type annotations and waiter class definitions for Kinesis service client waiters to facilitate type-safe waiting on stream existence or non-existence.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, sys, botocore.waiter, .type_defs, input parameters in wait() methods",
  "sinks": "wait() method calls and usage of **kwargs for passing parameters to superclass methods",
  "flows": "Input kwargs -> wait() methods -> superclass Waiter.wait()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. Use of sys.version_info for conditional imports is standard. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines type-safe subclasses of botocore.waiter.Waiter for Kinesis stream waiters, adding type annotations and documentation links. No data is read from untrusted sources; no untrusted input is used. The wait() methods are simply passing kwargs to the parent class, with appropriate type annotations. The conditional import based on Python version is standard practice and does not pose a security concern. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The code is straightforward, documentation-focused, and appears to be an open-source type stub implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, documentation-oriented implementation of waiter subclasses with type annotations for improved type safety. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured type stub for boto3 waiters.",
