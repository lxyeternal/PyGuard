  "purpose": "Type annotations and class definitions for Kinesis service waiters, providing structured waiters with documentation and type safety.",
  "sources": "Class inheritance from botocore.waiter.Waiter, conditional imports for Unpack, and method signatures with **kwargs.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, network calls, or external data processing present.",
  "flows": "wait() methods accept **kwargs with specific types, but do not process external data or perform external actions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, well-documented, and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines subclasses of Waiter with type annotations, conditional imports for Python version compatibility, and documentation links. No external input, network activity, or data leaks are present. The code is purely structural, serving as a type stub for boto3 waiters. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and free of security concerns. The existing reports accurately assess the code as safe with no malicious intent or obfuscation. No improvements or corrections are necessary.",
