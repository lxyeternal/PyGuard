  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, potential security implications, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n\n- The code is a set of class definitions extending `botocore.waiter.Waiter`, with type annotations, documentation links, and conditional imports for Python version compatibility.\n- No external data input, network communication, or data leaks are present.\n- The code appears to be a straightforward, well-documented, type-annotated module for AWS Kinesis waiters.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior are detected.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code matches its purpose—defining subclasses for waiters with type annotations.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected; no network, file I/O, or external data manipulation.\n- **Obfuscation:** None; the code is clear and standard.\n- **Security risks:** None apparent; no secrets, no code injection, no backdoors.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, and risk scores as 0 or 0.0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Clear; type annotations for waiters.\n- **Analysis:** No anomalies; code is standard.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.0, obfuscated 0.0, risk 0.0. Appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above; standard class definitions.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.0, obfuscated 0.0, risk 0.0. Appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Similar; type annotations for waiters.\n- **Analysis:** No external data or malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.0, obfuscated 0.0, risk 0.0. Appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** No anomalies.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.0, obfuscated 0.0, risk 0.0. Appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.0, obfuscated 0.0, risk 0.0. Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** Since the code is purely structural, with no external inputs or vulnerabilities, a risk score of 0.0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\nGiven the thorough review and consistent scoring:\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code is benign, well-structured, and free of security concerns. The scores reflect this accurately.",
