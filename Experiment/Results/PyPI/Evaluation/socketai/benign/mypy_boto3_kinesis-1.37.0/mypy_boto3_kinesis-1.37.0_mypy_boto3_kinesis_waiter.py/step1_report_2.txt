  "purpose": "Type annotations and waiter class definitions for the Kinesis service client, providing structured waiters for stream existence checks.",
  "sources": "Import statements from sys, botocore.waiter, and local type definitions; class method definitions with type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code primarily defines classes and method signatures without data processing or external data flow.",
  "flows": "Class methods 'wait' receive keyword arguments annotated with type definitions; no data flows from sources to sinks or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. The code follows standard patterns for type annotations and class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for waiters, with type annotations that adapt based on Python version. It imports necessary modules and defines classes with 'wait' methods. There are no external data inputs, no data leaks, no code injection, or malicious logic present. The use of sys.version_info for conditional imports is standard practice. Overall, the code appears to be a typical, benign type definition file for boto3 waiters.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign type annotation and class definition file for boto3 Kinesis waiters. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no data leaks, and no security risks. It is a typical implementation focused on providing type safety and documentation links.",
