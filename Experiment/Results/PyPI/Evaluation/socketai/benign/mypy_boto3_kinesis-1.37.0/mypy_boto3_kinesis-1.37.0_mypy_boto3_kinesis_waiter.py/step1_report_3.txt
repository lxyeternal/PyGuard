  "purpose": "Type annotations and waiters for the Kinesis service client to facilitate wait operations in boto3 with type hints.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class method definitions, and type annotations that accept kwargs with specific types.",
  "sinks": "The wait methods, which invoke underlying waiters, but do not process untrusted input directly.",
  "flows": "kwargs passed to wait() methods flow from caller to the underlying Waiter.wait() function, but are strongly typed and controlled.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs detected. The code is primarily type annotations and class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two waiter classes for boto3's Kinesis client, adding type annotations and docstrings referencing external documentation. No user input, network operations, or file manipulations are present. The methods accept kwargs with specified types, which are passed to the Waiter.wait() method. No malicious or suspicious code patterns are detected. No obfuscation, malicious data handling, or backdoors are evident. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured type-annotated wrapper for boto3 waiters.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, type-annotated wrapper for boto3 waiters in the Kinesis service. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The design is straightforward, focused on type safety and documentation.",
