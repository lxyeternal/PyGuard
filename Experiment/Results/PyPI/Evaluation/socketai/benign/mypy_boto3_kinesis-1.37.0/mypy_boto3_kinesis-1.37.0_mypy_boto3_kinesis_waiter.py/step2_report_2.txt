  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports describe the same source code: a module defining two subclasses of `botocore.waiter.Waiter` (`StreamExistsWaiter` and `StreamNotExistsWaiter`) with type annotations, documentation links, and straightforward `wait()` method signatures.\n- The code involves conditional imports based on Python version, standard class inheritance, and no external data handling.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- The purpose across all reports is consistent: providing type annotations and structured waiters for AWS Kinesis streams.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n\n1. **Code presence and correctness:**\n   - The code defines classes `StreamExistsWaiter` and `StreamNotExistsWaiter` inheriting from `Waiter`.\n   - The `wait()` methods are correctly annotated with `**kwargs` of specific types, and they call the superclass method.\n   - Conditional import of `Unpack` based on Python version is standard.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n   - No evident logical errors.\n   - The code is purely structural, focused on type annotations and documentation.\n   - No data leaks, network calls, or external data processing.\n\n3. **Scores given in reports:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as zero.\n   - The confidence scores are high (1.0), which seems appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n4. **Malware and obfuscation:**\n   - No malware activity or obfuscation detected.\n   - The code is transparent, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n5. **Potential vulnerabilities:**\n   - The code is purely structural, with no user input, external data, or network activity.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are warranted here.\n\n6. **Consistency:**\n   - All reports are consistent in their assessment.\n   - The detailed documentation links and class structures reinforce the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0.0** — no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.0** — code is clear, standard, and well-documented.\n- **Risk score:** **0.0** — no security risks identified.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The code is a typical type stub module for boto3 waiters, with no suspicious or malicious features.\n- The high confidence scores are justified.\n- The use of conditional imports and class inheritance is standard practice.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the detailed review, **I concur with the reports' assessments**. The code is safe, well-structured, and free of malicious or obfuscated content.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the thorough analysis provided.",
