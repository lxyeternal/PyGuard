{
  "purpose": "This setup script configures the packaging and distribution of the mypy-boto3-kinesis library, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; static strings for package metadata and URLs; import statements; dependencies specified in install_requires.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that process untrusted data or execute external commands; no code that takes user input or untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the script primarily defines package configuration data without dynamic data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors detected. The code is a standard setup script with proper static configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script imports Path and setuptools, reads a README file for description, and calls setup() with static package metadata. No dynamic code execution, no input processing, and no network or system manipulation is present. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns identified. All data used is static, and no external commands are invoked. The overall structure follows typical Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not process untrusted input, execute system commands, or include malicious payloads. It appears to be safe and purely for packaging purposes.",
