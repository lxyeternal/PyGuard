{
  "purpose": "Standard setup script for Python package 'mypy-boto3-kinesis', defining metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file for long description; static metadata and URLs; no external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or system calls; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md into variable, passes static data to setup(); no dynamic or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected; straightforward static code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python library. It reads a local README file and calls setup() with static metadata, dependencies, and URLs. No dynamic code execution, external data processing, or suspicious behavior is present. The code is clear, well-structured, and adheres to standard practices. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are detected. The external URLs and email are standard for open-source projects. All signals indicate benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard Python package setup configuration with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are accurate and consistent with the code content.",
