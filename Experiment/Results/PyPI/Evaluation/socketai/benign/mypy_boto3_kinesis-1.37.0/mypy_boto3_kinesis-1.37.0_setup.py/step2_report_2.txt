  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script.\n- No dynamic code execution, external data processing, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code only reads a local README file and calls `setup()` with static metadata.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Evaluations:\n\n**Presence of issues in the code:**\n- The code matches the description: a typical `setup.py` for a Python package.\n- No anomalies, suspicious code, or security risks are present.\n- The code is static, straightforward, and adheres to common packaging practices.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n- No logical errors or mistakes are evident.\n- The code is correct for its purpose.\n\n**Scores assigned:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, correct given the code clarity.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0 or 0.5, but since no issues are present, 0 is justified.\n\n**Potential points of contention:**\n- The reports uniformly assign a confidence of 1, which is reasonable given the straightforward nature.\n- No reason to increase the malware or obfuscated scores.\n- The risk score could be debated, but given the absence of issues, 0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0 — no security risks or vulnerabilities identified.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n**Overall, I agree with the assessments provided.** The code is a standard, benign setup script with no security concerns.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code review.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, standard, and free from malicious or obfuscated elements. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
