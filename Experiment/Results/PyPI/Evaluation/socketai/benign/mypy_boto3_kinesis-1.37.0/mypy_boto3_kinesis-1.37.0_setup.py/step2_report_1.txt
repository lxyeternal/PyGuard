  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports agree that the script is a standard Python package setup script.\n- They confirm that it reads a local README.md file for the long description.\n- They note that the script only defines static metadata, dependencies, URLs, and package data.\n- No untrusted input, external data processing, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or signs of malicious intent are observed.\n- All reports assign a confidence level of 1, with malware and security risk scores of 0.\n\n**Confirmations and Validations:**\n- The code is a typical setup.py script, with no code that processes external data beyond reading a local file.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are present.\n- No network or system commands are invoked.\n- The dependencies and URLs are standard and do not suggest malicious intent.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n**Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n- The reports rely on static analysis; they do not detect any hidden malicious payloads that might be embedded elsewhere or in dependencies.\n- The only external file read is 'README.md', which is standard.\n- The URLs and email are typical for open-source projects and do not raise suspicion.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Based on the provided code and reports, there is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- The code is a straightforward, benign setup script.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.",
