{
  "purpose": "The script sets up the package 'mypy-boto3-kinesis' for distribution, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file for the long description; all other data is hardcoded within the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no external data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading the README.md file into the long_description variable, then into the setup() function, which does not execute external code or user input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward setup script without obfuscated or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded credentials or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, reads a documentation file, and calls setuptools.setup() with static project metadata. There are no dynamic code executions, no network operations, or data leaks. It is a standard setup script for Python packaging, with well-defined and typical use of the setuptools library. All data appears to be static and safe. No malicious behaviors or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security concerns. It contains no hidden or suspicious behavior, external data transmission, or obfuscated code.",
