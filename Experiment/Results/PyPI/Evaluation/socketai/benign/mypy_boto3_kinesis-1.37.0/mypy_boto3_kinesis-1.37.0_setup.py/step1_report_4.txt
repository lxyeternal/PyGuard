  "purpose": "The script is for setting up a Python package named 'mypy-boto3-kinesis', including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads the file 'README.md' for the long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external outputs present.",
  "flows": "Reads local file content to assign to LONG_DESCRIPTION, then passes configuration parameters to setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors detected. The code is straightforward setup logic.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and setuptools for package setup. It reads a local README file for long description. The setup() call defines package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, URLs, and package data. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or credential handling present. The code is typical for a Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It performs package configuration tasks securely and transparently.",
