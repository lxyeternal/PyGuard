  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is a standard Python `setup.py` script for packaging, with no dynamic code, user input, or external data processing.\n- All reports correctly identify that the script reads a local README.md file and calls `setup()` with static metadata.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present.\n- The dependencies and URLs are typical and do not raise concerns.\n- The email address and URLs are standard, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly states the script's purpose and finds no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Justification:** Fully aligned with the code. No issues.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Also correctly describes the script as benign and standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Justification:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same as above; confirms no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Justification:** Consistent with the code.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly identifies the script as a typical setup script.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Justification:** Fully aligned.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same as others; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Justification:** Consistent with the code.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, correctly reflecting the straightforward, clear code.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- The code is a standard, well-structured setup script with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior.\n- All scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.\n- No modifications are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code poses no security threat.",
