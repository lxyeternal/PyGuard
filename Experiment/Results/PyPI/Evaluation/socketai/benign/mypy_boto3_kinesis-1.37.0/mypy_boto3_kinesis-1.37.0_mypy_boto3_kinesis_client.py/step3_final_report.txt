{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definitions for the AWS Kinesis SDK, serving as a type-safe interface with no data handling or malicious logic.",
  "sources": "Method parameters and class attributes that define the SDK interface; no external or untrusted data sources are processed.",
  "sinks": "Method signatures accepting parameters that could be used in API calls; no actual data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "Method parameters flow into SDK calls; no untrusted data is processed within this code, as it only defines interfaces.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a standard SDK stub with method signatures, no executable logic, no embedded code, and no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of type annotations, method signatures, and class definitions for the boto3 Kinesis client. It contains no runtime logic, data processing, or external input handling. The presence of methods like 'generate_presigned_url' is typical for SDK interfaces and does not indicate malicious intent. The code is static, purely structural, and auto-generated for type safety and documentation purposes. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, auto-generated SDK interface with no signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation. The scores for malware and obfuscation are correctly set to 0. The slight risk score (0.1) in some reports reflects potential misuse in API parameters but does not indicate actual malicious behavior. Overall, the code is safe and purely structural.",
