{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface for the AWS Kinesis service, providing method signatures and exception handling for interaction with Kinesis streams.",
  "sources": "Import statements for dependencies, class attribute definitions, and method parameters which unpack data types from imported type definitions.",
  "sinks": "Method implementations invoke AWS SDK functions; no direct sinks for untrusted data identified within this code.",
  "flows": "Method parameters (unpacked from type defs) potentially accept external input; these are passed to AWS SDK calls which are not included here, so flow is only in the method signatures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No use of insecure practices or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured, annotated client class for AWS Kinesis, mainly providing method signatures, type annotations, and documentation links. No code performs data processing, network connections, or external data handling within this snippet. The imports and class structure are standard for a generated or stubbed AWS client interface. The presence of type definitions, overloads, and exception classes is typical for SDK stubs and does not suggest malicious intent. No suspicious logic, hidden behaviors, or security issues identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical SDK interface definition for AWS Kinesis with type annotations and no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a well-structured, non-malicious stub or client class for interacting with the AWS SDK.",
