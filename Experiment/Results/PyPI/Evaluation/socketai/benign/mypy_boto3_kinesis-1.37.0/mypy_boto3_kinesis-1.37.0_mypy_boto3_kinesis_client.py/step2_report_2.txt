  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a standard SDK interface with type annotations, no malicious logic, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues found; malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0, justified by the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, accurate.\n- **Overall:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it recognizes the code as a type stub for SDK support, with no malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malware or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0, consistent.\n- **Overall:** Well justified.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, it correctly states that the code is a non-malicious, type-annotated interface.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.95 (though not explicitly, the report indicates high confidence in benign nature).\n- **Note:** The report states confidence 0.95, but the risk score is not explicitly given. Since the code is benign, the risk should be low, e.g., 0.0 or 0.1 at most.\n- **Adjustment:** The high confidence in benignity suggests the risk score should be 0.0 or 0.1, not higher.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Describes the code as a type stub with no executable logic, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0, consistent.\n- **Overall:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to others, no malicious behavior, only method signatures.\n- **Note:** The report mentions a `securityRisk` of 0.1, citing potential for external input in parameters, but the code does not process or execute any data; it merely defines interfaces.\n- **Justification:** Given that the code is purely type annotations and method signatures, and no data handling or execution, the risk should be minimal.\n- **Adjustment:** The `securityRisk` of 0.1 seems overstated. It should be 0, unless there's a specific concern about misuse, which isn't evident here.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign SDK interface code.\n- The malware scores are appropriate at 0 for all reports.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, consistent.\n- The risk scores are mostly justified at 0, except Report 3 and 5, where they are slightly higher (0.95 and 0.1 respectively). Given the nature of the code, these should be lowered to 0.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Adjust the risk score for Report 3 from 0.95 to 0.0** — the code is a benign SDK stub.\n- **Adjust the securityRisk in Report 5 from 0.1 to 0.0** — no actual risk present.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk, no data handling, no malicious activity)\n\n**Overall:** The code is a standard, type-annotated SDK interface with no malicious or security concerns.",
