{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definitions for the AWS Kinesis service SDK, facilitating type-checked API calls.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore modules, and internal type definitions. No direct data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "Method implementations that pass parameters to AWS SDK calls. No explicit sinks that handle untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "Method parameters flow from function calls into SDK methods; no evidence of malicious data flow or injections.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of standard SDK interface definitions; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns identified.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard SDK client class with type annotations, method signatures, and documentation links. It imports modules, defines a subclass of the AWS SDK base client, and specifies method signatures with type hints. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code is purely for type safety and client interface purposes. No data handling, external inputs, or suspicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign SDK interface definition for AWS Kinesis, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It serves as a type-safe wrapper for SDK calls, with no embedded malicious intent.",
