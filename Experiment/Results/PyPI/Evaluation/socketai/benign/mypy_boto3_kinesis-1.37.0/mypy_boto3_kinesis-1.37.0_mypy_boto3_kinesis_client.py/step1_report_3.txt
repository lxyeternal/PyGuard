{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface for interacting with AWS Kinesis service, providing type hints and documentation references.",
  "sources": "Imports from botocore, system version checks, type definitions, and method implementations with parameters.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data or user input handling that leads to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Method parameters flow from input to AWS API calls; no evidence of malicious data manipulation or malicious data flow patterns.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code structures, or obfuscated code. The code primarily defines an interface with type annotations and method signatures.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a type-annotated client class for AWS Kinesis, including method signatures, exception classes, and paginator/waiter overloads. It imports standard AWS SDK components and Python type hinting modules, with version-based imports to maintain compatibility. No suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious commands are present. The implementation appears to be a straightforward, well-structured type stubs and interface definitions for a client library.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a non-malicious, structural definition of a Python client for AWS Kinesis, intended for type safety and documentation. It contains no signs of malware or security risks. The code's purpose is to facilitate correct API usage with type hints and documentation links, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
