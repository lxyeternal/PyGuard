{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface definitions for interacting with AWS Kinesis service using boto3, intended to provide type safety and documentation support.",
  "sources": "Import statements for system info, typing, and boto3-related modules; class and method definitions including properties, overloads, and method signatures.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks or untrusted data handling observed. Methods primarily define API call signatures and type annotations without processing untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks; the code mainly defines interfaces and method signatures for API calls without actual data processing or handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic; code appears to be auto-generated stub definitions for AWS service client with standard type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of type annotations, class definitions, and method signatures for the boto3 Kinesis client. It includes import statements, version-based conditional imports, class property definitions, and method overloads for creating paginators and waiters. No data processing, dynamic code execution, or untrusted input handling is present. The presence of copyright info and documentation links suggests a generated or template-based code structure for SDK support, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a type-annotated interface for AWS Kinesis client in Python, with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity detected. It is a standard SDK stub with no signs of malware or security risks.",
