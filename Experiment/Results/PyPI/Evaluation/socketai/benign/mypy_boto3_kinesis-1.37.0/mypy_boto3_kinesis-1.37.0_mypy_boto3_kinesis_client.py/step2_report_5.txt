  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes type annotations and class definitions for the SDK client. No data input sources or external data handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No evidence of untrusted data being processed or malicious flow.\n- **Anomalies:** Standard SDK interface, no suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a benign, type-safe SDK interface with no malicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code content. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on type annotations and SDK interface.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data handling or malicious flow.\n- **Anomalies:** Looks auto-generated, standard SDK stub.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity; purely a type annotation layer.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Fully consistent; no concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, SDK interface with type hints.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing involving untrusted sources.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard SDK stub, safe, no malicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** The conclusion is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type annotations, method signatures, documentation links.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** The only potential concern is `generate_presigned_url`, which involves URL generation based on parameters.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or malicious code, just a stub.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a benign stub; the URL generation method is standard and controlled by the user, not malicious.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious activity; the mention of `generate_presigned_url` is standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** SDK interface with method signatures.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Methods accept external input that could be used to make API calls.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a typical SDK stub; no malicious behavior, but the report notes a slight security risk (0.1) possibly due to the potential misuse of methods like `generate_presigned_url`.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** The slight security risk is justified if considering misuse, but no actual malicious code is present.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Code Content:** All reports agree that the code is a standard, auto-generated SDK interface with type annotations, no embedded malicious logic.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports indicate malware score = 0, and obfuscated code = 0.\n- **Security Risks:** Slightly elevated in report 5 due to potential misuse of URL generation, but no actual malicious activity detected.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The **malware score** should remain at **0** across all, as no malicious code or backdoors are present.\n- The **obfuscated score** should stay at **0**.\n- The **risk score** could be slightly increased for report 5 (from 0 to 0.1) due to the potential for misuse, but given the context, it remains low.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to potential misuse, but no active malicious code)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign, well-structured SDK stub with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The slight security risk in report 5 is acknowledged but does not indicate actual malware or malicious intent.",
