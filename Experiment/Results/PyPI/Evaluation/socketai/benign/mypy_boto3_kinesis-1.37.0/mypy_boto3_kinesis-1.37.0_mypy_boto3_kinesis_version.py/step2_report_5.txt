  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully and systematically.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code.**  \nAll reports agree that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__`, with no dynamic behavior, input/output, or external dependencies. The code is minimal, standard, and contains only comments and a version string.  \n**Conclusion:** No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are present.\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports' logic or reasoning.**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify the code as benign, with no suspicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. No logical errors are evident.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned to each issue.**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.  \n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no malicious intent.  \n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature.  \n- **Confidence:** All reports have a confidence of 1, which is justified given the straightforwardness of the code.\n\n**Step 4: Justify higher risk scores.**  \nSince the code is purely a static version string assignment with no dynamic or external interactions, there's no basis for assigning a higher risk score.\n\n**Step 5: Challenge any claims based on assumptions.**  \nNo assumptions are made in these reports that need challenging; all are consistent with the code's actual content.\n\n**Step 6: Ensure score consistency.**  \nScores are consistent across reports and aligned with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### My own estimate:\n\nGiven the analysis, I concur with the reports' conclusions. The code is standard, benign, and poses no security threat.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a typical version declaration snippet, with no issues or risks.",
