  "purpose": "Defines the version of the package or module.",
  "sources": "Assignment of the string to __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; simple assignment operation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward version declaration, no obfuscated or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a comment about the source of truth for version and a single assignment of a version string to the __version__ variable. No external data sources, input handling, or dynamic code execution are present. The comment is a standard practice for versioning and does not pose security risks. The code is minimal and typical for Python package versioning.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware or obfuscation and poses no security threat.",
