All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0. The code contains no malicious payload, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version declaration with no security concerns or malicious intent. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain at zero.",
