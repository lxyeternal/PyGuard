  "purpose": "Defines a version string for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "The assignment of the __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or input sources are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; simple assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hidden logic, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment, a copyright notice, and a straightforward assignment of a version string to the __version__ variable. There are no external inputs, no data processing, no network calls, or dynamic code execution. The code appears to serve as a metadata descriptor for the package version only.",
  "conclusion": "This is benign metadata code with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply assigns a version string, which is common in Python packages.",
