  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__`, with no dynamic behavior, external inputs, or suspicious code. The code is minimal and standard for version declaration. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no anomalies or malicious intent. No logical flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.  \n   - **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis.  \n   - **SecurityRisk:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n   The scores seem reasonable and justified based on the code's content.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.5, which is correct. The code is just a version string declaration, a common pattern with no security implications.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is accurate. There is no malicious behavior, payload, or suspicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports are cautious and do not assume vulnerabilities where none exist. They recognize the code as benign.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report content:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard, static version declaration with no dynamic behavior, external inputs, or malicious content. The reports are thorough and correctly identify the benign nature.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code poses no security threat. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is safe and standard.  \n- No changes needed in the scores.  \n- The overall security posture is benign.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
