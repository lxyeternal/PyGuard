  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is primarily for type annotations and class definitions for boto3 Kinesis paginators. It notes the absence of malicious activity, external data flows, or security risks.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.9\n- **Justification:** The high security risk score (0.9) seems excessive given the benign nature. The code is static, purely for type hinting, with no external or unsafe operations. A more reasonable risk score would be around 0.1, reflecting minimal concern.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** The report similarly finds no malicious behavior, just complex typing logic and standard class structures. It notes the use of conditional typing and ignore comments but considers these typical.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n- **Justification:** The risk score aligns well with the analysis; no issues here.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** The report confirms the code is a standard, type-safe paginator implementation with no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0\n- **Justification:** Appropriate; the code is purely for type annotations and class structure.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** The report states the code is benign, focusing on type annotations and class hierarchies, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0\n- **Justification:** Correct; the code is safe.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to others, it confirms the code is for type annotations, with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0\n- **Justification:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, mainly for type annotations and class structures.\n- The only inconsistency is in **Report 1**, which assigns a very high security risk score (0.9) despite clear evidence of benign, static code.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** All should be 0, as there's no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All should be 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** For Report 1, reduce from 0.9 to about 0.1 to reflect the benign nature.\n- For others, 0 is appropriate.\n\n### Overall estimated scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (mainly for Report 1, others at 0)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, well-structured type stub for boto3 Kinesis paginators with no security risks or malicious intent. The high risk score in Report 1 is unwarranted and should be lowered.",
