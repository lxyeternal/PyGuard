  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, consistency, and scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward set of type annotations and class definitions for boto3 Kinesis paginators, with no malicious activity or security risks detected.\n- **Details:** No suspicious code, data leaks, or obfuscation. The code is primarily for type safety and documentation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.9 (though the report states 0), confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The report's conclusion aligns with the code content.\n- The securityRisk score is marked as 0.9, which seems high given the benign nature described. Since no vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are present, a lower score (e.g., 0.1) would be more appropriate.\n- The malware score is correctly 0.\n- The code does not contain obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n**Recommendation:** Reduce the securityRisk score to 0.1 to reflect the low risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing type safety, no malicious behavior, with complex typing logic due to conditional imports.\n- **Details:** No data leaks, external data flow, or malicious code. The complexity is typical for type hints.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code is benign, and the reasoning is sound.\n- The securityRisk score of 0.1 is appropriate, considering the conditional typing logic, which is standard.\n- Malware is correctly 0.\n\n**Recommendation:** The scores seem consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard, type-safe paginator class setup with no malicious intent.\n- **Details:** No external input, network activity, or data leaks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns.\n- The securityRisk score of 0 aligns with the analysis.\n- Malware is correctly 0.\n\n**Recommendation:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports—type annotations, class definitions, no malicious behavior.\n- **Details:** No external data flow, obfuscation, or security issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The analysis is consistent; the code is benign.\n- The scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—benign, type-safe paginator classes, no malicious activity.\n- **Details:** No suspicious patterns or security concerns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The report's conclusion and scores are consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify malware as 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly identify obfuscation as 0.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Most reports assign a low but non-zero risk (0.1) due to complex typing logic and conditional imports, which is reasonable. However, since the code is purely for type annotations and class structure, **a score of 0** would be more accurate to reflect the negligible risk.\n- **Confidence:** Appropriately high across all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Adjust the securityRisk score to 0** in all reports, as the code is benign and primarily for type annotations.\n- **Maintain malware and obfuscated scores at 0.**\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n\nThis reflects the benign, well-structured nature of the code, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a legitimate, well-structured set of type annotations and class definitions for boto3 Kinesis paginators, with no malicious or security concerns. The scores should be adjusted to reflect a minimal or zero security risk.",
