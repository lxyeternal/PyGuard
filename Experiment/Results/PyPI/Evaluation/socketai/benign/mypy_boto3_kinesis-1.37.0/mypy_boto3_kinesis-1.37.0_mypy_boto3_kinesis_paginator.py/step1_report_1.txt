  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for the AWS Kinesis client, enabling type-safe pagination in Python.",
  "sources": "Constant imports, sys.version_info check, class method parameters, and type definitions imported from type_defs.",
  "sinks": "None identified. No untrusted data sources or dangerous sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Method parameters unpacking into paginator methods; no data flows to external systems or insecure operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are detected. The code appears structured for type hinting and documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and conditionally imports 'Unpack' for Python >= 3.12. It defines paginator classes for different Kinesis operations, using type annotations for clarity and type safety. All classes inherit from generic Paginator types, and the paginate methods are properly annotated with input types and return PageIterator. The code is primarily for type hinting, documentation, and class structure without executing malicious or unsafe operations. No suspicious dynamic code, network calls, or data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, structured set of type annotations and class definitions intended to support type checking and documentation for boto3 Kinesis paginators. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
