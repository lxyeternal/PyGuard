  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator classes for the boto3 Kinesis service, enabling type-safe pagination of Kinesis API responses.",
  "sources": "The code reads import data from sys, typing, and boto3's paginators, and uses type definitions from a local module. It does not process external input directly.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any data sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions; it mainly defines classes and methods for pagination.",
  "flows": "The code defines class methods that accept kwargs unpacked with specific type annotations and return PageIterator objects, without executing or transmitting data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are present. The code appears to be standard, well-structured type annotation code for boto3 paginators.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple paginator classes for the boto3 Kinesis client, with appropriate type annotations and conditional imports based on Python version. It imports necessary modules and defines class hierarchies that extend boto3's Paginator class, adding paginate methods with proper type annotations. The purpose is to facilitate type-safe pagination of AWS Kinesis API responses. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident; the code is straightforward and appears to be generated or maintained for type safety and clarity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of paginator class definitions with type annotations for boto3 Kinesis service, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security issues.",
