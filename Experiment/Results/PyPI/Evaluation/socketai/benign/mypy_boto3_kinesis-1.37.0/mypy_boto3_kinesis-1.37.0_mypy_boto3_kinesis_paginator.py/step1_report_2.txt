  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator classes for the boto3 kinesis client, enabling type-checked pagination over Kinesis resources.",
  "sources": "Import statements from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs; class methods using **kwargs with Unpack for input parameters.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data sinks or external data flows are present.",
  "flows": "Method 'paginate' receives untrusted input via **kwargs and returns PageIterator objects; no external data is read or written.",
  "anomalies": "Use of type: ignore comments, dynamic class inheritance based on type checking, and conditional import of Unpack suggest complex typing logic, but do not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code is found.",
  "analysis": "The code defines paginator classes for boto3 Kinesis client with appropriate type annotations, conditional imports for Python version compatibility, and no evident malicious behavior. The code appears to serve solely as type-safe wrappers for pagination, following standard patterns. No suspicious code, backdoors, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are detected. The only complexity involves conditional typing and ignore comments, which are typical in type hinting practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, type-annotated paginator implementation for boto3 Kinesis, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate, well-structured typing stub module.",
