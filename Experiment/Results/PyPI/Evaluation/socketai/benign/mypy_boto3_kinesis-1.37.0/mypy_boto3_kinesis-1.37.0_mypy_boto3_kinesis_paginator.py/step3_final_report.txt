{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and class definitions for boto3 Kinesis paginators, serving as static type hints and documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type definitions; class method signatures with type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No external data sources, network operations, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Class inheritance and method signatures define source-to-sink flow; no runtime data flow or external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, well-structured set of type annotations and class hierarchies for boto3 Kinesis paginators. It uses conditional imports for type compatibility, defines paginator classes with 'paginate' methods, and includes documentation links. No external data processing, network activity, or malicious code is present. The code's purpose is purely for type safety and IDE support, with no security risks or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard type stub for boto3 Kinesis paginators, with no malicious intent or security issues. The high security risk score in the initial report (0.9) is unwarranted; it should be adjusted to 0.1 or 0 to accurately reflect the negligible risk.",
