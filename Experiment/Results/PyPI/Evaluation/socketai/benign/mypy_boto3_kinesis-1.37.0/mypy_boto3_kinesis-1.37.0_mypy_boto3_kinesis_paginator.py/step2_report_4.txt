  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and overall security risk.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Type annotations and paginator class definitions for AWS Kinesis.\n- Content: Purely structural, involving class inheritance, method signatures, and type annotations.\n- Source: Imports, conditional typing, no external data or network operations.\n- Anomalies: None detected; no obfuscated code, secrets, or malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Benign, well-structured type stub code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.9 — *Potentially overestimated*. Since no malicious activity is detected, a risk score of 0.1 or 0 is more appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar to Report 1, type annotations and paginator classes.\n- Content: Uses complex typing logic, conditional imports, and ignore comments.\n- Anomalies: No malicious intent; complexity is typical for type hinting.\n- Conclusion: Legitimate, type-safe wrapper code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — *Appropriate*, but possibly slightly high given the benign nature. A risk of 0 is justified.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Content: Standard class definitions, no external data processing.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious code.\n- Conclusion: Legitimate, safe code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — *Appropriate*.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Type annotations and paginator classes.\n- Content: Clear, straightforward, no malicious behavior.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Conclusion: Benign.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — *Appropriate*.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Content: No external data, network, or malicious constructs.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Conclusion: Safe.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — *Appropriate*.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The risk scores assigned in Reports 1 and 2 are slightly higher than justified given the benign nature of the code. They should be lowered to 0 or 0.1.\n- Malware scores are correctly at 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n- Obfuscation scores are correctly at 0.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- For all reports, especially 1 and 2, reduce the security risk score to 0 or 0.1, as no real security concern exists.\n- The malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate at 0.\n- Overall, the code is a legitimate, well-structured type annotation module with no security risks.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (to account for the complexity and conditional typing, but primarily benign)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, non-malicious, and serves as a type annotation stub for boto3 Kinesis paginators.",
