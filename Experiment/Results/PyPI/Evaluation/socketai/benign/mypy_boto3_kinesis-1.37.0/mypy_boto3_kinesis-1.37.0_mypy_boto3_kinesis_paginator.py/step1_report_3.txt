{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator classes for the boto3 kinesis service client, providing type-safe access to pagination methods.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type definitions; class method parameters using Unpack with type definitions.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code primarily defines classes and type annotations without executing untrusted input or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the methods define type-safe interfaces without processing untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected. Use of conditional imports for type support is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up type annotations and paginators for boto3 Kinesis client, including conditional imports for type hints based on Python version. It defines classes that extend Paginator with properly annotated 'paginate' methods, utilizing Unpack for flexible argument passing. No external data, network, or file operations are present. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, type-safe implementation of paginator classes for boto3 Kinesis client, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
