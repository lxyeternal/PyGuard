  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report states that the code is solely for type annotations and class definitions for boto3 Kinesis paginators, with no malicious behavior or security risks.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score is 0, which aligns with the benign nature. Risk score is 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities.\n- **Potential Issue:** The report mentions \"no untrusted data sources or dangerous sinks,\" which is accurate. The code does not process external data or execute any unsafe operations.\n- **Verdict:** The report's reasoning is sound. No modifications needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the type safety and the absence of malicious intent. Notes the use of conditional typing and ignore comments as typical complexity.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score is 0, and security risk is 0.1, which is acceptable given the complexity but no actual risk.\n- **Potential Issue:** The mention of \"complex typing logic\" is not a security concern but could be flagged if overinterpreted. Still, it doesn't indicate malicious behavior.\n- **Verdict:** The reasoning is consistent. No change needed.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, a benign description of type annotations and class definitions for boto3 Kinesis paginators. No external data processing or malicious code.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score is 0; security risk is 0, aligning with the code's nature.\n- **Potential Issue:** None identified.\n- **Verdict:** Well justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the code's role in type safety and class structure without malicious intent.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score is 0; security risk is 0, appropriate for this code.\n- **Potential Issue:** None.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with prior assessments—benign, purely for type annotations and class hierarchies.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score is 0; security risk is 0, matching the code's function.\n- **Potential Issue:** None.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, which is appropriate; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** All are 0 or very close to 0, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\nGiven the detailed analysis, I agree with the reports' assessments. The code is a well-structured, type-annotated set of paginator classes for boto3 Kinesis, with no signs of malicious activity or security issues.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the code's purpose, structure, and the absence of any security concerns.",
