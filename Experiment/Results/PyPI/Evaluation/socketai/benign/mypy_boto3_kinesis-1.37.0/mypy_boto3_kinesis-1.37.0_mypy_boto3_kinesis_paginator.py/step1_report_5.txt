{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for the Kinesis service client in boto3, providing structured access to paginated API responses.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from imported modules, class method parameters, and type definitions. No external input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that could lead to data leaks, system modifications, or network communication. The code solely defines type annotations and class structures.",
  "flows": "The code establishes class hierarchies and method signatures for paginators, with no data flow involving untrusted sources. It primarily organizes type information.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code. The code appears straightforward, with clear class and method definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines paginator classes for the boto3 Kinesis client, with type annotations for inputs and outputs. It uses conditional imports based on Python version, imports necessary types, and structures paginator classes accordingly. No external input, network communication, or file operations are present. The code is purely for type checking and class inheritance, with no signs of malicious behavior or malicious code constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign implementation of type annotations and class hierarchies for boto3 paginators. There are no indicators of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. The code appears safe and intended for type checking and documentation purposes.",
