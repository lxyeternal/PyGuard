  "purpose": "Provide CLI information about the package and its version.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout for output.",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for displaying information.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument detection to output version or package info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no unusual code patterns, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports only sys, defines functions to output package info and version, and checks command-line arguments to determine output. The code is straightforward and appears to be a standard CLI utility. No user input is processed beyond argument checking, and outputs are static strings. No data leaks, malicious commands, or obfuscated code detected. No external network access or sensitive data handling is involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility for displaying package information and version. No malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious activity detected.",
