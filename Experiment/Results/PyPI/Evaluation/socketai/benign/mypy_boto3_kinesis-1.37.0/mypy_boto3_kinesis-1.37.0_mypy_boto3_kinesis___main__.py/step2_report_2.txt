  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code review:**\n   - The code is a simple CLI script that checks for the `--version` argument and prints either version info or package info.\n   - It uses only standard library modules (`sys`) and static strings.\n   - There are no external network calls, dynamic code execution, or handling of untrusted input beyond argument checking.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - The functions are straightforward, and the control flow is simple.\n\n2. **Report analysis:**\n   - All five reports consistently state that the code is benign, straightforward, and performs only informational output.\n   - They mention no anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n   - The reasoning in all reports aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n3. **Scores review:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1, which is justified.\n\n4. **Potential issues or discrepancies:**\n   - The reports are consistent and reasonable.\n   - No suspicious claims or assumptions are made.\n   - The code's behavior and the analysis align well.\n\n5. **Final assessment:**\n   - The code is a benign CLI utility.\n   - No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n   - The scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is safe, straightforward, and serves a simple informational purpose. No changes to the scores or assessments are necessary.",
