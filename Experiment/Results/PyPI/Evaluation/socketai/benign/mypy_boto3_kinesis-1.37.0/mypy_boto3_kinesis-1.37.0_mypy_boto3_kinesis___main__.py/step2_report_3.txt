  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review and Functionality Confirmation:**\n   - The code is a simple CLI script that responds to a `--version` argument by printing the version number, and otherwise prints package info.\n   - It uses only standard library functions (`sys.argv`, `sys.stdout.write()`), with no external dependencies or dynamic code execution.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets beyond static info, and no suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports uniformly agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious behavior.\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident in the reports—they correctly identify the code as a simple informational CLI utility.\n   - The assessments are consistent and thorough, with no contradictions or overlooked issues.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign `0`, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign `0`, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign `0`, which is justified given the lack of vulnerabilities or malicious patterns.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Assumptions:**\n   - Since the code only outputs static info and version details, there are no vulnerabilities or malicious activities to assume.\n   - The reports correctly avoid assumptions about future malicious intent or vulnerabilities based solely on static code analysis.\n\n5. **Consistency and Reasonableness of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code and the detailed analyses.\n   - The confidence levels are high (1), reflecting the straightforward and benign nature of the code.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - Based on the code and reports, the malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should all remain at 0.\n   - No additional risks or concerns are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The code is a simple, safe CLI utility with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The reports are accurate and consistent. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the evidence presented.",
