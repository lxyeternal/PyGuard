  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review & Issue Confirmation:**\n   - The code is a simple CLI script that outputs static package info or version based on command-line arguments.\n   - It reads `sys.argv` and writes to `sys.stdout`. There are no external network calls, no dynamic code execution, no handling of untrusted input beyond argument detection.\n   - The code contains no secrets, credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The logic is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the script is benign, straightforward, and safe.\n   - They correctly identify the absence of malicious patterns, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n   - No issues are found in the reasoning or summary; the assessments are consistent with the code.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - malware: 0\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments needed; the scores are reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports and the code show no malicious activity or vulnerabilities, a risk score above 0.5 is unwarranted.\n   - The code is purely informational with no security implications.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n   - No malicious behavior is present or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions; they rely on direct code analysis.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities or threats are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency & Final Assessment:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code and analysis.\n   - The confidence levels are high (1), which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Additional Remarks:\n- The code is a minimal, safe CLI utility.\n- No hidden backdoors, malicious code, or security concerns are evident.\n- The reports are accurate and appropriately conservative.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is entirely benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are justified and should remain at zero for malware and security risk, with obfuscation also at zero.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \n- Keep all scores at 0.  \n- No further action needed.",
