{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a CLI utility that outputs package information or version details based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to sys.stdout.",
  "flows": "sys.argv is checked for '--version'; if present, print_version() is called, otherwise print_info() is called, both writing static strings to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward with static strings and no dynamic or untrusted input handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal CLI script that responds to '--version' argument by printing version info, otherwise prints package info. It uses only standard library functions and static strings, with no external network calls, dynamic code execution, or handling of untrusted input beyond argument detection. No secrets, credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The logic is simple and direct, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving a simple informational purpose. There are no malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or security risks present. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately set to 0, and confidence is high. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
