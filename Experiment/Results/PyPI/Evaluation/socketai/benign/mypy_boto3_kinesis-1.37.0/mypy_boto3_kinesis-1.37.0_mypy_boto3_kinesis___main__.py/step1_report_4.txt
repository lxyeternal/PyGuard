  "purpose": "Provide CLI information about the package, including version and documentation details.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout for output",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write outputs data to stdout",
  "flows": "Command-line input (--version) triggers printing version; otherwise, info is printed to stdout",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles simple CLI commands to display package information and version. It reads command-line arguments via sys.argv and writes output via sys.stdout.write. There are no external data inputs, network calls, or suspicious operations. No obfuscated or malicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and performs no security-sensitive operations beyond output display.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard CLI entrypoint for informational output. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be safe and intended solely for user guidance.",
