  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**1. Confirm presence of issues in the code:**\n- The code is a straightforward CLI script that checks for a `--version` argument and outputs either version info or package details.\n- All reports agree that the code is simple, static, and uses standard library functions.\n- No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data leaks are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscation are detected.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears benign, with no issues or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning:**\n- The reports uniformly state that the code is straightforward and safe, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n- No errors or flawed reasoning are evident in the reports.\n- The reports correctly identify that the script does not perform any suspicious or malicious actions.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports' reasoning is sound and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**3. Review the scores assigned to each issue:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n  - `confidence`: 1 (or 1.0)\n- These scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's behavior.\n- Since no malicious activity or obfuscation is detected, these scores are appropriate.\n\n**4. Justify any risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n- None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5, which is correct.\n- The code is purely informational, with no security implications.\n\n**5. Address malware scores:**\n- All reports assign `malware`: 0, which is justified.\n- No malicious intent or behavior is evident.\n\n**6. Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities:**\n- The reports do not assume vulnerabilities beyond the scope of static info display.\n- They correctly avoid speculative claims about potential vulnerabilities.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores with the report:**\n- The scores are consistent and justified based on the code and analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Overall, the code is a benign CLI utility with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation.**  \n**Scores should remain at:**\n- `malware`: 0\n- `obfuscated`: 0\n- `securityRisk`: 0\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate, thorough, and consistent with the code's behavior. No modifications to the scores are necessary. The code is safe, straightforward, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores; no further action needed.",
