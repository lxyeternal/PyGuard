  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious behaviors detected. No obfuscated code, malicious patterns, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script simply checks for '--version' argument and prints version info or package details accordingly. It uses standard library functions and simple control flow. There are no external network calls, code injections, or data leaks. The code is straightforward and adheres to expected CLI patterns. No anomalies or suspicious behavior found.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign CLI script for displaying package info and version. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
