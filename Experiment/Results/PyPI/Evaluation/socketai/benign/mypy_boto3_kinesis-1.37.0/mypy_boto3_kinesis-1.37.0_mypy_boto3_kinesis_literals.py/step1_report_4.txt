  "purpose": "Define Python type literals for AWS Kinesis service and related AWS service identifiers, enabling type safety and validation in boto3 stubs.",
  "sources": "Type annotations for literal definitions, including hardcoded string literals for AWS resource types and service names.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or execute runtime logic that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code solely consists of static type definitions and conditional imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code uses standard pattern for conditional import based on Python version. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of string literal types representing various AWS resource identifiers, service names, and region codes. It includes a version check for importing 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions', which is a common pattern for compatibility. No runtime data processing, external input, or security-sensitive operations are present. The literals serve solely for static type checking. There is no evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or potential supply chain attacks. The code appears to be a well-structured, static definition module for type safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static type definition file for AWS boto3 stubs, containing no malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and intended for type annotations.",
