  "purpose": "Define type annotations for AWS Kinesis service literal definitions and related AWS service identifiers to facilitate type checking and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Import statements for sys and typing; assignment of string literals for various AWS service and resource types.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only defines constants and type aliases without processing untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; there are no data flows from source to sink involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; the code strictly defines static type literals for AWS SDK integration.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version. It then declares a series of type aliases using 'Literal' with fixed string values representing AWS service names, resource types, pagination, and waiter identifiers. There is no dynamic code, input handling, or data manipulation present. All definitions are static and intended for type checking purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of type alias definitions for AWS SDK literals, with no malicious intent or security risks. It contains no dynamic execution, external data handling, or suspicious constructs. The code is benign and solely for type annotation support.",
