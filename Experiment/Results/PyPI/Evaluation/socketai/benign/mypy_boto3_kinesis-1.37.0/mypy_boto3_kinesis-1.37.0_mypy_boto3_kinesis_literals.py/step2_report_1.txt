  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code consists solely of static type alias definitions for AWS service identifiers, statuses, regions, etc.\n- No dynamic code, data processing, or input handling is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors.\n- The only notable inconsistency is the copyright year set to 2025, which appears fictitious or outdated but is not malicious.\n- The conditional import of `Literal` based on Python version is standard practice for compatibility.\n- The literals are used purely for type safety and static analysis support.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** All reports correctly identify that the code is static, with no runtime or dynamic elements.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No malicious activity is present; all evidence points to benign static type definitions.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation is present; code is straightforward.\n- **Security risks:** None detected. The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or handle secrets.\n\n### Potential points of concern:\n- The copyright year 2025 is inconsistent with the current date, but this is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n- No other anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.\n\n### Scores and reasoning:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports. This is appropriate given the static, benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0. All code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or very low values, which is justified.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All reports are consistent in their assessment, correctly concluding the code is safe and intended solely for type annotations.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment and recommendations:\n\n**Overall malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected or suggested.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear, static, and well-structured.\n\n**Risk score:** **0** — no security risk or vulnerabilities present.\n\n**Additional note:** The only minor anomaly is the copyright year, which does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThis code is a benign, static set of type alias definitions for AWS SDK literals, serving to improve type safety and code clarity. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The reported scores are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: **malware = 0**, **obfuscated = 0**, **risk = 0**. The code is safe and purely for static type annotation purposes.",
