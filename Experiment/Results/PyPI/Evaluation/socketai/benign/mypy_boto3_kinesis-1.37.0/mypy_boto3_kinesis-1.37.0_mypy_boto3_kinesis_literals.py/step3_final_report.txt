{
  "purpose": "Static type alias definitions for AWS service identifiers, statuses, regions, and related literals to support type safety and static analysis in Python code.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string literals assigned to type aliases, imported modules for version compatibility.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input, output, or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "None; static definitions without data flow or runtime logic.",
  "anomalies": "The copyright year is set to 2025, which is inconsistent with current dates but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type alias definitions using Literal for AWS service names, statuses, regions, and other constants. There are no dynamic code, data processing, network operations, or secrets. The conditional import for 'Literal' is standard for compatibility. The only unusual aspect is the copyright year 2025, which appears to be a placeholder or typo. Overall, the code is straightforward, static, and intended solely for type safety, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and serves to improve type safety for AWS SDK usage. No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The only minor anomaly is the copyright year, which does not impact security.",
