  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines type literals for AWS Kinesis and related services, with static definitions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data handling or dynamic execution.\n- **Anomalies:** Mentions a copyright date of 2025, which is inconsistent but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Purely static type alias definitions for type safety; no runtime or malicious activity.\n- **Security implications:** No malware, obfuscation, or security risks detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, defining constants for AWS Kinesis.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** Same as above, with the 2025 copyright date.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Static definitions for type checking; no malicious behavior.\n- **Security implications:** No malware, no obfuscation, no security threat.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines literals for AWS resource identifiers, with conditional import for 'Literal'.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior; standard pattern.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Static type alias definitions for AWS SDK; safe.\n- **Security implications:** No malware, malicious code, or obfuscation.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar static type definitions with version check for 'Literal'.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No runtime data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No issues detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Static, safe type annotations.\n- **Security implications:** No malware or malicious intent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines string literal types for AWS literals, with sys import for version check.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious elements.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Static type aliases, safe for use.\n- **Security implications:** No malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Code nature:** All reports describe static, type alias definitions for AWS service identifiers and statuses.\n- **Malware potential:** None detected across all reports. The code does not execute any runtime logic, process untrusted data, or perform network operations.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed. The code is straightforward and well-structured.\n- **Security risk:** Zero. The code serves purely as type annotations for static analysis and IDE support.\n- **Anomalies:** The only minor oddity is the copyright year 2025, which seems inconsistent but not malicious.\n\n### Final recommendation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, static definitions)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk or vulnerabilities)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is a benign, static set of type alias definitions for AWS SDK usage, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. It enhances type safety and code clarity but poses no security threat.\n\nIf I were to assign scores based on this analysis:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nAll reports are consistent with this assessment.",
