  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines type literals for AWS Kinesis and other AWS services, sourced from static string literals.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No dynamic code, no input, no data flow; only static definitions. The only oddity is the copyright year 2025, which is inconsistent but not malicious.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Benign static type alias definitions. No malware, no security risk. Confidence: 1.0.\n\n**Assessment:** Fully accurate. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above—type literals for AWS Kinesis constants, sourced from static strings.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No data processing or external input. The only notable point is the copyright date set to 2025, which seems inconsistent.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, static definitions with no malicious intent. Confidence: 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No malware or security issues. The date anomaly is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines type annotations for AWS service literals, with import statements for sys and typing.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No dynamic code, data processing, or external input. Uses standard pattern for conditional import.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Static, benign type alias definitions. No malicious behavior. Confidence: 1.0.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type literals for AWS resource identifiers, with version check for 'Literal'.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No runtime logic or data handling. The literals are static strings for type safety.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, static type definitions. No malware or malicious intent. Confidence: 1.0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** String literal types for AWS service literals, with 'sys' import for version check.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No data flow, no dynamic code, no secrets. All static literals.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Benign static type alias definitions. No malicious behavior. Confidence: 1.0.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Presence of issues in code:** **None**. All reports correctly identify that the code is purely static type alias definitions for AWS service identifiers.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports agree there are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- **Security risk:** Zero in all cases; no dynamic execution, no external data, no secrets.\n- **Anomalies:** The only minor anomaly is the copyright year 2025, which is inconsistent but not malicious.\n\n### **Final Justification & Scores:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports, correct.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, correct.\n- **Risk score:** Given the static, benign nature, the risk score should be **0**.\n\n---\n\n### **My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a straightforward static type alias module, with no runtime or dynamic features, no external data, and no malicious behaviors. The only oddity is the fictitious copyright year, which does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate. The code is safe, static, and intended solely for type safety. No changes needed.",
