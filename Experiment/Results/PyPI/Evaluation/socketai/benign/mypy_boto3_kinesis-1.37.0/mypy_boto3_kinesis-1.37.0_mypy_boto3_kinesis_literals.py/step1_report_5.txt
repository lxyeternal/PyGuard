  "purpose": "Define string literal types for AWS Kinesis service literals and other AWS service identifiers for type annotations.",
  "sources": "Imports 'sys' to check Python version; defines string literal types and assigns them to variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; all data appears to be static string definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; all variables are statically assigned string literals.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior. The code is primarily type annotations and static definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'sys' to conditionally import 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version, which is standard practice. It then defines multiple type aliases using 'Literal', which are used for type hinting AWS service constants. All the values are static strings representing AWS resource types, regions, service names, etc., with no dynamic or external input handling. There are no obfuscated elements, code injections, or malicious behaviors. The structure is straightforward and solely for type annotations, consistent with safe and intended use.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of type aliases for AWS service string literals intended for type annotations. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no secrets, no external data handling, and no obfuscated or harmful code. It is safe and purely for static type safety enhancements.",
