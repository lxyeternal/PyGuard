{
  "purpose": "Define type literals for various AWS Kinesis and other AWS service string identifiers for type safety and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Static definitions of string literals assigned to variables; no input or data reading operations present.",
  "sinks": "No sink points where untrusted data could cause leaks or malicious effects; all data is statically defined.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; only static literals are used.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward type annotation definitions with conditional imports based on Python version.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up type aliases for string literals used to represent specific AWS service identifiers and status strings. It includes a conditional import for 'Literal' to maintain compatibility with older Python versions. No runtime input, data processing, or dynamic execution occurs. All strings are hardcoded literals, serving purely for type safety in static analysis and IDE support. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic features are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, static set of type alias definitions intended for improved type safety and code readability within AWS SDK usage. It poses no security threat, does not contain malware, and has no signs of malicious intent.",
