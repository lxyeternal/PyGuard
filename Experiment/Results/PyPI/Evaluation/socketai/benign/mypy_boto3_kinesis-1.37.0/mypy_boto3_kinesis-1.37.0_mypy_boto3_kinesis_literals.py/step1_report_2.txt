{
  "purpose": "Define type literals for various AWS Kinesis service constants to improve type safety and code clarity in type annotations.",
  "sources": "The code sources are the literal string definitions assigned to various type aliases.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing are present; the code only defines constants.",
  "flows": "No data flow from input to output, as this code only establishes type annotations and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code strictly defines static literals for type annotations. The only notable aspect is the copyright date set to 2025, which appears inconsistent but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type aliases for AWS Kinesis related literals, conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version, and declares multiple constants with fixed string values. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or input/output operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or malicious data handling. The only potential concern is the anomalous copyright year, which might suggest outdated or fictitious information but does not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of type alias definitions intended for type checking support. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It simply provides constants for better type safety when working with AWS Kinesis and other AWS services.",
