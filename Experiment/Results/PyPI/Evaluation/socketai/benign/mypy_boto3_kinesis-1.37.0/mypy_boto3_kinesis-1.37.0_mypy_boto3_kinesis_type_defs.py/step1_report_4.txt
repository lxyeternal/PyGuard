  "purpose": "Type definitions for AWS Kinesis service interactions, facilitating type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "Code reads metadata and constants from imported modules, and defines data structures for API requests and responses.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data; the code only defines types and imports without executing external commands or handling user input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code purely declares type annotations and data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. No obfuscated code, code injection, or malicious payloads. Usage of standard type annotations and data structures for SDK purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of type definitions for AWS Kinesis SDK in Python, including input/output structures and exception types. It imports standard and third-party modules for type annotations, adapts to Python versions, and defines data classes with no runtime logic or external calls. No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors are detected. The code is purely declarative, aimed at static typing and documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of type definitions for AWS SDK usage. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe to use as part of a Python SDK or type-checking setup.",
