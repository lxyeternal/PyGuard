  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to identify any inconsistencies, errors, or suspicious elements, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is purely type definitions for AWS Kinesis, with no runtime logic or external data handling.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. It’s a standard static type annotation module.\n- **Malware & Risk:** Malware score is 0; security risk is 0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully benign, well-structured, and purpose-built for static typing. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is only static type definitions, importing standard modules and 'botocore' for AWS types.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation. Uses conditional imports based on Python version, which is standard.\n- **Malware & Risk:** Malware score is 0; security risk is 0.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious intent or malicious code detected; purely a static type definitions module.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, type definitions for AWS Kinesis SDK, used for type checking and documentation.\n- **Findings:** No runtime logic, no external data processing, no suspicious code. Imports are standard.\n- **Malware & Risk:** Malware score is 0; security risk is 0.\n- **Assessment:** Benign, standard, and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above—type annotations and data structures for AWS Kinesis.\n- **Findings:** No evidence of malicious activity, no obfuscated code, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware & Risk:** Malware score is 0; security risk is 0.\n- **Assessment:** Clearly benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as previous—type annotations for AWS Kinesis SDK.\n- **Findings:** No untrusted data handling, no external input processing, no suspicious code.\n- **Malware & Risk:** Malware score is 0; security risk is 0.\n- **Assessment:** Safe, purely static definitions.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports confirm that the code consists solely of static type definitions, data structures, and imports for AWS SDK type annotations.\n- **Behavior & Anomalies:** No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or runtime logic.\n- **Import Sources:** Uses standard modules and 'botocore' types, which are legitimate.\n- **Purpose:** Clearly for static type checking, documentation, and SDK development.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious code, payloads, or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is transparent, straightforward, and well-structured.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks or vulnerabilities are present in static type definitions.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe entire set of reports correctly identifies this code as benign. It is a standard, well-structured static type annotation module for AWS Kinesis SDK in Python, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n\n**My estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis assessment aligns with all provided reports and the detailed analysis.",
