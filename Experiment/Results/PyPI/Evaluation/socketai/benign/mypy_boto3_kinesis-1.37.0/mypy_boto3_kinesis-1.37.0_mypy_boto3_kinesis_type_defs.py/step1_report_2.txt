{
  "purpose": "Type definitions and data structures for AWS Kinesis service interactions in Python, used for type hinting and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Import statements, type annotations, and class/variable definitions throughout the code; notably, the import of 'botocore' modules and literal type definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed; primarily type definitions and static annotations.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows or untrusted data processing present; static code with no dynamic execution or data handling logic.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior. Usage of sys.version_info for conditional imports is standard. No obfuscated code, no suspicious network or file operations. The code strictly defines types for AWS SDK interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code is solely a collection of type definitions, class structures, and imports for AWS Kinesis SDK typings. It imports standard and 'botocore' modules, and conditionally imports based on Python version. No runtime logic, data processing, or untrusted input handling is present. There are no signs of malicious activity, data leaks, or backdoors. The presence of standard AWS types and documentation comments indicates legitimate purpose. Overall, it is a static, well-structured type definition module without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static collection of type definitions for AWS Kinesis SDK, with no evidence of malware or malicious behavior. It serves as a type hinting aid and does not perform any runtime operations or data handling that could be malicious.",
