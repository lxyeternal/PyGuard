{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for AWS Kinesis service interactions, intended for type checking and clarity in Python code.",
  "sources": "Constant import statements, class definitions, and variable annotations that define data types, mostly static, with no external input reading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that handle untrusted data; the code primarily defines data types and constants.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; no executable logic or data processing present, only type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code strictly defines types and constants, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code solely provides type annotations, data class definitions, and constants for the AWS Kinesis SDK. There are no functions executing logic, no input/output handling, no network or file operations, and no dynamic code execution. It imports standard libraries and AWS SDK components, and defines static TypedDict classes, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is purely for type annotations and data structure definitions used in AWS SDK interactions. It contains no executable code, no data handling from external sources, and no malicious behavior. It is safe and intended for use as part of a larger codebase for type safety and clarity.",
