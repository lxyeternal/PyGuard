  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: code content, potential issues, and the validity of the malware and security risk scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is purely type definitions for AWS Kinesis, with no runtime logic or external data handling.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is static, well-structured, and free of malicious activity. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or backdoors are present.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0. These are appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code only contains type annotations, imports, and data structures for AWS SDK typings.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The use of sys.version_info for conditional imports is standard practice.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0. These are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is a set of static type definitions for AWS Kinesis, with no runtime logic.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious or suspicious patterns. The code's purpose is clear: static type checking and documentation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0. Correct.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Type definitions for AWS Kinesis, with no external data handling or dynamic code.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity. The code is purely declarative.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as others—type annotations and data structures for AWS SDK, no executable logic.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0. Correct.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is solely type definitions for AWS Kinesis SDK in Python.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All are appropriately set to 0, as there's no evidence of malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Security Risk:** Also correctly scored at 0, given the static, benign nature.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks, no runtime logic, no external data handling.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent, accurate, and the scores reflect the benign nature of the code. No further action or concern is warranted.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always maintain vigilance with code that interfaces with external SDKs or dependencies, but in this case, the static type definitions pose no security threat.",
