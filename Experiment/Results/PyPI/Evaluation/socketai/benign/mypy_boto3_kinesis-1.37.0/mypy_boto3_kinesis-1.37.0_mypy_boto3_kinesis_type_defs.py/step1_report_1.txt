{
  "purpose": "Type definitions for AWS Kinesis service, used for static type checking and code clarity.",
  "sources": "All type annotation classes and constants that define data structures, and imported modules such as sys, datetime, typing, and botocore.",
  "sinks": "No execution sinks present; code solely defines data types for type checking and documentation purposes.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; the code is purely static type annotations with no data processing or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs. No functions, data processing, or network operations; only type definitions and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of Python TypedDict classes and constants for AWS Kinesis SDK type annotations. It imports necessary modules securely, defines types for API inputs/outputs, and includes no executable logic, network operations, or data manipulations. The code adheres to standard type annotation patterns without obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign, well-structured set of type definitions for AWS Kinesis client SDK. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious code. The code solely serves to facilitate static type checking.",
