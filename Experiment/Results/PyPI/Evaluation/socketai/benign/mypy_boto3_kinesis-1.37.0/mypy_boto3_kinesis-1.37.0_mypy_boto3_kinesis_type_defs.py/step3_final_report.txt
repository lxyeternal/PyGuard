  "purpose": "Type annotations for AWS Kinesis service type definitions, used for static type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "All type annotation classes, constants, and imports within the module.",
  "sinks": "None; purely static definitions with no runtime data handling.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; static type annotations only.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of TypedDict classes, constants, and conditional imports for Python version compatibility. It imports modules securely and defines data structures for AWS Kinesis SDK. There is no executable logic, network activity, or external data processing. The purpose is solely for static type checking and documentation, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of static type definitions for AWS Kinesis SDK in Python. It poses no security risk, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation.",
