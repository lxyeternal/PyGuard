  "purpose": "A cross-platform implementation of the 'which' command to locate executables in the system PATH, copied from an external source for compatibility.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables ('PATH', 'PATHEXT'), input command ('cmd'), and system info ('sys.platform'); filesystem checks with os.path.exists and os.access.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is used in a way that leads to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Input command and environment variables influence filesystem checks; no data flows leading to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, copied from reputable sources, with standard platform-specific handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-documented implementation of 'which', performing environment variable reads, filesystem existence, and permission checks. It includes platform-specific logic for Windows and Unix-like systems. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present. The code's purpose is benign, and it does not perform any network activity or data exfiltration. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with the code's behavior and intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility function with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risk. The scores are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
