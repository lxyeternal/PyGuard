  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The report confirms the code is a benign, standard implementation of 'which', copied from a reputable source, with no malicious activity.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None identified.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. These seem appropriate given the analysis.\n- **Justification for scores:** The code is straightforward, with no suspicious behavior, so the zero scores are justified.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Similar to report 1, it confirms the code is a compatibility utility with no malicious intent.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or obfuscation is present.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Again, it describes a standard, well-understood implementation.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1. The slight securityRisk score reflects the potential for misuse if user input is not sanitized, but since the function only locates files, not executes them, this is minimal.\n- **Justification:** The risk is low; the code could be used maliciously if combined with other code, but as is, it's benign.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues present?** No. It notes the code is a straightforward utility copied from an open-source project.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1. Similar reasoning as report 3 applies.\n- **Justification:** Slightly elevated securityRisk score is reasonable due to potential misuse, but overall, the code remains benign.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues present?** No. It confirms the code is a standard, compatible implementation with no malicious activity.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. The high confidence score supports the benign assessment.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious behavior or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low (0.1) in some reports, justified by the potential for misuse, but overall minimal.\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the code's nature—standard, well-documented, copied from reputable sources, with no malicious or obfuscated elements—the scores are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to account for potential misuse if integrated maliciously, but inherently benign)\n\nThis is a benign utility function with no security concerns based on the provided reports.",
