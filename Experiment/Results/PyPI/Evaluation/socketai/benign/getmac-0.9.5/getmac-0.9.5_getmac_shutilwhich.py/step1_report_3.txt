{
  "purpose": "This code implements a 'which' function to locate executables in the system's PATH, supporting both Unix-like and Windows platforms.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (PATH, PATHEXT), and input command name (cmd).",
  "sinks": "Uses os.path and os.access to verify file existence and executability; no direct data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Input command name -> path resolution -> file existence and access checks -> return executable path or None.",
  "anomalies": "None observed; code appears to be a standard implementation copied from Python sources. No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of the 'which' command, with platform-specific handling for Windows and Unix-like systems. It uses environment variables to determine search paths, performs checks for file existence and executability, and handles special cases for Windows extensions. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present. The code's purpose is clearly to locate executables, which is common in system utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of the 'which' utility, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It relies on environment variables and filesystem checks without any suspicious activities.",
