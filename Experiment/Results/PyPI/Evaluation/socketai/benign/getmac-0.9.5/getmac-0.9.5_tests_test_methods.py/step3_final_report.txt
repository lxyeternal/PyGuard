{
  "purpose": "A comprehensive test suite for the getmac package, validating MAC address retrieval across various operating systems through mocked command outputs and sample data.",
  "sources": "Mocked command outputs, sample files, and system call simulations.",
  "sinks": "No data exfiltration, no execution of untrusted commands, no network activity, and no modification of system state.",
  "flows": "Parsing mocked command outputs and files to verify MAC address extraction functions without external effects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; standard testing patterns with extensive mocking.",
  "analysis": "The code is a controlled testing environment designed to validate parsing logic for network interfaces and MAC addresses across multiple OSes. It relies on sample data and mocks subprocess calls and file reads, with no actual system modifications, network communications, or malicious payloads. No obfuscation or backdoors are present. The purpose is validation, not malicious activity. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting the benign nature of test code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured test suite with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. It poses no supply chain threat and is appropriate for use in validation environments.",
