  "purpose": "Expose the get_mac_address function and __version__ from the getmac module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing __version__ and get_mac_address from a local getmac module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output functions are present; no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code simply re-exports functions and variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports specific elements from a local module named getmac and defines __all__ for exports. It does not process input, execute dynamic code, or contain any suspicious logic. It appears to be a standard module re-export pattern with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward re-export of functions and variables from a local module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is safe based on this snippet.",
