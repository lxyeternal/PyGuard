{
  "purpose": "This module re-exports the get_mac_address function from the getmac submodule and declares __version__ for versioning purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local getmac module, accessing __version__ and get_mac_address.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "The code imports functions and variables from a local module, then makes get_mac_address available publicly; no data flows are evident beyond import/export.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module re-export pattern, importing __version__ and get_mac_address from a local submodule called getmac, then exposing only get_mac_address. There are no input sources like user input, environment variables, or network data. There are no sink functions or external calls that could be malicious. The code structure is clean, and no suspicious behavior or obfuscation is present. Its purpose appears to be to provide an accessible API for retrieving the MAC address.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It simply manages module exports for a MAC address utility. No security concerns or malware signals are present.",
