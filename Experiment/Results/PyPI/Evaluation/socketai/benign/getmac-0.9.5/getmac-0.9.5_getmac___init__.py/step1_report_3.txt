  "purpose": "Exports the get_mac_address function and version information from the getmac module.",
  "sources": "Imports __version__ and get_mac_address from a relative module getmac.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data output or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows; only imports and exports without data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward module re-export.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific elements from a local module, exposing get_mac_address for external use. It also exposes __version__ but does not utilize it internally. The code is minimal and lacks any suspicious behavior such as data leaks, network activity, or obfuscated code. The use of relative import suggests it's part of a package structure, and nothing suspicious is visible in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple module export statement with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It only re-exports functions and version info, serving as a public interface.",
