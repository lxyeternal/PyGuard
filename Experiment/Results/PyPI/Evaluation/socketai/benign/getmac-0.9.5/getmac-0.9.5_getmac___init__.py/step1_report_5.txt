  "purpose": "The code re-exports the 'get_mac_address' function and '__version__' from a local module 'getmac', making 'get_mac_address' available for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports '__version__' and 'get_mac_address' from the local module 'getmac'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data leaks present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Imports from 'getmac' → Exports 'get_mac_address'. No data flows involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports specific attributes from a local module 'getmac' and exposes 'get_mac_address' via '__all__'. It also imports '__version__' but does not use or expose it. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code obfuscation, or security risks. No external data handling, network operations, or other potentially malicious actions are present in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic, benign re-export of functions and version info from a local module. No malicious or security concerns are evident.",
