  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n```python\nfrom .getmac import __version__, get_mac_address\n\n__all__ = [\"get_mac_address\"]\n```\n\nThis code is a minimal re-export module, importing `__version__` and `get_mac_address` from a local `getmac` module, then exposing only `get_mac_address` via `__all__`. The `__version__` is imported but not used or exposed.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  No. The code does not contain any malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. It is a straightforward module re-export pattern.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- **Any errors or flaws?**  \n  No. The code is minimal, clear, and correct for its purpose.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.  \n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0, which is justified.\n\n### Potential risks:\n- The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code.  \n- The import of `__version__` is unused, but that does not pose a security risk.  \n- The purpose is purely to re-export functions and variables.\n\n### Claims based on assumptions:\n- No claims about vulnerabilities are made; all reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Additional comments:\n- The code is safe, standard for module re-exports.\n- The `__version__` import could be removed if unused, but this does not affect security.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Estimate |\n|-----------------|----------------|\n| Malware         | 0              |\n| Obfuscated      | 0              |\n| Security Risk   | 0              |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code snippet is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The reports are accurate in their assessments.",
