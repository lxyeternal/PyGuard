{
  "purpose": "Re-exporting specific functions and version info from the 'getmac' module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .getmac module",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, output, or external communication present",
  "flows": "No data flow paths from untrusted sources to sinks; code only performs import and export of symbols",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward re-export with no additional logic, no hardcoded secrets or malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports version info and a function from a local module and exposes the get_mac_address function publicly. It does not perform any data handling, network operations, or potentially malicious activities. The structure is minimal and typical for a Python package's __init__.py or module re-exporting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and solely serves as an interface to the getmac module functions. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
