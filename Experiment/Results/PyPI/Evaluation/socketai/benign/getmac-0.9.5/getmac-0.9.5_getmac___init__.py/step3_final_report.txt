{
  "purpose": "This code re-exports the get_mac_address function from a local module, serving as an interface for external modules to access MAC address retrieval functionality.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .getmac importing __version__ and get_mac_address",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any output operations",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports and exposes functions",
  "anomalies": "The import of __version__ is unused, which is unnecessary but not suspicious or malicious",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal module re-export pattern, importing __version__ and get_mac_address from a local module, then exposing only get_mac_address via __all__. No input/output handling, network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation is present. The code is straightforward and typical for a package's __init__.py. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with full confidence. The import of __version__ is unused but does not impact security. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign re-export module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's straightforward nature.",
