  "purpose": "Command-line utility to retrieve MAC addresses of local or remote network interfaces and hosts",
  "sources": "User inputs via command-line arguments (interface, IP addresses, hostname, platform override, method override, verbosity/debug flags)",
  "sinks": "Printing the retrieved MAC address to standard output, setting logging levels, modifying module variables (PORT, OVERRIDE_PLATFORM, FORCE_METHOD)",
  "flows": "User inputs -> Argument parser -> Conditional configuration (logging, getmac module variables) -> getmac.get_mac_address() call -> Output (print) or exit code",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no malicious code, no suspicious network activity or backdoors. Usage of getmac module variables based on user input is normal, assuming getmac is a legitimate, trusted package.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily functions as a command-line interface to the getmac package, configuring parameters based on user input. It performs input validation and sets configuration options for getmac. There are no evident signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The logging configuration is standard, and no network requests or suspicious activities are directly embedded in this code. It relies on the getmac package for core functionality. The code appears to be a typical CLI wrapper around a legitimate library, with no suspicious operations detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI tool for retrieving MAC addresses, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It securely handles user inputs, configures the underlying library, and outputs results appropriately. No malware or malicious behavior is detected.",
