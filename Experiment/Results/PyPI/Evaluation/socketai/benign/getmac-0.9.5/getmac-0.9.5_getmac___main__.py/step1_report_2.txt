{
  "purpose": "Command-line utility to retrieve MAC addresses of local or remote network interfaces or hosts.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments (`argparse`) for user input; imported `getmac` module for retrieving MAC addresses.",
  "flows": "User input from command-line arguments → configuration of parameters and options → call to `getmac.get_mac_address()` with user-specified parameters → output of MAC address if found.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. The code mainly processes user input and delegates to `getmac`. No unusual dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward CLI wrapper around the `getmac` module, parsing various user options to specify network parameters. It configures global variables in the `getmac` module based on user input, then calls `getmac.get_mac_address()`. The logic for data flow is clear, with no suspicious or malicious operations. There are no signs of data exfiltration, network scanning beyond intended functionality, or malicious code injections. The code includes standard logging and argument parsing without any hidden or suspicious behavior. It does not perform any malicious actions such as connecting to unknown domains, sending data over the network without user consent, or executing code from untrusted sources.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard command-line interface for a network utility, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It relies on the `getmac` module for core functionality, which is not included here but appears to be a standard package. The script does not contain malware or suspicious behavior. Overall, the code appears safe and benign.",
