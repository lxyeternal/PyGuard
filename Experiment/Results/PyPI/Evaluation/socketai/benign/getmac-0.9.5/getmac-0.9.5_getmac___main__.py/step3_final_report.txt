{
  "purpose": "A CLI utility to retrieve MAC addresses of local or remote network interfaces, delegating core functionality to the getmac module.",
  "sources": "User input parameters such as interface name, IP addresses, hostname, platform override, and method override.",
  "sinks": "The getmac.get_mac_address() function, which may perform network requests or system calls based on user input.",
  "flows": "User inputs flow into argument parsing, which configures parameters passed to getmac.get_mac_address(), potentially leading to network or system operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical CLI wrapper that handles argument parsing, configuration, and calls an external getmac module for core functionality. No malicious code, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident. The main concern is the behavior of getmac.get_mac_address(), which could perform network requests based on user input, but this is expected for such utilities. The code itself is benign, with scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk (~0.2) due to reliance on external behavior. No signs of malicious intent or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign CLI utility for MAC address retrieval. No malicious or suspicious activity is detectable from this snippet. The overall security posture is safe, with minimal inherent risk primarily depending on the behavior of the getmac library, which appears legitimate.",
