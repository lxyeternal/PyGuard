{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up testing utilities for a project, including a fixture to load sample files and configuring debug levels for the 'getmac' library.",
  "sources": "The code reads sample files from a 'samples' directory using the get_sample fixture, and accesses the getmac module's DEBUG attribute.",
  "sinks": "The code writes to the getmac.DEBUG attribute, which influences debugging behavior, but no untrusted data is written or sent externally.",
  "flows": "Sample file content is read from disk and stored in variables, but not processed further or sent anywhere. Debug level is set internally.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or signs of malicious intent. No dynamic code execution, network communication, or credential handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard and third-party modules, including pytest for testing and getmac for MAC address retrieval. It defines a fixture that loads sample data from a local 'samples' directory, which is common in test setups. The getmac.DEBUG level is set to 4, which is an internal debugging setting. The code is structured as a typical test setup script with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. No external data sources are exploited, and no secret information is hardcoded.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign test setup script used for loading sample data and configuring debug levels for testing. It contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The code is standard and safe.",
