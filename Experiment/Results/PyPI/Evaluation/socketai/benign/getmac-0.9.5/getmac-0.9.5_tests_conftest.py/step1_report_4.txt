{
  "purpose": "This code sets up a test environment for the 'getmac' library, including a fixture to load sample data files for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads sample files from a 'samples' directory relative to the current file location.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks; the code does not process untrusted input beyond reading sample files for testing.",
  "flows": "The code reads sample files into memory for testing but does not process untrusted data dynamically at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is standard test setup code with no obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and third-party modules for testing (pytest) and system path operations. It sets a debug level on 'getmac', likely for verbose logging. A pytest fixture loads sample data files from a 'samples' directory, which is a common testing practice. There are no external data inputs, no network operations, and no credential handling. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical test setup for the 'getmac' library, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely to facilitate testing with sample data files.",
