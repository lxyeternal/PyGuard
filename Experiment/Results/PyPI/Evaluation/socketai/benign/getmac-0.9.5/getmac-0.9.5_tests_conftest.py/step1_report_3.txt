{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a test environment for the 'getmac' library, configuring debug levels and defining a fixture to load sample data files for testing.",
  "sources": "The code reads sample files from a 'samples' directory relative to the script location.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; no untrusted data is processed or outputted to external systems.",
  "flows": "The data flows from reading sample files via the fixture to test functions, which are not shown here.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward test setup code without suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and 'pytest' for testing. It configures debugging for 'getmac' and defines a fixture that loads sample data from files. The code appears to be for testing purposes only, with no malicious behavior or security issues. No data is being sent over the network, stored insecurely, or manipulated maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test setup with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply prepares sample data for testing the 'getmac' library.",
