{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a testing environment using pytest for the getmac library, including a fixture to load sample data files for testing.",
  "sources": "The code reads sample files from the filesystem located in a 'samples' directory relative to the current file.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is written or transmitted; no sinks are present that could lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The data flow involves reading sample files from disk during test setup, with no external or untrusted data sources or sinks involved.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward and typical for test setups.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and third-party modules like pytest and getmac. It sets a debug level for getmac, which is benign. The fixture loads sample data files from a 'samples' directory. There are no indications of malicious or suspicious operations. The code is consistent with standard testing practices.",
  "conclusion": "There is no malicious behavior or security risks detected. The code is a typical test setup for the getmac library, used for loading sample data during tests.",
