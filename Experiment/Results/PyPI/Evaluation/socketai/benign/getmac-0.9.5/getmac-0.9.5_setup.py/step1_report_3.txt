{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for packaging and distributing the 'getmac' Python library, including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md and CHANGELOG.md files for long_description; importing __version__ from getmac.getmac; accessing sys.version_info for Python version.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; the code primarily reads local files and sets package metadata.",
  "flows": "File reads for documentation, importing version info, setting up package configuration. No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration for packaging a Python module. It reads local documentation files, imports version info from a local module, and defines package metadata and entry points. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data manipulation involving untrusted sources is present. All operations are typical for a setup script, and there are no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no security risks detected. It solely manages package metadata and configuration.",
