  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'getmac' Python package, primarily used to distribute the package and its metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading files 'README.md' and 'CHANGELOG.md' to construct long_description; importing version info from 'getmac.getmac'.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks related to untrusted data processing or external communication; no network or data leak operations present.",
  "flows": "File reading flows into 'long_description'; package setup parameters configured from imported version and static strings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious data handling; straightforward package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup operations for a Python package, including reading documentation files, defining package metadata, and configuring entry points. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. No network activity, data exfiltration, or code obfuscation present. It adheres to typical packaging practices, and the imported modules are standard and do not contain malicious code. Overall, this is a benign setup script with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a normal Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It only handles package metadata and configuration.",
