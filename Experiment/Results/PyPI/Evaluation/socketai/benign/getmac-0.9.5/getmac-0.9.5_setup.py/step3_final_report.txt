{
  "purpose": "The code is a standard setup.py script used for packaging the 'getmac' Python module, primarily reading static documentation files and configuring package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md and CHANGELOG.md files; imports version info from getmac.getmac; static data used for package configuration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data outputs, network activity, or external data processing; only static file reads and package setup functions.",
  "flows": "Reads static files -> passes metadata to setuptools.setup() -> completes package configuration without external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or unusual behavior detected; straightforward package setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script performs static file reading for documentation, imports version info, and calls setuptools.setup() with metadata. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. The code structure is standard for Python packaging, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. All operations are static and intended for package distribution. No anomalies or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the scores are appropriate.",
