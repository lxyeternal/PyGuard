{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for a Python package named 'getmac', intended to package and distribute code that retrieves MAC addresses.",
  "sources": "Reads from README.md and CHANGELOG.md files for long description; imports version info from getmac.getmac; uses sys for version checks.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no external data output or network operations are performed.",
  "flows": "Reads static files to build long description, then passes data to setuptools.setup without further processing or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code, no suspicious imports or behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs package setup using setuptools, reads documentation files for long description, and configures package metadata and entry points. It imports version info from a local module. There are no data inputs from external sources besides files, no processing of untrusted input, and no network or system commands executed. The logic is straightforward and typical for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears safe and intended solely for package configuration.",
