{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for packaging and distributing the 'getmac' Python library, primarily to define metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md and CHANGELOG.md files for long description, importing version info from getmac.getmac, and reading system version info via sys and open.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data outputs or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reads into variables (long_description), and from version import into setup parameters. No external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious logic. The code appears straightforward, focused on package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script loads project metadata from files, defines package setup parameters, and configures entry points for command-line usage. It conditionally assigns different console scripts based on Python version. All operations are standard for Python package setup and contain no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It only handles package metadata and configuration, with no external communications or harmful code.",
