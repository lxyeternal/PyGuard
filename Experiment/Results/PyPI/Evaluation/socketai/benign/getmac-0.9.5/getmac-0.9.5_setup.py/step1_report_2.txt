{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package named 'getmac', used for retrieving MAC addresses of remote hosts and local interfaces.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md and CHANGELOG.md files for long_description; imports version info from getmac.getmac; reads sys.version_info for conditional logic",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; the code primarily loads files, sets package metadata, and defines setup parameters. No execution of untrusted data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Reads files to construct long_description, then passes metadata to setuptools.setup() without executing untrusted data or code; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code performs standard package setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a typical setup routine for a Python package, including reading files for long_description, importing version info, and calling setuptools.setup() with package metadata. No code execution, network calls, or dynamic imports are present. No obfuscated or suspicious constructs are identified. The logic is straightforward and intended for package distribution purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Python package setup configuration with no malicious behavior detected. It reads package metadata from local files and prepares the package for distribution without executing untrusted code or performing any suspicious actions.",
