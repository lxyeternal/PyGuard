  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a legitimate, multi-platform utility for MAC address retrieval. The main security concern is the unsafe handling of user inputs in subprocess command strings, which could be exploited for command injection if inputs are malicious. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage are present. The malware score is 0.1, reflecting the command injection potential but no malicious code. The obfuscation score is 0.0. The security risk score is approximately 0.2, mainly due to unsafe command string construction practices that can be mitigated by input sanitization."
