{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be benign, with no suspicious activity, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected. It is either incomplete, empty, or straightforward in nature.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs identified; code does not read or process untrusted data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network connections, file writes, or environment variable leaks observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code does not process or transmit data.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The provided code snippets are either empty, placeholders, or contain standard, benign operations. Multiple reports confirm the lack of malicious signals, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. Confidence levels are high where code exists, and low where code is absent, appropriately reflecting the limited context. Scores for malware and obfuscation are consistently zero, with low security risk scores (0.1-0.2) justified by the benign nature and incomplete information.",
  "conclusion": "All reports correctly assess the code as benign with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores are consistent with the analysis, indicating a safe dependency with no security concerns.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
