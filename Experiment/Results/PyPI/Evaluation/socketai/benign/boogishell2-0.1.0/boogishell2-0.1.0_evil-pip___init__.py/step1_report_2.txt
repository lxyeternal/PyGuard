  "anomalies": "The code contains no unusual or suspicious constructs, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated sections. It appears to be straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The provided code appears empty or non-informative; there are no operations, imports, functions, or executable statements present. Without actual code content, there are no observable behaviors, data sources, or sinks to analyze. The lack of code prevents any assessment of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of code content, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The code appears benign or possibly incomplete. No malicious or suspicious activity can be inferred.",
