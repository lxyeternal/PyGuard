  "purpose": "Customize the installation process of the 'boogishell2' package, including running additional commands after installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the system using os.popen to execute 'ls /'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially dangerous commands are commented out; if enabled, they could initiate a reverse shell or network connection.",
  "flows": "The source from os.popen('ls /') flows into printing output; no malicious data flow is present unless the commented code is activated.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a commented-out reverse shell command indicates possible malicious intent or testing; running system commands during install is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that executes 'ls /' during installation and prints the result. There is a commented line that, if uncommented, could establish a reverse shell connection to an external IP, which is malicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials or data leaks are present. Usage of os.popen is noted but not malicious by itself. The commented reverse shell suggests possible malicious or maliciously intended capabilities, but currently inactive. Overall, the code could be used maliciously if the commented code is activated, but as-is, it only performs benign listing of root directory.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains suspicious commented-out reverse shell code, indicating potential malicious intent if activated. The active code performs benign system listing. The overall risk is low unless the commented code is used, but the presence of such code warrants caution.",
