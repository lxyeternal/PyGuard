{
  "purpose": "This code defines a registry of transport classes for an agent system, facilitating selection among gRPC, asyncio, and REST transports.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.base, .grpc, .grpc_asyncio, .rest) and internal dictionary initialization.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output operations; no data leaks or external communication points.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; code simply registers classes in a dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code structure is standard for a registry module.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific transport classes, creates an ordered dictionary to register them, and exposes these classes via __all__. It appears to be a straightforward registry setup without any external input handling, malicious logic, or obfuscation. No signs of suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard registry module for transport classes with no malicious intent or security issues identified. It does not contain malware or security risks.",
