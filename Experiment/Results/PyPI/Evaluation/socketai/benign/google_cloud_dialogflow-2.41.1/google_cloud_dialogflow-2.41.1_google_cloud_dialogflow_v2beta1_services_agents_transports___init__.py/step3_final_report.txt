  "purpose": "Register transport classes for a client SDK, including gRPC, asyncio, and REST transports.",
  "sources": "Imports of transport classes from local modules.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Registration of transport classes into an ordered dictionary without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup module that imports specific transport classes and registers them in an ordered dictionary for SDK use. It contains no dynamic execution, external input handling, or network activity. The license comments are standard. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and clarity support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK registry setup with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
