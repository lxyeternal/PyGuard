{
  "purpose": "The code defines and registers different transport classes for an agent system, likely for gRPC and REST communication methods, and exports relevant components for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.base, .grpc, .grpc_asyncio, .rest), and the _transport_registry dictionary which is populated with class references.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sink where untrusted data is processed; the code is primarily defining and registering classes and constants.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input to sensitive operations. The registry maps strings to class types, which are used elsewhere in the application.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code appears straightforward and standard for a module defining transport mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary classes, creates an ordered dictionary to register transport classes, populates this dictionary with static class references, and defines __all__ for module exports. There are no dynamic code executions, no use of eval or exec, no hardcoded credentials, and no network operations or data leaks. It is a standard module setup for defining and exporting transport classes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical module for registering transport classes for a client library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It does not perform any data processing or network operations itself and appears safe.",
