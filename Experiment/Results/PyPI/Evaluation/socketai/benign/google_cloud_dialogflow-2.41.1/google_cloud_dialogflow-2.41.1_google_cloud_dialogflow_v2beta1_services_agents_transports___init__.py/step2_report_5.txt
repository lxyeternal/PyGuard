  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and assess the scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward registry setup for transport classes in a client SDK.\n- The code only imports classes, registers them in an ordered dictionary, and exposes them via `__all__`.\n- No dynamic code, user input, external data processing, or network activity.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- The license comments are standard and do not suggest malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues present?**  \n  No. The code is a simple registry setup with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, mistakes?**  \n  None apparent. The code appears correct and standard for its purpose.\n\n- **Scores given by reports:**  \n  All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n  - `confidence`: 1\n\n  These are reasonable given the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Critical review of each report:\n\n**Report 1-5:**\n- All describe the code as a standard, benign setup module.\n- No anomalies, no suspicious behaviors.\n- No external data sinks or flows involving untrusted data.\n- The reasoning is consistent with the code.\n\n**Scores:**\n- `malware`: 0 — correct.\n- `obfuscated`: 0 — correct.\n- `securityRisk`: 0 — correct.\n- `confidence`: 1 — justified, as the analysis is clear and comprehensive.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- **Potential risks or concerns?**  \n  None. The code is purely static class registration, typical in SDKs.\n- **Malicious activity or backdoors?**  \n  No evidence.\n- **Obfuscation or hidden code?**  \n  No.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The reports are accurate and reasonable.\n- The scores align with the code's nature.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, just for completeness, but effectively zero)\n\nThe code is benign, standard SDK setup, with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports correctly identify the code as safe, with appropriate scoring. The code is a straightforward, non-malicious registry setup for transport classes, with no signs of obfuscation, malware, or security risks.",
