{
  "purpose": "This code defines and registers different transport classes for a client library, allowing selection between gRPC, async gRPC, and REST transports.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library (collections, typing), relative imports from local modules (.base, .grpc, .grpc_asyncio, .rest)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; the code only sets up class mappings and exports",
  "flows": "N/A - No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; mainly initialization and registry setup",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports modules, creates an ordered dictionary to register transport classes, and defines __all__ for exports. It appears to be a standard module setup for client transport configuration. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or network activity is present. The licensing comment is standard and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, benign setup for transport class registration in a client library. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident.",
