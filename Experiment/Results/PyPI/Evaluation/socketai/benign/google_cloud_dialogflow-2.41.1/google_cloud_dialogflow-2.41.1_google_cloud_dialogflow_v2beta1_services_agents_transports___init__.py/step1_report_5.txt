{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up and register different transport mechanisms for an API client, specifically gRPC and REST transports.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.base, .grpc, .grpc_asyncio, .rest), and the creation of a registry dictionary.",
  "sinks": "None of the code explicitly writes data to external sources or performs data leaks; the registry simply maps transport types to classes.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data sources are processed; the code only initializes a dictionary with class references.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious logic. The code is straightforward and standard for a transport registry setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific transport classes and creates an ordered dictionary to map transport names to classes, then exposes these via __all__ for external use. It does not handle user input, external data, or perform any network operations. No obfuscation, malicious code, or anomalies are present. The license and copyright comments indicate proper open-source licensing. The code's simplicity and clarity suggest it's a standard setup module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard registry setup for transport classes in an API client. It contains no malicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious logic. It appears to be safe and intended for organizational purposes within a larger project.",
