  "purpose": "This code is a standard licensing header containing only comments and licensing information, with no executable logic or data processing.",
  "sources": "There are no sources of input or data in the code snippet; it consists solely of comments.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects, as the code contains only comments.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths exist, since there is no executable code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or unusual code behavior are present; the code is a benign license header.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely a licensing comment block with no executable statements, data handling, or dynamic behavior. All reports correctly identify it as a benign, standard license header. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned by the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code content. No anomalies or suspicious signals are detected. The code poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign licensing header with no security concerns, malware, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No further action or escalation is necessary.",
