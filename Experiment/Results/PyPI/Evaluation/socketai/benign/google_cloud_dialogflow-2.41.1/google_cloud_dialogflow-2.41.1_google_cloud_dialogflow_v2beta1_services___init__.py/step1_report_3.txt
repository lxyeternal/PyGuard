  "flows": "No data flows or execution flows are observable in this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is only a comment block with licensing information; no suspicious or unusual behavior is detected.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is a standard license header with no executable or dynamic code present. It contains no code that reads input, writes output, or performs any actions that could be malicious. It is a typical boilerplate licensing comment found at the top of source files, indicating legal licensing terms. Since there are no code constructs, variables, or functions, there is no risk of malware or security issues within this snippet.",
