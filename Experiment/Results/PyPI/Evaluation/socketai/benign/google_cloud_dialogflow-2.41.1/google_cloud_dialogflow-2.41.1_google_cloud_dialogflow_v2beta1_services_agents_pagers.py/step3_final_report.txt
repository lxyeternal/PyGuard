{
  "purpose": "Provides classes for iterating through paginated API responses for search agents in Google Dialogflow, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous iteration.",
  "sources": "API method calls (_method), request objects (_request), response objects (_response), retry configurations, metadata, and page tokens.",
  "sinks": "API calls within iteration loops, potentially untrusted page tokens used to fetch subsequent pages.",
  "flows": "Request objects are updated with next_page_token from responses; subsequent API calls fetch additional pages; data flows from API responses through iteration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard SDK pagination patterns for Google API responses, with proper handling of request/response objects, retries, and async support. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The use of page tokens is typical for API pagination and controlled by the API provider. No anomalies or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of API response pagination classes for Google Dialogflow. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or backdoor elements. The low security risk scores assigned are appropriate given the context, primarily due to handling untrusted page tokens which is standard in such SDKs.",
