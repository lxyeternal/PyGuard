  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the accuracy of their assessments, as well as the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code snippets are very minimal, consisting solely of import statements, an __all__ declaration, and licensing comments.\n- No dynamic code, network activity, or data handling is present.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are evident.\n- The reports uniformly conclude benign, standard SDK module code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Analysis:\n\n**Presence of issues:**\n- The code matches the original provided; no issues or malicious code are present.\n- All reports correctly identify the code as standard, benign SDK module setup.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n- None of the reports contain logical errors or misconceptions.\n- They all accurately describe the code as straightforward, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n- None of the reports suggest any risk that warrants a score above 0.5. The code is purely structural, with no runtime behavior or data handling.\n\n**Challenging assumptions:**\n- The reports assume that import statements and __all__ declarations are harmless, which is correct.\n- No assumptions about hidden malware or vulnerabilities are made; all conclusions are justified.\n\n**Consistency of scores:**\n- All scores are consistent with the code content and analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:**  \n- Confirmed as 0 in all reports, which is correct.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**  \n- Confirmed as 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n\n**Risk score:**  \n- All reports rightfully assign 0, indicating no security risk.\n\n---\n\n### My own evaluation:\n\nGiven the code's simplicity and the reports' correctness, I agree with the current scores. The code is a standard module export pattern for SDK classes, with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n### Final conclusion:\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security risks. The scores reflect this appropriately.\n\n**Summary:**\n- No issues found.\n- No suspicious or malicious activity.\n- Scores are correct and justified.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nAccept the current assessment; no changes needed.",
