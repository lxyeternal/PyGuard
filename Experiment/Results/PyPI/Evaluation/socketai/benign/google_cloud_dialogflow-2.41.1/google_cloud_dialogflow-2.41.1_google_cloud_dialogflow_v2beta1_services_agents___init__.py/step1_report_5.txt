  "purpose": "Module exports for Google LLC's agent client classes, facilitating asynchronous and synchronous interactions.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .async_client and .client",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external interactions observed",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely defines exports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports two classes from local modules and exposes them via __all__ for external use. It contains only standard import and export statements with licensing and copyright comments. No data input, output, or dynamic code execution is present. No indicators of malicious activity or security risks are visible.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module export configuration with no malicious behavior or security issues detected. It appears to be a standard, benign part of a larger SDK or library.",
