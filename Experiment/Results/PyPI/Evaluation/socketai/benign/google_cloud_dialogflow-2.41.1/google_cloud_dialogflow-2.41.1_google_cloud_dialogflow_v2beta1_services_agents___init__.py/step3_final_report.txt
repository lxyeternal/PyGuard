{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer that imports and exposes client classes for an SDK, facilitating their use elsewhere.",
  "sources": "Import statements from sibling modules (.async_client and .client). No external input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no network or file operations, no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Import statements and __all__ declaration, with no data or control flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or hidden instructions detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard Python module for exporting classes, with licensing comments. It contains only import and export declarations, no dynamic code, data processing, or network activity. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and transparency. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are present. The code aligns with typical SDK module patterns and poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module setup for exposing client classes in an SDK. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk. The assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
