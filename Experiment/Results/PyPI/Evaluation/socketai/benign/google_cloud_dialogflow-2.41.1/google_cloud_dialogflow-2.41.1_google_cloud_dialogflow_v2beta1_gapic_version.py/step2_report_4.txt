  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Report 1**:\n   - **Summary**: The code is a license header and version info, with no data flows or malicious behavior.\n   - **Assessment**: Correct. The code is benign, consisting solely of comments and a version string.\n   - **Scores**:\n     - Malware: 0 (appropriate)\n     - Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)\n     - Security Risk: 0 (appropriate)\n   - **Conclusion**: No issues here.\n\n2. **Report 2**:\n   - **Summary**: Similar to report 1, with license comments and version string; no suspicious activity.\n   - **Assessment**: Correct. The code is harmless.\n   - **Scores**:\n     - Malware: 0 (appropriate)\n     - Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)\n     - Security Risk: 0 (appropriate)\n   - **Conclusion**: No issues.\n\n3. **Report 3**:\n   - **Summary**: License and version info, no data processing or external communication.\n   - **Assessment**: Correct. No malicious or suspicious behavior.\n   - **Scores**:\n     - Malware: 0 (appropriate)\n     - Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)\n     - Security Risk: 0 (appropriate)\n   - **Conclusion**: No issues.\n\n4. **Report 4**:\n   - **Summary**: Metadata/license info, no data flows or external calls.\n   - **Assessment**: Correct.\n   - **Scores**:\n     - Malware: 0 (appropriate)\n     - Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)\n     - Security Risk: 0 (appropriate)\n   - **Conclusion**: No issues.\n\n5. **Report 5**:\n   - **Summary**: Standard license and version info, no suspicious activity.\n   - **Assessment**: Correct.\n   - **Scores**:\n     - Malware: 0 (appropriate)\n     - Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)\n     - Security Risk: 0 (appropriate)\n   - **Conclusion**: No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is purely metadata and licensing comments with no executable logic, data flows, or external interactions.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent and reasonable.\n- No evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score**: Should remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscated score**: Should remain at 0.\n- **Risk score**: Should remain at 0.\n\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of this code snippet, I agree with the assessments provided. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Summary**:\n- The code is a standard open-source license header with version info.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security issues are present.\n- The current scoring and reasoning are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My estimated scores**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0",
