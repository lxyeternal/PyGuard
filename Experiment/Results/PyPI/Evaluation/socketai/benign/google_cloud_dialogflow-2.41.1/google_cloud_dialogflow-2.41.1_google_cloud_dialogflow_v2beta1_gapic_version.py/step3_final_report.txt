{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a license header and version identifier for an open-source Python module, providing licensing information and versioning metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it contains static comments and a version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code is purely static metadata.",
  "flows": "No data flows exist; the code does not process or transmit data, only defines a version variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is standard boilerplate with comments and a version assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static header with licensing comments and a version string. It contains no executable logic, data processing, or external interactions. The absence of inputs, outputs, or malicious patterns indicates it is benign. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, reflecting the harmless nature. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard license header with no malicious or security concerns. The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
