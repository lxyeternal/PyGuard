  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be the installation or setup of a Python package, possibly including some configuration or environment setup.",
  "sources": "Data is read from environment variables, import statements, and potentially user input via standard input or configuration files.",
  "sinks": "Data may flow into network connections, file operations, or environment variable manipulations, but specific sinks are not clearly visible due to lack of detailed code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or input sources to functions that may handle file or network operations; without specific code, detailed flow mapping is limited.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. Unusual use of dynamic imports or configuration may warrant further review, but none are evident here.",
  "analysis": "The code is absent or minimal; due to lack of specific implementation details, the review is based on typical patterns. No signs of malicious behavior, suspicious data handling, or malicious obfuscation are present. The code appears benign, focused on setup or configuration without evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems to serve a standard setup or configuration purpose with no anomalies detected.",
