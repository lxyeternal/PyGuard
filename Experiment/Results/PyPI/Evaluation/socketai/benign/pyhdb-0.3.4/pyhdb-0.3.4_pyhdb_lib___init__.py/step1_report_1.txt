  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be related to a Python package intended for general use, possibly involving data processing or utility functions. There is no explicit indication of malicious intent based solely on the visible code.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, configuration files, or function parameters. No direct user input or external data sources are explicitly shown in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands, but none are evident in the current code fragment. If present, these would be the points where data could be leaked or malicious actions triggered.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or inputs through functions or processing routines to sinks like output functions or external systems. No explicit source-to-sink paths are identifiable without further code context.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are detected. The code uses standard libraries and appears structured normally. There is no obfuscation or unnecessary dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "A step-by-step review shows the code is straightforward, utilizing common Python patterns. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or unauthorized system access, are observed. The code does not contain hardcoded credentials or suspicious network activity. Without additional context, it appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems to serve a legitimate purpose with no evident signs of sabotage or malware.",
