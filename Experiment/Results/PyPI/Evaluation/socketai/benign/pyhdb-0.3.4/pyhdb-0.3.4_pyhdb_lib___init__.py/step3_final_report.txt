  "purpose": "The code appears to be a straightforward Python package with no malicious intent, primarily involved in setup or configuration tasks.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, configuration files, or parameters, which are standard data sources.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data leaks are present; no untrusted data flows identified.",
  "flows": "No suspicious source-to-sink data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is simple and standard, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. Confidence is high (0.8). No suspicious data flows or anomalies are present. The lack of malicious indicators supports a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation detected. The low security risk score (0.2) is appropriate given the minimal inherent risk in setup code. Malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and overall security risk is low.",
