{
  "purpose": "This code implements a Python driver for SAP HANA, managing prepared statements, execution, and result processing with standard patterns. It handles parameter substitution, request/response communication, and result fetching.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for SQL statements, server responses containing result sets and metadata.",
  "sinks": "Network requests sent via 'send_request', SQL commands constructed with 'format_operation', and data returned from server responses.",
  "flows": "Parameters are processed through 'escape_values' and formatted into SQL commands; commands are sent over the network; responses are parsed and stored in buffer or result sets.",
  "anomalies": "Uses string interpolation ('operation % e_values') in 'format_operation', which could pose SQL injection risks if 'escape_values' does not fully sanitize inputs. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical database driver pattern, with prepared statement management, execution, and result handling. The use of 'escape_values' suggests sanitization, but the reliance on string formatting introduces potential injection risks if sanitization is incomplete. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious network activity are present. The overall structure and behavior align with standard driver implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate and standard for a SAP HANA Python driver. The primary security concern is the potential for SQL injection if 'escape_values' does not fully sanitize inputs, but no malicious activity or sabotage is evident. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate given the potential injection risk without active exploitation.",
