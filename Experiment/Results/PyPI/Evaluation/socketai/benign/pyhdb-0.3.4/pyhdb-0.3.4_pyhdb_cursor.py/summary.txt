  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate and standard for a SAP HANA Python driver. The primary security concern is the potential for SQL injection if 'escape_values' does not fully sanitize inputs, but no malicious activity or sabotage is evident. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate given the potential injection risk without active exploitation."
