  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious behaviors, obfuscation, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a SAP HANA Python driver, handling prepared statements, execution, and result processing. No malicious behaviors or obfuscation are evident. The only concern is that 'escape_values' and string formatting could pose SQL injection risks if sanitization is inadequate.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code. The low risk score is appropriate given the potential for SQL injection if external sanitization fails, but no malicious intent is present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it describes a legitimate SAP HANA driver with standard features. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable. The code is standard, with no signs of sabotage.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a typical driver with standard request/response handling. No malicious or obfuscated code, and the use of string formatting is typical for such drivers.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. No malicious signals or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, standard driver code with no malicious intent. The main concern is the use of string interpolation, which could lead to SQL injection if parameters are not sanitized.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The risk score is justified, but no malware or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above; a legitimate driver with typical features. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the code clarity and lack of obfuscation techniques.\n\n- **Risk Score:** The main concern across reports is potential SQL injection via string formatting. The assigned risk score of 0.2 reflects a low but noteworthy security concern, which is reasonable.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation techniques observed)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (minor concern about SQL injection if sanitization is inadequate)\n\n**Note:** The code appears to be a standard, legitimate SAP HANA Python driver with no malicious or sabotage intent. The main security consideration is ensuring proper sanitization of parameters to prevent SQL injection, which is a common concern in database drivers using string formatting.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- All reports are consistent and reasonable in their scoring.  \n- No changes needed.  \n- The overall assessment aligns with the evidence: **benign, standard database driver code with a minor security concern regarding input sanitization.**",
