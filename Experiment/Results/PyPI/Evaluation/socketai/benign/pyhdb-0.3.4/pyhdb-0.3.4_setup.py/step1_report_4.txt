  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package named 'pyhdb', intended to package and distribute the SAP HANA Database Client for Python.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from a 'VERSION' file and the long description from a 'README.rst' file. No external data sources or user input handling observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform actions based on untrusted input; primarily file reading and package setup operations.",
  "flows": "Reads static files to retrieve version and description information, then passes this data to the setup() function for package creation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns detected. The code follows standard package setup procedures. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and uses them to define package metadata for distribution. It securely reads version info and long description from local files. The code structure and functions are straightforward and typical for Python package setup scripts. No dynamic code execution, network access, or data manipulation that could indicate malicious intent. All operations are related solely to package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It functions solely to configure and prepare the package for distribution.",
