  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging the 'pyhdb' library, reading version and description from local files, and invoking setuptools.setup() with package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads 'VERSION' file for version info, 'README.rst' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no dynamic code execution or network activity.",
  "flows": "Reads local files and passes data to setup(), with no external or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static file reads and setup invocation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with static file reads and a call to setuptools.setup(). It contains no user input handling, network activity, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. All operations are standard for package configuration. The code is syntactically correct, and no malicious or security-compromising behavior is evident. The provided reports correctly identify the benign nature of this script, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of zero with high confidence.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
