  "purpose": "Setup script for the Python package 'pyhdb', used to package and distribute the SAP HANA Database Client for Python.",
  "sources": "Reading VERSION file for version information; reading README.rst for long description.",
  "sinks": "None observed. No untrusted data handling, no external network communication or file modifications outside reading files.",
  "flows": "Reading version and description files during setup process; no untrusted data flow to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors detected. The code follows standard setup script conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and defines functions to read version and description files, then calls 'setup()' with package metadata. No dynamic code execution, no external data manipulation beyond reading files, no network activity, and no suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a typical setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It reads static files and calls 'setup()' with package info. No anomalies or malware detected.",
