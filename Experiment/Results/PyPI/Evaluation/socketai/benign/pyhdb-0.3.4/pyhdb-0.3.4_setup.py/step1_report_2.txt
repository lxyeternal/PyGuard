{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configurations for packaging and distributing a Python module named 'pyhdb', which is an SAP HANA Database Client for Python.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'VERSION' file to determine the package version; reading the 'README.rst' file for the long description; no other data sources or input mechanisms.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function ultimately writes package metadata to the package distribution; no untrusted data sinks are involved in data processing or execution.",
  "flows": "The code reads external files ('VERSION' and 'README.rst') to gather data used in setup metadata, then passes this data into setup() for package configuration; no user input or untrusted data flows into sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. The code strictly performs standard setup procedures, with no dynamic code execution or network operations.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and defines functions to read version and description files, then invokes setup() with package metadata. All file reads are straightforward and controlled, without any dynamic or untrusted input handling. The setup configuration aligns with typical packaging practices and does not exhibit any malicious patterns or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library and contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It reads necessary metadata files and invokes the setup function without performing any suspicious actions.",
