{
  "purpose": "Implements SCRAM-SHA256 authentication protocol, generating client proof and handling server communication.",
  "sources": "os.urandom for client key generation, input parameters (user, password), network communication via self.connection.send_request()",
  "sinks": "cryptographic functions (hashlib, hmac), network request/response handling",
  "flows": "client key generated via os.urandom -> cryptographic proof calculation -> send request to server -> receive response -> verify/authenticate",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, suspicious code patterns, or unusual data leaks observed",
  "analysis": "The code follows standard cryptographic procedures for SCRAM-SHA256 authentication, correctly using os.urandom for secure randomness, hashlib and hmac for hashing, and proper message construction. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or sabotage are present. The cryptographic practices are sound, and the data flow aligns with expected authentication flows. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and does not contain obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of SCRAM-SHA256 authentication with no signs of malicious intent or security flaws. It employs proper cryptographic practices and communicates securely. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2) are justified and appropriate.",
