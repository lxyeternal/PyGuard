  "purpose": "This code manages SCRAM-SHA256 authentication handshake for a database connection, generating cryptographic proofs to authenticate a user securely.",
  "sources": "User credentials (password), connection object, server response segments containing salt and server key.",
  "sinks": "Cryptographic functions, hashing, and HMAC operations; no direct data leaks or untrusted data effect are evident.",
  "flows": "User password and connection data are used to generate client proof via salt and server key; proofs are sent to authenticate.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. Uses standard cryptographic libraries properly.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a cryptographic handshake using SCRAM-SHA256, involving salt and server key exchange, proof calculation, and HMAC operations. No insecure practices like code injection or unsafe data handling are evident. The cryptographic operations appear standard and correctly implemented. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns detected. All inputs are handled within cryptographic functions without apparent data leaks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a standard SCRAM authentication mechanism with proper cryptographic practices. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or suspicious anomalies identified. The code appears to be a legitimate, security-focused implementation.",
