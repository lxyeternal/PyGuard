  "purpose": "Implement SCRAM-SHA256 authentication handshake for a database connection",
  "sources": "os.urandom, self.password.encode, input data in perform_handshake method, response from connection.send_request",
  "sinks": "self.client_proof, returned Authentication object, hashlib.sha256 and hmac.new for cryptographic operations",
  "flows": "os.urandom generates self.client_key -> perform_handshake uses it to create request -> server responds with auth data -> calculate_client_proof uses salt and server_key -> scramble_salt processes salts and keys -> returns proof",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.urandom for cryptographic key generation, no obvious hardcoded secrets, proper cryptographic functions used, no external data leaks or suspicious network activity detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard SCRAM-SHA256 authentication handshake, generating cryptographically secure random keys and computing proofs with established hash functions. The cryptographic operations follow standard procedures without suspicious modifications. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. The use of os.urandom and cryptographic libraries appears legitimate. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a typical, well-structured SCRAM-SHA256 authentication mechanism with no signs of malicious intent or security compromise. It appears to be part of a secure authentication process for a database client library.",
