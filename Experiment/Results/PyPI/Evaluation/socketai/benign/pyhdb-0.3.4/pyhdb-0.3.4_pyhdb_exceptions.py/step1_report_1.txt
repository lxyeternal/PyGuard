{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for database-related errors in a Python application, primarily for error handling and classification.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the constructor parameters of the exception classes, especially 'message' and 'code' in DatabaseError.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is directly used in sensitive operations; the code solely defines exception classes without executing or handling external input.",
  "flows": "Input data (error messages, codes) flow into exception constructors but are not processed or used in any potentially unsafe manner beyond message storage.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code appears straightforward with standard class inheritance and exception handling patterns. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for database errors, which inherit from built-in exceptions. The only dynamic operation is the passing of error messages and optional codes to superclass constructors. The use of 'super' and class inheritance is standard. There are no external data reads, network calls, or suspicious logic. Overall, this is a typical error handling module without malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exception classes for database error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues.",
