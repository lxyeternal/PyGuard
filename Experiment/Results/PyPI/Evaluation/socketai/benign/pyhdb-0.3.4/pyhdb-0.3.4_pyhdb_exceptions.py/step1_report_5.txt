{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for database error handling following a specific licensing and import setup.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no points where untrusted data could cause a data leak or effect.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input or output; the code only defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard exception class definitions with no unusual behavior or code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports __future__.absolute_import to ensure compatibility across Python versions. It defines several custom exception classes for database-related errors, inheriting from built-in exceptions like Error, Warning, and specific database error subclasses. The constructors are straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, no handling of external data, and no unusual patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic are present. The code is purely structural, serving as a set of custom exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard and benign, intended for structured exception handling in database operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
