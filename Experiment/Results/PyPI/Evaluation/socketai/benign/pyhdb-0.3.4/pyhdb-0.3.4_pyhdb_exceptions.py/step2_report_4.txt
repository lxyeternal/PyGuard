  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward set of custom exception classes for database error handling.\n- It uses standard inheritance and constructor patterns.\n- There are no external data reads, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The purpose is purely structural, to facilitate error handling in a larger application.\n\n**Scores and justifications:**\n\n- **Malware score (0):** All reports agree that there is no malicious activity. The code is purely class definitions with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score (0):** No obfuscation is present; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk score (0):** No external data handling, no injection points, no secrets, no network activity. The code is benign.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n\n- The only aspect worth noting is the use of `super()` with explicit arguments, which is standard and safe.\n- No evidence of malicious intent, supply chain attack, or malicious obfuscation.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- The code is a typical, benign implementation of custom exception classes.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code content.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious or security issues. The scoring aligns with the analysis, and I agree with the provided assessments.",
