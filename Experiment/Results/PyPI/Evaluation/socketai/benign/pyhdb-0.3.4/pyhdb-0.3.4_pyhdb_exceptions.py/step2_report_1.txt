  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code review summary:**\n- The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for database errors.\n- It imports `absolute_import` from `__future__` for compatibility.\n- Exception classes include `Error`, `Warning`, `InterfaceError`, `DatabaseError`, and specific subclasses like `InternalError`, `OperationalError`, etc.\n- The constructors accept message and optional code parameters, passing them to the superclass constructors.\n- No external data is read, no input processing, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- The code appears to be a standard, benign error handling module.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** None. The code is straightforward and standard. No vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or obfuscation detected.\n\n### Logical and reasoning flaws:\n- **Errors or mistakes:** None observed. The class hierarchy and constructor implementations are correct and conventional.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate. No malicious activity or payloads.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is appropriate. The code is clear and standard.\n- **Security risk score:** 0 is appropriate. No external data handling, no injection points, no secrets.\n\n### Risk justification:\n- All scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n- The code is purely structural, defining exception classes, with no external data processing or dynamic behavior.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- The reports assume the code is benign, which aligns with the actual code content.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are unjustified; the code is safe.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n---\n\n### Personal estimate:\nGiven the comprehensive review, I agree with the provided scores. The code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes with no security issues.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis supply chain component appears safe and benign.",
