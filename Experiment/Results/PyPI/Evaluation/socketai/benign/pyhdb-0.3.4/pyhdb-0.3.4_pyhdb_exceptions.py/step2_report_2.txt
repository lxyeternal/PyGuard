  "review": "Let's systematically analyze the reports and the code:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Code:**\n   - The code only defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes.\n   - There are no external data reads, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - The parameters passed to exceptions (messages and codes) are standard and controlled.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious intent.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident; the assessments are consistent with the code's simplicity.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - Given the code's nature, these scores are reasonable and should not be increased.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The code does not perform any dynamic operations, external data handling, or security-sensitive actions.\n   - Therefore, risk scores higher than 0.5 are unwarranted.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - No malicious activity is present; the malware score should remain at 0.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports are cautious and base their conclusions on the absence of suspicious patterns.\n   - No assumptions are made that could lead to false positives.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's purpose and structure.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation or code hiding techniques)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThis code is a straightforward, standard implementation of custom exception classes for database error handling. It is benign, well-structured, and poses no security threat. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain at zero across all categories.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nMaintain the current scores; no adjustments are necessary.",
