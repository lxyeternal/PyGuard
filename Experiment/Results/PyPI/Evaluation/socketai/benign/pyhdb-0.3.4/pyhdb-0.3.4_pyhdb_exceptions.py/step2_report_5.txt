  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues:**  \n   The code is a straightforward set of custom exception classes for database error handling. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code does not process external data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. It only defines classes with constructors passing messages and optional codes.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**  \n   The reports correctly identify that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious intent. They consistently note the absence of external data handling, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. No logical flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**  \n   All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The confidence scores are all 1.0, reflecting certainty.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**  \n   Since the code is purely structural, with no external data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution, raising the risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified. The same applies to malware and obfuscation scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis. There is no indication of malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \n   All reports avoid assumptions about potential vulnerabilities; they focus on what the code actually does. This is appropriate.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Security Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Estimated scores:**  \nGiven the evidence, I concur with the provided scores. The code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exception classes for database error handling.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The code is a typical, safe implementation with no malicious or obfuscated content.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.",
