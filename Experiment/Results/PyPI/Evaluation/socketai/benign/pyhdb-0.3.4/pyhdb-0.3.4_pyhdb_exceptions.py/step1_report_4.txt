{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for database-related error handling, following standard practice for structured error management.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted input sources; code only defines classes and imports.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or output functions.",
  "flows": "No data flows; class definitions do not process or transfer data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; code is straightforward, well-structured, and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'absolute_import' for compatibility, then defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for database error handling. Each class extends base exception classes with no dynamic code execution, no input processing, or external data interaction. No hardcoded secrets, malicious patterns, or obfuscated code are present. The code strictly adheres to standard error class definitions, with the only parameters being error messages and optional codes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for database error management. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears safe and purposeful for structured error handling.",
