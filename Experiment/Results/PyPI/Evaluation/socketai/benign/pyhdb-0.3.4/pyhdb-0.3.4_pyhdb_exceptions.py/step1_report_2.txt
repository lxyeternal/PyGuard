{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for database-related errors, adhering to standard error handling conventions.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink; the code only defines exception classes and constructors.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions for various custom exception types related to database errors. It uses inheritance from built-in exceptions and standard super() calls. No input handling, external data processing, or suspicious constructs are present. The code appears to be a standard implementation of error classes with proper use of inheritance and constructors. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of custom exception classes for database errors with no malicious intent or security concerns. It appears to be a legitimate component for error handling in a larger database-related project.",
