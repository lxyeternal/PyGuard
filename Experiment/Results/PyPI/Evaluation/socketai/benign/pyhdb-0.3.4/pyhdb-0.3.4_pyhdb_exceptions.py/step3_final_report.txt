{
  "purpose": "Defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for database error handling, facilitating structured error management in database applications.",
  "sources": "Class constructors accepting message and optional code parameters; no external data reads or input sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling; exception messages are standard and controlled.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of exception objects with messages and codes; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes inheriting from built-in exceptions, with constructors passing messages and optional codes. It contains no external data reads, network calls, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. The structure is standard, and no malicious or security-sensitive operations are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign, structural nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of database error exception classes with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero across all categories.",
