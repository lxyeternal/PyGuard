{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for database error handling, providing structured error types for use in a database-related Python application.",
  "sources": "Code imports from __future__ for compatibility; class constructors and inheritance; potential message and code parameters in exceptions.",
  "sinks": "Exception raising and inheritance, primarily for control flow and error reporting within an application.",
  "flows": "Not applicable: the code only defines classes and does not process untrusted data or execute input-based logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code strictly defines exception classes without external data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a series of custom exception classes inheriting from Python's built-in Exception and Warning classes. It includes a hierarchy tailored for database error handling, with constructors passing messages and optional codes. The only input-like elements are parameters for exception instantiation, which are standard and controlled. There are no dynamic code executions, obfuscation, or external data handling mechanisms. The code's structure and purpose align with conventional practices for exception management, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, benign implementation of custom exception classes for database error handling. There are no indicators of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. The code appears safe and standard for its purpose.",
