{
  "purpose": "Provides compatibility functions for Python 2 and 3, including version detection, type definitions, and utility functions.",
  "sources": "Reads Python version information from sys.version_info, imports modules like sys, configparser, itertools, and defines compatibility variables and functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling; code does not process external input or write data.",
  "flows": "Uses sys.version_info to determine environment, assigns types and functions based on version, defines compatibility utility functions.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a standard compatibility layer, with no suspicious or unusual code behavior. The unichr lambda for narrow builds is a typical workaround. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a compatibility utility that adapts code behavior between Python 2 and 3. It inspects Python version and sets appropriate type definitions and functions. It includes a function for checking if an object is text. The use of standard library imports and well-known compatibility patterns indicates normal functionality. No suspicious code, malicious logic, or obfuscation detected. The overall structure is straightforward and typical for cross-version support modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard compatibility layer for supporting multiple Python versions. It contains no malware or malicious behavior and presents no security risks. It simply defines environment-specific types and functions. Confidence in this assessment is high.",
