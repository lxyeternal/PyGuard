{
  "purpose": "Provides compatibility utilities for Python 2 and 3, including type definitions and version-specific imports.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, sys.maxunicode, standard library modules (configparser, itertools, sys).",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Input from sys (version info) influences variable definitions; no data flow from untrusted sources to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns present. The code is standard for compatibility handling.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages compatibility between Python 2 and 3 by defining types, imports, and utility functions. It uses sys to determine Python version, sets type aliases, and handles unicode/narrow build issues. The with_metaclass function creates a metaclass-compatible class, and is_text checks for string types. All components are standard, well-known techniques, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical compatibility utility script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It does not contain obfuscation or malware indicators and functions solely to facilitate cross-version Python compatibility.",
