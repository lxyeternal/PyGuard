  "purpose": "Compatibility layer for Python 2 and 3, handling version detection, type definitions, imports, and utility functions like with_metaclass and is_text.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, sys.maxunicode, standard library imports (configparser, itertools), environment variables indirectly via sys, but none explicitly used in code.",
  "sinks": "None; code does not process untrusted input, write data externally, or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Version detection from sys.version_info flows into type definitions and import choices; no external data flows or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Lambda workaround for narrow Unicode builds is a known compatibility pattern, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward compatibility utility for Python 2 and 3, involving version detection, type aliasing, conditional imports, and utility functions. It contains no network activity, data sinks, or processing of untrusted input. The lambda for narrow Unicode builds is a standard workaround. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present. The code's purpose is purely to ensure compatibility across Python versions, and all signals point to benign, well-understood patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility utility with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
