  "purpose": "Define compatibility functions and type checks for different Python versions.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, sys.maxunicode",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data sinks for untrusted input are present",
  "flows": "None; no data flow from sources to sinks identified",
  "anomalies": "Use of lambda to redefine unichr for narrow Unicode builds; extensive version compatibility code, but no malicious activity",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides compatibility abstractions for different Python versions, including type definitions, imports, and functions like with_metaclass and is_text. It checks Python version and unicode build details, then defines or redefines functions accordingly. The only notable anomaly is the lambda for unichr in narrow Unicode builds, which is a compatibility workaround. No network, file, or environment interactions, nor data manipulation beyond compatibility handling, are present. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard compatibility layer for Python 2 and 3, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It is safe and appears to be a benign utility module.",
