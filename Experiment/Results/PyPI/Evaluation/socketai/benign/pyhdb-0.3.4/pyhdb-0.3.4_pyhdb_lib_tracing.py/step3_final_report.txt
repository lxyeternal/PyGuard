  "purpose": "A debugging utility for tracing and printing detailed information about network protocol message objects in pyhdb, aiding in inspection and troubleshooting.",
  "sources": "Object attributes accessed via getattr, including nested structures and attribute dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "Formatted output to stdout and internal io.StringIO buffer; no external data transfer or network activity.",
  "flows": "Attribute retrieval from trace_obj and its nested elements, followed by formatted printing to buffer or stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected; straightforward attribute inspection and printing.",
  "analysis": "The code performs recursive attribute inspection and formatted printing for debugging purposes. It relies on standard Python features and a global flag for tracing activation. No external network, file, or environment variable manipulation occurs. The logic is transparent, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. The code is safe and solely for debugging, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign debugging utility for inspecting pyhdb message objects. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscation scores should be zero, and the security risk is negligible. The minor security risk score of 0.2 in one report can be adjusted to 0 for consistency.",
