  "conclusion": "This is a benign debugging utility for inspecting pyhdb message objects. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscation scores should be zero, and the security risk is negligible. The minor security risk score of 0.2 in one report can be adjusted to 0 for consistency."
