  "purpose": "Defines a custom CESU-8 codec with incremental and stream encoding/decoding classes, registered via Python's codecs module for specialized character encoding.",
  "sources": "Input data received by encode/decode functions, processing of input byte sequences and Unicode strings.",
  "sinks": "Encoded byte sequences output by encode functions; decoded Unicode strings output by decode functions.",
  "flows": "Input Unicode strings flow into _buffer_encode, producing bytes; input bytes flow into _buffer_decode, producing Unicode strings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, network activity, or obfuscation detected. The custom encoding logic could be misused for obfuscation but is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard custom codec for CESU-8, handling surrogate pairs explicitly, with registration for use in Python. No external system interactions or malicious patterns are present. The logic is straightforward, with proper handling of surrogate sequences. The code is well-structured, with no obfuscation or backdoors. The security implications are minimal; the code performs encoding/decoding without side effects. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0-0.1) are consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, purpose-specific implementation of a CESU-8 codec with no malicious intent or security concerns. It is safe, clear, and does not exhibit malicious or obfuscating behavior. The existing assessment scores are appropriate and should remain as they are.",
