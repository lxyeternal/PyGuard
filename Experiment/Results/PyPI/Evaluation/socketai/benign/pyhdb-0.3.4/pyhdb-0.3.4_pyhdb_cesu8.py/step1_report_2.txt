{
  "purpose": "Provides custom encoding and decoding for CESU-8 encoding, including incremental and stream-based handling.",
  "sources": "Reads input data during encoding, decoding, and stream processing functions.",
  "sinks": "Returns encoded/decoded data; does not write to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through encode/decode functions into custom CESU-8 transformations; registered via codecs.register.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks. Use of complex custom encoding could be used to obfuscate data, but this appears consistent with encoding logic. No evident malicious behavior or malicious network activity. No suspicious external calls or environment variable usage.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom incremental and stream encoders/decoders for CESU-8, a variant of UTF-8. It manipulates byte sequences for encoding characters outside the Basic Multilingual Plane, specifically handling codepoints above 65535 with custom byte sequences. The functions register the CESU-8 codec with Python's codecs registry. No external data transmission, file system access, or system manipulation observed. The logic is consistent with encoding/decoding purposes and does not include obfuscation, malicious commands, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a custom CESU-8 encoding scheme with proper registration in Python's codec system. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities. Its purpose is encoding transformation, and it appears safe. No malware or security risks detected based on the code content.",
