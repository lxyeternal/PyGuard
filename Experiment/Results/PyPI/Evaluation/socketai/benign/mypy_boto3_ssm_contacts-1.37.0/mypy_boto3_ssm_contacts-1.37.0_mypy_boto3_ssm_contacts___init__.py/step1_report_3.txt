{
  "purpose": "Main interface module for ssm-contacts service, providing client and paginator class imports and documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client, .paginator), and embedded docstring with usage example.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external data transmission.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; primarily imports and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected. The docstring contains a usage example, but nothing malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports specific classes from local modules and defines an export list. The embedded docstring provides usage instructions, referencing the boto3 library and various paginator classes, but contains no executable code beyond comments. No data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The code structure is typical for an SDK interface package, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as an interface layer for AWS ssm-contacts SDK with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
