{
  "purpose": "Provides an interface for the ssm-contacts service, defining imports and exposing classes and constants for client interaction and pagination.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator), standard module metadata, and documentation string.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that handle untrusted data or perform actions based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "The code primarily sets up imports and exports; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are detected. The license and documentation string are benign.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and functions from internal modules (.client and .paginator) and defines an alias and exports. It includes a detailed usage docstring with sample code. The structure is straightforward and standard for a Python SDK module, with no indications of obfuscated code or malicious logic. There are no external inputs, environment variable manipulations, or network operations performed here.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign SDK interface module for the ssm-contacts service. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this code fragment.",
