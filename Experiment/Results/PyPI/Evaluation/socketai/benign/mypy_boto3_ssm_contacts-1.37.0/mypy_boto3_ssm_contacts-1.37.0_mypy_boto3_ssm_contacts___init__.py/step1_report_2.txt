{
  "purpose": "This code provides a main interface and module exports for the ssm-contacts service client and its paginators, facilitating interaction with AWS SSM Contacts API.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external or untrusted input; it imports modules, defines constants, and initializes a client object.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in the code; no data is written to external systems, files, or network connections.",
  "flows": "The code only sets up class and function references; there are no data flows from sources to sinks, nor dynamic data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are observed. The code appears standard and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes and functions from local modules, defines a type alias, and sets up an '__all__' export list. It includes a detailed usage example as documentation but does not execute any data processing or network operations. No input handling, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials or secrets, and no malicious patterns are detected. The code's purpose is solely to expose interfaces for a service client and its paginators, consistent with normal SDK module design.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward module for exposing an AWS service client and its associated paginators. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and presents no security risks. It is safe and standard in its design.",
