  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**Code Content Summary:**\n- The code primarily consists of import statements from local modules (.client and .paginator), a type alias `Client = SSMContactsClient`, an `__all__` list for exports, and a detailed docstring with usage examples.\n- There are no data processing, network operations, input handling, or dynamic code execution.\n- The code appears to serve as an interface layer or SDK wrapper for AWS SSM Contacts, exposing classes and functions for external use.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports conclude that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious or security issues. They agree that the code is just interface setup with documentation, no data handling, no network activity, no input processing.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No logical errors or flaws are evident. The code is straightforward and well-structured.\n\n- **Scores (malware, obfuscated, security risk)?**  \n  All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, with security risk also at 0. This aligns with the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n  The code does not perform any malicious activity. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors are present.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n  The code is clear, with no obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0  \n  Given the absence of vulnerabilities, untrusted input handling, or insecure operations, the overall security risk is negligible.\n\n- **Potential Concerns:**  \n  The only potential concern could be if this code were part of a supply chain attack, but based on the content, it is a benign SDK interface module.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.  \n- The code is a standard SDK interface with no malicious or security issues.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is purely interface and documentation, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The detailed documentation and import structure suggest a standard SDK module.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll evidence points to this being a safe, standard SDK interface module with no security risks or malware concerns.",
