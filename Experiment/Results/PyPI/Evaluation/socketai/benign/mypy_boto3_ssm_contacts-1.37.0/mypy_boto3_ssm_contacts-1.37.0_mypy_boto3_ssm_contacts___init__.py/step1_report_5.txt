{
  "purpose": "To provide a main interface and import statements for the ssm-contacts service client and paginators, facilitating their use in other modules.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules and classes from local files (.client and .paginator) and defines constants.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or external data sources are processed; no sinks exist that could leak data or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing dependencies to defining the 'Client' alias and the __all__ list for module exports, with no data flow involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward module setup and documentation.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python module that imports classes and functions from local files, defines an alias for the client class, and sets up the module exports. The included documentation contains example usage but no executable code that handles input or data processing. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security issues. The structure is clean, and the imports are typical for a Python package designed to provide a wrapper around AWS SDK components.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign, well-structured interface module for the ssm-contacts service, with no evidence of malicious intent, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities.",
