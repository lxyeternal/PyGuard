{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an interface module for the ssm-contacts service, providing import statements, documentation, and export definitions for various paginator classes and the client.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external or untrusted input; it imports local modules and defines constants.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects, as the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static and only defines imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic execution are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module that imports classes from local modules, defines an alias, and exposes these via __all__. The embedded documentation provides usage examples but contains no executable or risky code. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign, standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK interface module with no security concerns or malicious behavior. All reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
