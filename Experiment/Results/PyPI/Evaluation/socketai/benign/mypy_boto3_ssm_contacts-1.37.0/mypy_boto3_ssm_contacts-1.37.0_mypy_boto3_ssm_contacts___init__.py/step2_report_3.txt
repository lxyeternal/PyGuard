  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n\nAll five reports agree that the code is a straightforward interface module for the AWS ssm-contacts SDK, primarily consisting of import statements, documentation, and export definitions. They emphasize that there are no data flows from untrusted sources, no external data handling, no network operations, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. The confidence levels are all 1, and all reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence of issues:** No issues are present. The code is purely structural, defining imports, constants, and documentation.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected; no suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** No vulnerabilities are evident, as the code does not handle untrusted input or perform risky operations.\n- **Data flows:** No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.\n- **Hardcoded secrets:** None.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **External dependencies:** Only local modules and standard SDK usage.\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The code is a typical SDK interface module, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- The documentation provides usage examples but contains no executable or risky code.\n- The import structure is standard, and the code does not process or output data in a way that could be exploited.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since there are no signs of malicious behavior, the malware score remains at 0.\n- The security risk score is appropriately 0, as the code does not perform any insecure operations.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the clear, standard code structure.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed reports and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a benign, standard SDK interface module with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Overall estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms the code's safety and benign intent.",
