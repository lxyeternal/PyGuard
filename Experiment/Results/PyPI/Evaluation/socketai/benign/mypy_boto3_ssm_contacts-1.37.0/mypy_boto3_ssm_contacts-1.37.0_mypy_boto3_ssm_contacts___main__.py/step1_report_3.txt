  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv, writes information to stdout via sys.stdout.write.",
  "sinks": "stdout via sys.stdout.write, reading from sys.argv.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--version' triggers print_version() -> outputs version info, otherwise print_info() -> outputs package details.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and only outputs static information.",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package information or version data based on command-line arguments. It imports only sys and performs no network operations, file modifications, or data processing beyond printing static strings. No untrusted input handling or external data sources are present. The structure is clear and standard, with no obfuscation or dynamic code execution. The functionality appears solely informational, with no signs of malicious intent or data leakage mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a CLI utility to display package info and version. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
