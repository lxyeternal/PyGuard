{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a command-line interface utility that outputs static package information and version details based on user input.",
  "sources": "The code reads command-line arguments via sys.argv.",
  "sinks": "The code writes output to stdout using sys.stdout.write().",
  "flows": "Input from sys.argv (specifically '--version') leads to calling print_version(), otherwise print_info() is called, both writing static strings to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward with static strings and simple argument handling.",
  "analysis": "The script imports only sys, processes command-line arguments to decide whether to print version or package info, and outputs static, hardcoded strings. It does not process untrusted input beyond argument checking, nor does it perform network activity, file operations, or dynamic code execution. The code is minimal, clear, and free of obfuscation or malicious patterns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with its static, benign nature. No vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or obfuscation are present. The code's simplicity and static output confirm its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static CLI utility that outputs package info and version details. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
