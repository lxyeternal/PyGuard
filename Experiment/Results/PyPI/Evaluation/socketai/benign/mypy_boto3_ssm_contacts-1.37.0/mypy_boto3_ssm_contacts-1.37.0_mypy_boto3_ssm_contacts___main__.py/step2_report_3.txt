  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package info or version details.\n   - No dynamic input processing, no external data sources, no network activity.\n   - No obfuscation, no suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets.\n   - All reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n   - The analysis is thorough and aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0.0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0.0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0.0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments needed; the scores are reasonable and consistent.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The highest scores are 0.0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.\n   - No justification exists for higher scores since the code is straightforward and safe.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior.\n   - Malware score of 0.0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions; they base their conclusions on code analysis.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities or hidden malicious intent.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0  \n  *The code contains no malicious activity.*\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0  \n  *No obfuscation or hidden code present.*\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0  \n  *No security risks identified.*\n\n### Summary:\nThis is a benign, straightforward CLI script with no security concerns. All evidence points to a safe utility that displays static package info and version details. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Overall Recommendation:**  \nNo further action needed. The code is safe, and the report accurately reflects that.",
