{
  "purpose": "This script serves as a command-line interface (CLI) entry point for a Python package, providing version and package info display functions.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (reads command-line arguments), sys.stdout.write (outputs to stdout)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write (outputs data), no untrusted data sources or external communications present",
  "flows": "Command-line input (from sys.argv) triggers the print_version function, which outputs version info to stdout",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys, defines functions to print package info and version, and a main function that checks for a '--version' argument. If present, it prints the version; otherwise, it prints package info. There are no external data sources, no network activity, and no code execution beyond simple print statements. The code appears to be a typical CLI script with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility that displays package information and version. No malicious or security-risk behavior is present. The code is well-structured and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity.",
