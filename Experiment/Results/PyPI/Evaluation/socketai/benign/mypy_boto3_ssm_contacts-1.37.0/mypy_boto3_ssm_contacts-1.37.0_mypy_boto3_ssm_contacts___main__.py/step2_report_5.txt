  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package information and version details. There are no indications of code that processes untrusted input beyond argument checking, no external data handling, no network activity, and no dynamic code execution. The code is straightforward and benign.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They uniformly conclude that the script is safe, with no malicious behavior or security risks. No errors or logical flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - `malware`: 0.0\n   - `obfuscated`: 0.0\n   - `securityRisk`: 0.0  \n   \n   These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since the code is purely informational, with no external dependencies, no user input processing beyond argument checking, and no network or dynamic code execution, the risk scores are correctly set to zero. A higher score would only be justified if there were signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is 0.0 across all reports, aligning with the code's behavior. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious activities.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's nature and the assessments provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0.0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0.0** — Code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score**: **0.0** — No security risks identified.\n\n**Overall**, the code is a minimal, safe CLI utility with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is benign, and the scoring reflects that. No modifications are needed.\n\n**If I were to assign my own scores based on this analysis:**\n\n- **Malware**: 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0.0  \n- **Risk**: 0.0  \n\nThis aligns with the current assessments and confirms the code's safety.",
