  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors observed. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI script that provides package info and version information. It reads command-line arguments and writes static text to stdout. No untrusted input is processed beyond argument check, and the outputs are fixed strings. No external network calls, data leaks, or malicious actions are present. The script is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a straightforward CLI utility for displaying package info. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
