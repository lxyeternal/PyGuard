  "purpose": "Provide CLI interface for displaying package information and version details.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout.write for output messages.",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write outputs data; no untrusted data is processed or sent elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Input from sys.argv affects which print function is called; output is written to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. Functions perform straightforward printing tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys for handling command-line arguments and output. It defines two functions, print_info() and print_version(), which output static package information and version info respectively. The main() function checks for '--version' in sys.argv and accordingly prints the version or package info. The script runs main() if executed directly. There are no external data sources, no user input processing beyond argument check, and no network activity or data leakage mechanisms present. The code appears to be a simple CLI utility with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI script that displays static package information and version details. It contains no malicious behavior, no external data handling, and no security risks. Overall, it is safe and straightforward.",
