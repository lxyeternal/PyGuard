  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The script is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static package info or version based on command-line arguments.\n- It imports only `sys`.\n- It handles `--version` argument to print version; otherwise, it prints package info.\n- No external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- No secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Confirm if issues are present\n- The code appears benign; all reports agree on its straightforward, static nature.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or vulnerabilities.\n- No dynamic or obfuscated code.\n- No external data sources or untrusted input beyond argument check, which is safe.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- They correctly identify the code as benign, straightforward, and safe.\n- No logical flaws or misconceptions are evident.\n- They assign malware and obfuscation scores as 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Note:** The reports' confidence scores are all 1, which is justified given the simplicity.\n\n### Step 3: Review scores assigned\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n- These are appropriate, given the static, non-malicious nature of the code.\n- The overall risk scores are also 0, consistent with the findings.\n\n**Suggestion:** No changes needed; the scores are reasonable.\n\n### Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5\n- The highest scores are 0, indicating no risk.\n- If any score were above 0.5, justification would be necessary, but here, all are 0.\n\n### Step 5: Malware score considerations\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n- Scores of 0 are appropriate.\n\n### Step 6: Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities\n- The reports assume the code is purely informational and safe.\n- No assumptions are unjustified; the code is straightforward.\n- No hidden or suspicious behavior.\n\n### Step 7: Consistency of scores\n- The scores are consistent across reports and with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a simple, benign CLI utility with no security issues, malware, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate and appropriately score the code as safe.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0  \n\nThe code is entirely safe, with no indicators of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate. The code is safe, straightforward, and poses no security risks. No changes to scores or conclusions are necessary.",
