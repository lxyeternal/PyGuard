  "purpose": "Define type literals for AWS SSM contacts service and related constants for type checking.",
  "sources": "Static definitions of string literals assigned to type aliases; no external input or data reads.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; no handling of untrusted data or external systems.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input to sensitive operations; all data is statically defined.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual code structures observed. The code contains only type definitions and conditional imports.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides string literal type definitions for AWS service constants and configures compatibility for different Python versions. It includes conditional import for 'Literal' based on Python version and defines many constants as Literal types for type hinting. No input, output, or executable logic that could be malicious is present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code is straightforward and purely declarative.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static type definitions module intended for type checking support, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
