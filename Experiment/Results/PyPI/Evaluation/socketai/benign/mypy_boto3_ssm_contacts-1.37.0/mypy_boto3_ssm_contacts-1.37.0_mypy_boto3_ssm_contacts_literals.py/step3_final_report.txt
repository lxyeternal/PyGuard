  "purpose": "Static type alias definitions for AWS service names, resource identifiers, pagination tokens, and regions to facilitate type checking with mypy in boto3-based code.",
  "sources": "Constant string literals assigned to type aliases, imported conditionally based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No runtime data input/output, no external data sources, no untrusted data flows.",
  "flows": "N/A – purely static declarations with no data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; straightforward static type definitions with no obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static type alias definitions using Literal for AWS services, regions, pagination, and contact-related constants. It includes a version check for importing Literal, ensuring compatibility. There are no dynamic data flows, external inputs, secrets, or executable logic. The purpose is solely for static type annotations to improve code safety and developer experience. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static type definitions module intended for type checking support in boto3 SDK stubs. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security concerns. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's static, declarative nature.",
