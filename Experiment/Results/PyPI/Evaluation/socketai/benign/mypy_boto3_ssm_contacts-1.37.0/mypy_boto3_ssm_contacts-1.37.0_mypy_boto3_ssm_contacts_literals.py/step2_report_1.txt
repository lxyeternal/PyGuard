  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the reports:**\n\n- All five reports describe the code as static type definitions using string literals for AWS service names, resource names, pagination identifiers, regions, and specific contact-related constants.\n- They emphasize that the code is purely declarative, with no dynamic data processing, input/output, or external interactions.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are detected.\n- The purpose across all reports is to facilitate static type checking with mypy, ensuring type safety in codebases that use boto3.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code correctness:** The code correctly defines type aliases with `Literal` for various AWS-related constants, with conditional import for compatibility.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; code is straightforward.\n- **Security risks:** None apparent; static definitions pose no security threat.\n\n### Scores assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent and appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0, which is justified given the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n### Logical flaws or errors:\n- The reports are accurate in their assessment; no logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n- The purpose and analysis are consistent with the code's static, declarative nature.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores are reasonable and aligned with the code's characteristics.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThis code is a benign, static type definitions module used for type checking support, with no security or malicious concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary conclusion:**  \n**The code is safe, non-malicious, and purely for static type annotations.** The reports correctly identify this, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No further action or adjustment is necessary.",
