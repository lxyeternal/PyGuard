  "purpose": "Define type literals for boto3 ssm-contacts service and related AWS service identifiers for static type checking.",
  "sources": "Static data definitions, import statements for typing and sys module, version check for conditional import of Literal.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input, external data processing, or external outputs observed.",
  "flows": "N/A – purely static definitions; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. Code is straightforward, defining type literals for static type annotations. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports system version info to conditionally import the Literal type, ensuring compatibility with Python versions >= 3.12. It then defines multiple Literal types for various AWS-related identifiers, such as service names, region names, paginator names, and specific string literals for AWS contact and service types. The purpose appears to be for type annotations and static analysis. The code is purely declarative with no executable or malicious components.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of type definitions intended for static type checking with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain any suspicious behavior or malicious payloads.",
