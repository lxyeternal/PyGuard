  "purpose": "Define string literal types for AWS service and resource names used in boto3 ssm-contacts related operations and pagination.",
  "sources": "Static type alias definitions for literals, imported modules (`sys`, `typing`, `typing_extensions`).",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only declares constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior detected. The code is straightforward and consists solely of type definitions and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules conditionally based on Python version, then declares numerous string literal types for AWS services, resource names, pagination, and regions, used for type annotations. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, and no hardcoded secrets or credentials. It is purely type alias declarations intended for static type checking. No signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module defining type aliases for AWS SDK related literals, used for type safety in a larger codebase. There are no malicious behaviors, security risks, or anomalies detected.",
