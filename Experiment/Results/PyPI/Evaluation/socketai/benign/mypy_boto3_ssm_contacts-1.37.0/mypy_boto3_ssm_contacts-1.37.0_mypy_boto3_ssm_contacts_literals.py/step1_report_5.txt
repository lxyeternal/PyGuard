  "purpose": "Define type literals for AWS SDK service and resource names, and pagination identifiers for use with mypy static type checking.",
  "sources": "Constants defining string literals for various AWS services, resource types, pagination names, regions, and other identifiers.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that could lead to data leakage or malicious actions; no input/output handling or external data sources.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only declares static type literals.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code consists solely of static literal definitions with no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for AWS service names, resource types, and pagination names using Python's Literal type, conditional importing for compatibility, and module exports. There is no code that performs data processing, input/output, or external communications. It does not include any obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hidden behaviors. The purpose is purely to facilitate static type checking with mypy. Overall, the code is straightforward, well-structured, and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of type literal definitions intended for static type checking. No malicious behavior or security risks are present. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious code segments.",
