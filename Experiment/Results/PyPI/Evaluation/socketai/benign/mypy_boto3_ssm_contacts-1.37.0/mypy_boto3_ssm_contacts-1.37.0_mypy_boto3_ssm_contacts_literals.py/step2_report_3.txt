  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, potential security implications, and scoring consistency.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is static, defining string literal types for AWS services, resources, regions, and related constants.\n- It uses conditional imports to maintain compatibility across Python versions.\n- There are no dynamic data flows, external inputs, or outputs.\n- No secrets, credentials, or sensitive data are present.\n- No obfuscation, code execution, or suspicious behaviors are detected.\n- The purpose is purely for static type checking, aiding in type annotations and validation.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed review of each report:**\n\n#### **Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Defines type literals for AWS service, paginator, region, and resource names.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Completely benign, static definitions with no malicious or security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Type literals for AWS SSM contacts service and related constants.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Static, straightforward, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Type literals for boto3 ssm-contacts service and AWS identifiers.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Static definitions, compatibility handling, no executable logic.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** String literal types for AWS services, pagination, regions.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Static, no dynamic code or external data, purely for type annotations.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Type literals for AWS SDK service/resource names, pagination.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Static, no suspicious behavior, safe for static type checking.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign `0`. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports are clear, straightforward static definitions, so `0` is correct.\n- **Risk score:** Since these are static type definitions with no runtime behavior, a `0` is justified for security risk.\n\n**Potential for higher scores:**  \n- Only if there were dynamic code, obfuscation, or embedded malicious payloads. None are present here.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\n\nThis code is a benign, static type definition module intended to support type checking in AWS SDK stubs. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n\n| Metric             | Score |\n|--------------------|--------|\n| Malware            | 0      |\n| Obfuscated         | 0      |\n| Security Risk      | 0      |\n\n**Note:** The current report scores are consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Would you like a detailed justification for these scores or any further analysis?**",
