{
  "purpose": "Defines type literals for various AWS service, paginator, region, and resource names used in boto3 stubs for type checking and validation.",
  "sources": "Static definitions of string literals assigned to type aliases, and a conditional import of 'Literal' based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No dynamic data inputs, external data, or untrusted sources; no data flow or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "The code does not process data flows or untrusted data. It only establishes type aliases and constants.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a straightforward set of type alias definitions for static type checking. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code structures are present. No obfuscation, dynamic execution, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines string literal types for various AWS service and resource names, with conditional import to ensure compatibility across Python versions. No runtime code or data processing occurs. It includes a copyright statement and documentation, but no external or untrusted data handling. No potential malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system harm are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, static type definition module used for type checking in boto3 AWS SDK stubs. It does not contain malware, malicious behaviors, or security risks. It simply provides constants for type annotations, with no indication of any malicious intent.",
