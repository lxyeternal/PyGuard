  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clarifies that the code is for type annotations and class structure, with no executable logic.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Focuses on method signatures, no data processing or external interactions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The code is purely interface and type hints.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Fully benign, high confidence (1.0), malware and obfuscated scores at 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that this is a safe, type-annotated SDK interface with no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above, emphasizing type annotations, exception handling, and method signatures.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Notes potential URL generation in `generate_presigned_url`, but this is standard for SDKs.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior; URLs are for resource access, typical in SDKs.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Also benign, with a very high confidence (0.95). The security risk is minimal (0.1), which is acceptable given the context.\n\n**Assessment:** Correctly states that the code is a standard SDK wrapper with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines a client interface with documentation, no logic.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or external network activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Purely declarative, no executable code, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Fully benign, high confidence (1.0), malware score at 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriately classifies this as a safe SDK interface.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focused on type annotations and method signatures.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No runtime logic or external data flows.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, standard SDK stub with high confidence (1.0), malware at 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correctly identified as benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to others, type annotations, method signatures, no logic.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Clearly benign, high confidence (1.0), malware at 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Properly classifies this as a safe SDK interface.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of all reports:\n- **Code presence:** All reports agree that this is a type-annotated SDK interface, with no executable logic, malicious code, or obfuscation.\n- **Malware scores:** All at 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All at 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low, as expected for interface/stub code.\n\n### Final expert assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (clear, non-obfuscated code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Overall conclusion:** This code is a standard, well-structured, type-annotated SDK interface for AWS SSM Contacts. It contains no malicious logic, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The high confidence scores across reports are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus of the reports.",
