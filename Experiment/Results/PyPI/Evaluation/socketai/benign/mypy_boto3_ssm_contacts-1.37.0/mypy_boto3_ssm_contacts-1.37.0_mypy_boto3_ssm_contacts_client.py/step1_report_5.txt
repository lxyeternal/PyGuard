{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface definitions for the AWS SSM Contacts service, providing typed method signatures for SDK interactions.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and internal modules; constant string definitions; class and method definitions.",
  "sinks": "Method parameters with **kwargs unpacked into request type definitions; no direct sinks for untrusted data or external output flows.",
  "flows": "Method calls pass **kwargs to SDK functions, typically request payloads; no data flows outside the SDK context; no external network or data exfiltration present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated logic. The code appears as standard SDK client interface with type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily composed of type definitions, class interface for the boto3 client, and method signatures with documentation links. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or malicious logic observed. The class design follows standard patterns for SDK typing, with overloads for paginators. No signs of suspicious behavior such as hardcoded credentials or data leaks. The code is well-structured for type safety and SDK usage, consistent with an open-source SDK stub package.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard type annotation and interface definition for the AWS SSM Contacts SDK, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical SDK stub module, focused on providing type hints and method signatures for safe use.",
