  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious behavior, logical consistency, and the appropriateness of the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes type annotations and class definitions for the AWS SSM Contacts client. No code execution or suspicious logic.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Method signatures accept kwargs, return typed responses. No actual data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is purely interface and type annotation definitions, consistent with SDK design. No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0.0, Obfuscated: 0.0, Risk: 0.0 — **Reasonable.**\n\n**Verdict:** Fully benign, well-structured SDK interface. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, providing type annotations and method signatures for AWS SDK.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Methods return dictionaries or typed objects; generate_presigned_url can produce URLs with embedded parameters.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, no code injection, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard SDK wrapper, no malicious intent. The generate_presigned_url method could be misused if URL parameters are manipulated, but in this context, it’s standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0.0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 — **Slightly above zero risk but still negligible.**\n\n**Verdict:** No malicious behavior; the small risk score is reasonable given the URL generation capability, but overall safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Interface definitions, no executable logic.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Purely declarative; no data processing or external interactions.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard SDK interface with no malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0.0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.0 — **Appropriate.**\n\n**Verdict:** Completely benign, safe SDK interface.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type annotations and SDK interface.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No actual logic, only method signatures and documentation.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical SDK stub for static analysis; no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0.0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.0 — **Appropriate.**\n\n**Verdict:** Safe, standard SDK interface.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type annotations, method signatures, no runtime logic.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing, only method signatures.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Consistent with SDK stub modules, purely declarative.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0.0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.0 — **Appropriate.**\n\n**Verdict:** Completely benign.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports are 0.0, which is correct given the nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, mostly 0.0 or 0.1, which is reasonable considering the code is just type annotations and interface definitions.\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\nThe code in all reports is a standard, well-structured SDK stub providing type annotations, method signatures, and documentation links for the AWS SSM Contacts client. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.0 to 0.1 (negligible, mostly due to URL generation capability, but standard in SDKs)\n\n**Final note:** The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's nature. No adjustments are necessary.",
