  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for the AWS SSM Contacts service, facilitating type-safe interaction with the API.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local modules; class method definitions and property declarations; overloads for paginator creation.",
  "sinks": "Method implementations that accept arbitrary keyword arguments unpacked into specific request type definitions, and methods returning typed responses.",
  "flows": "Method calls with kwargs unpacked from type defs (sources) to API call simulations (sinks), mainly through method signatures and overloads.",
  "anomalies": "No actual code execution, command execution, network operations, or suspicious logic present. The code is primarily type hints, class structure, and documentation links.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations and a class structure for the boto3 SSM Contacts client. It includes property and method signatures, overloads for paginators, and exception class definitions. There are no implementations executing malicious behavior or including obfuscated code. The use of flexible **kwargs with type unpacking is standard for dynamic API clients. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious data leaks are evident. The code is consistent with standard SDK interface definition, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a type annotation and interface definition for the SSM Contacts client, with no indications of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. It appears to be a safe, type-safe wrapper for AWS SDK interaction, primarily for static analysis and autocompletion purposes.",
