  "purpose": "Type annotations and interface definitions for the boto3 SSM Contacts client, enabling type checking and IDE support for AWS SDK interactions.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local modules; class and method definitions; type annotations; property and method signatures; docstrings.",
  "sinks": "Method implementations, property accessors, and type definitions that interact with external AWS services via boto3, primarily through method signatures and documentation links.",
  "flows": "No actual data flow or execution logic present; the code mainly provides interface definitions and type annotations. No untrusted data processing or external data handling occurs within this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is largely declarative, focusing on type hints and method signatures. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are observed. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up a typed interface for the boto3 SSM Contacts client, including method signatures, property accessors, and exception classes. It imports standard libraries and third-party typing extensions, with no logic execution or data processing. All docstrings point to AWS documentation, and no suspicious behavior or malicious patterns are detectable. The focus is on type safety and API documentation, not on runtime logic or external data handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, type-annotated interface definition for the boto3 SSM Contacts client, intended for static type checking and IDE support. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks within this fragment.",
