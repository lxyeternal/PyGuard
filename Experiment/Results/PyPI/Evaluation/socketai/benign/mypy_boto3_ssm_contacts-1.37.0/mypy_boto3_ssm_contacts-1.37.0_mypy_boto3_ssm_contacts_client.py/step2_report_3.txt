  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes type annotations and class structure; no executable code.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Purely type signatures, no data processing or network activity.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious logic. The code is a standard SDK interface with documentation links.  \n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard SDK interface, no malware, obfuscation, or security risk.  \n- **Scores:** malware 0.0, obfuscated 0.0, risk 0.0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, with detailed method signatures and documentation.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data handling or network operations; only interface signatures.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior; the generate_presigned_url could be used to generate resource URLs, but in this context, it’s standard.  \n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate SDK interface, no malicious activity, safe.  \n- **Scores:** malware 0.0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.1 — the slight risk could be due to presigned URLs, but overall negligible.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar interface definitions, no executable logic.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks, no dynamic code, no external connections.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Purely declarative, no malicious patterns.  \n- **Conclusion:** Benign SDK interface, safe, no security risks.  \n- **Scores:** malware 0.0, obfuscated 0.0, risk 0.0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type annotations, method signatures, documentation links.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No runtime logic, no external data processing.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code or obfuscation.  \n- **Conclusion:** Standard SDK stub, safe, no security concerns.  \n- **Scores:** malware 0.0, obfuscated 0.0, risk 0.0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar pattern—type annotations, method signatures, documentation.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks, no dynamic code, no network activity.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no malicious intent.  \n- **Conclusion:** Typical SDK stub, safe, no security issues.  \n- **Scores:** malware 0.0, obfuscated 0.0, risk 0.0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0.0. No malicious behavior detected—no code injection, backdoors, or suspicious network activity.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0.0, as the code is straightforward type annotations and interface definitions, not obfuscated or minified code.  \n- **Risk Score:** All are very low (0.0 or 0.1). The slight risk in report 2 from generate_presigned_url is acceptable, given the context.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is purely declarative, consisting of class definitions, method signatures, and type annotations.  \n- No executable logic, no data processing, no network operations, and no embedded secrets or obfuscation.  \n- The documentation links and usage examples are standard and do not suggest malicious intent.  \n- The presence of overloads and detailed type definitions is typical for SDK type stub packages.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n**The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.**  \n- **Malware:** 0.0 (no malicious behavior)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 (not obfuscated)  \n- **Risk:** 0.0–0.1 (negligible, mainly due to presigned URL capability, which is standard)\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0  \n- **Risk:** 0.0–0.1\n\nThis code is a safe, well-structured SDK interface with no security risks or malicious intent.",
