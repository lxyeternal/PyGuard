  "purpose": "Type annotations and class definitions for the AWS SSM Contacts client SDK interface, providing method signatures, documentation links, and exception handling structures.",
  "sources": "Method signatures accepting kwargs unpacked into request type definitions, documentation links, and class properties.",
  "sinks": "No data leaks, network activity, or external data handling; purely interface signatures.",
  "flows": "Method calls with kwargs leading to response types; no runtime data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, obfuscated patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type annotations, method signatures, and documentation references for a client SDK. No runtime logic, data processing, or network activity is present. The generate_presigned_url method is standard for SDKs and does not indicate malicious intent. Overloads for paginators are typical for SDK stub modules. The code is declarative, serving as a static interface, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, well-structured SDK interface stub for AWS SSM Contacts, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities detected. The scores are consistent with its nature, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low risk score (~0.0-0.1) primarily due to URL generation capabilities inherent in SDKs.",
