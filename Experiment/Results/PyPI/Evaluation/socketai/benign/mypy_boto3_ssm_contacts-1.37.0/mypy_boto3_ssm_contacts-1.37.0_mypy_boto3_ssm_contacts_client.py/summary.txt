  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, well-structured SDK interface stub for AWS SSM Contacts, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities detected. The scores are consistent with its nature, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low risk score (~0.0-0.1) primarily due to URL generation capabilities inherent in SDKs."
