{
  "purpose": "This code defines type annotations and data structures for the ssm-contacts service in Python, facilitating type-safe interactions with the service's API.",
  "sources": "The code reads static type definitions, type annotations, imported literals, and Python standard library modules for version-dependent compatibility. It does not process external input or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain sinks that process untrusted data; it mainly defines data structures and type annotations for internal use.",
  "flows": "There are no runtime data flows involving untrusted input, as the code primarily sets static type definitions without dynamic data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code uses version checks for compatibility and defines data structures using TypedDict, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of type definitions for a Python SDK interacting with AWS SSM Contacts. It uses conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions, leverages TypedDict for structured data, and includes annotations for various API request and response types. No runtime logic, input processing, or dynamic behavior is present. All patterns are typical for SDK type definition modules and do not exhibit malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured set of type definitions and does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is purely for type safety and documentation purposes.",
