  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, the appropriateness of their scores, and whether any concerns about malware, obfuscation, or security risks are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states that the code is a collection of type definitions, constants, and conditional imports for compatibility, with no runtime logic or malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The code is purely declarative, defining TypedDicts, constants, and version-dependent imports. No dynamic code, no data processing, no network calls, or secrets.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — **appropriate**.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's reasoning is sound; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the static nature of the code, no untrusted data processing, and standard practices.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; the code only defines data structures and type annotations.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — **appropriate**.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, highlights the static, declarative nature, with no malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; no code execution, no external interactions, just type definitions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — **appropriate**.\n- **Conclusion:** Well justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the lack of dynamic behavior, input handling, or external data flows.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — **appropriate**.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Consistent with previous assessments; no executable logic, no external data handling, purely static type annotations.\n- **Assessment:** No concerns; the code is a schema for type checking.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — **appropriate**.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** No, all reports correctly identify that the code is purely declarative type annotations and data structures.\n- **Malware or Obfuscation:** No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- **Security Risks:** None apparent; the code is static and for type safety.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and risk scores as 0, which is justified.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code does not process untrusted data, execute code dynamically, or interact with external systems in a way that could be malicious.\n- The conditional imports are standard for maintaining compatibility across Python versions.\n- The content is solely type annotations and data schemas, typical for SDKs or API clients.\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. There are no security concerns with this code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is a well-structured, static set of type definitions for an SDK or API client. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
