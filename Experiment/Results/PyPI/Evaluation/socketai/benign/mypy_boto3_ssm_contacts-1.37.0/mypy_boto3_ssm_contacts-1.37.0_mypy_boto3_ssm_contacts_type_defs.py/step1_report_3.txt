  "purpose": "Type definitions for the ssm-contacts service API, facilitating type-safe interactions with the AWS SSM Contacts service.",
  "sources": "Reading static type annotations and constants imported from other modules, including sys, datetime, and various type definition modules.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; the code does not process untrusted input or produce outputs that could be exploited. It primarily defines types and data structures.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data. The code solely provides static type annotations and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior. Use of conditional imports based on sys.version_info is standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of TypedDict and type annotations for a specific AWS service. It imports and defines various data structures, including optional fields, constants, and version-dependent imports. There is no dynamic code execution, no input handling, nor any network or system manipulation. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified within this code segment. The primary function is to serve as a type stub for static type checking.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured set of type definitions for the AWS ssm-contacts service, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is purely declarative, facilitating type safety for client code. No vulnerabilities or malware are present.",
