  "purpose": "Type definitions for ssm-contacts service API, primarily used for type checking and validation.",
  "sources": "Static type annotations and data structure definitions; no data input/output handling, no network or environment variable reading.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data processing or external data flows.",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs. Usage of conditional imports based on Python version appears standard. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or misleading variables.",
  "analysis": "The code provides TypedDict definitions and type annotations for various request/response structures in a Python AWS SDK-like library. It uses conditional imports to handle compatibility across Python versions. No code execution, input handling, or network interactions are present. The code appears solely as static type annotations and data schemas for a SDK, with no signs of malicious logic or harmful behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for defining data types and structures related to the ssm-contacts service. It contains no executable logic, data handling, or external interactions that could be malicious. Therefore, it poses no security threat or malicious intent based on the provided content.",
