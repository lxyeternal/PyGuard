  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to identify any inconsistencies, errors, or security concerns.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The report states that the code is purely declarative, defining type annotations and data structures for the ssm-contacts API. It emphasizes the absence of runtime logic, network operations, or data handling that could be malicious.\n- **Assessment:** The code is indeed a comprehensive set of TypedDict classes and constants, with conditional imports for compatibility. No dynamic code, no data processing, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's conclusion that the code is safe and purely declarative is accurate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it highlights that the code only defines data schemas and type annotations, with no processing of untrusted data or executable logic.\n- **Assessment:** The code consists of static type definitions, conditional imports, and constants. No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0, consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly identified as safe.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Reinforces that the code is a set of type definitions for AWS SDK, with no runtime logic or external data handling.\n- **Assessment:** The code is purely static, with no dynamic or executable parts.\n- **Malware score:** 0, appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent or security risk.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code is for static type checking, with no input processing or external interactions.\n- **Assessment:** All patterns are typical for SDK type definitions.\n- **Malware score:** 0, fitting.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same as others, emphasizing the static, schema-like nature of the code.\n- **Assessment:** No executable or dynamic code.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** No security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- **Code presence:** All reports agree that the code is purely declarative, consisting of type annotations, TypedDict classes, constants, and conditional imports for compatibility.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected or suggested.\n- **Obfuscation:** Not present.\n- **Security risk:** None.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscation observed.\n- **Risk score:** 0, as the code is purely static type definitions with no runtime or external interactions.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The use of conditional imports based on Python version is standard practice.\n- No secrets, no dynamic code, no external data processing.\n- The code's purpose is to facilitate static type checking and documentation, not runtime behavior.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, well-structured, and free of malicious intent. The provided scores and summaries are appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus across all reports.",
