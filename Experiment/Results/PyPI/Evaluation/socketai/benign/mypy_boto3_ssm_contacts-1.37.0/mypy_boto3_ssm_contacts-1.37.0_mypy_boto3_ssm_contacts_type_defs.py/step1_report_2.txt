{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations for ssm-contacts service data structures for type safety and clarity in Python code.",
  "sources": "Import statements, type definitions, and data structure declarations, especially the use of input data in function signatures and variable annotations.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; the code primarily defines data types and schemas without processing external input directly.",
  "flows": "No executable data flow or data processing logic; only type definitions and data structure schemas are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hard-coded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed. Usage of conditional imports based on Python version is standard practice. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type annotations, data structure definitions via TypedDict, and conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. It does not include any logic that processes untrusted data or interacts with external systems in a way that could be malicious. The inclusion of the copyright notice and documentation link appears standard. Overall, the code serves as a schema or type hints module without executable or network interaction code.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard type annotation and data schema definition for a Python SDK or library. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The structure and content indicate purely declarative code aimed at type safety.",
