  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to verify the claims and scores, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes extensive type definitions for the ssm-contacts API, imported constants, and compatibility imports.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No runtime logic, no data flow involving untrusted input, no obfuscation or malicious patterns. It’s purely declarative, serving as type annotations.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95 — high, given the static nature.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing type safety and data schemas.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No evidence of malicious code or dynamic behavior. Standard use of TypedDict and conditional imports.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0 — very high.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focused on static type definitions for AWS SDK.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No runtime or untrusted data processing; purely declarative. No obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — high.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar static type definitions, version-dependent imports.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No dynamic or malicious behavior; just static data schemas.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95 — high.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type definitions for API, no data handling.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No runtime logic, no untrusted data processing, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — very high.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports. The code is purely static type definitions with no executable or network code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or code hiding techniques.\n- **Risk score:** 0. Since the code is only type annotations and data schemas, it does not pose any security risk.\n\n### Final justification:\n- All reports correctly identify that this code is a set of static type definitions for an SDK or API client.\n- There are no signs of malicious behavior, dynamic code execution, or data handling that could introduce security risks.\n- The use of conditional imports for compatibility is standard and does not indicate obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe, well-structured, and purely declarative.\n- The scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, risk) are appropriate and should remain at 0.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**My estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
