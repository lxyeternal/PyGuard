  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to verify the claims, check for inconsistencies, and determine the appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Declares type annotations for the ssm-contacts API, with no untrusted data flow.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No runtime logic, no obfuscation, no suspicious patterns. Usage of conditional imports is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, well-structured, purely declarative.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion that the code is safe and purely for static type definitions is accurate. The malware score of 0 aligns. The risk score of 0 is appropriate given no executable or malicious code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines type annotations for data structures, no processing of untrusted input.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, no dynamic code, no secrets.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is a standard type annotations module.\n\n**Assessment:** The conclusion is consistent with the code content. Malware score remains 0. Risk score 0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type annotations for AWS SDK, no untrusted data handling.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No dynamic code, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Purely declarative, safe.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion is justified. Malware score 0, risk score 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type definitions for SDK, no external data processing.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, no secrets, standard version-dependent imports.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious behavior, purely static type info.\n\n**Assessment:** The conclusion is consistent. Malware score 0, risk score 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type annotations for the AWS SDK, no untrusted data handling.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No runtime logic, no obfuscation, no secrets.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Purely type definitions, safe.\n\n**Assessment:** The conclusion is justified. Malware score 0, risk score 0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, all reports correctly identify that this is purely static type annotation code.\n- **Malware potential:** None detected; the code is declarative and static.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Risk score:** All are appropriately 0, as there's no executable, network, or data processing logic that could pose a security threat.\n- **Scores consistency:** The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Final Justification:\nGiven the detailed review, the code is a set of static type definitions for an SDK, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The reported scores are appropriate, and there is no need to adjust them.\n\n---\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is safe, purely declarative, and intended for static type checking.",
