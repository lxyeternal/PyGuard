{
  "purpose": "Static type definitions and data schemas for the AWS SSM Contacts SDK, facilitating type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Type annotations, TypedDict classes, constants, and version-dependent imports; no runtime or data processing code.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, no external data flow, no execution, no network activity.",
  "flows": "None; purely declarative type definitions without data flow or execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "None; standard static type definitions with conditional imports for compatibility, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type annotations, TypedDict classes, constants, and conditional imports for Python version compatibility. It does not process untrusted input, execute code dynamically, or perform network operations. The structure is straightforward, well-organized, and adheres to standard practices for type safety in Python SDKs. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured set of static type definitions for the AWS SDK, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, all appropriate given the static, declarative nature of the code.",
