  "purpose": "Define type annotations and data structures for the ssm-contacts service API.",
  "sources": "Constant imports, type annotations, class and variable definitions, type aliases, and imports from external modules such as sys, datetime, typing, and typing_extensions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data flows involving untrusted input; the code primarily declares type structures and constants.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow or untrusted data processing observed; the code consists mainly of static type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns identified. Usage of version-dependent conditional imports is standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code provides extensive TypedDict class definitions and type aliases for structured data used in an API client. It includes conditional imports based on Python version to ensure compatibility, which is standard practice. No code execution, network operations, or data handling logic is present that could be malicious. The code does not contain obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns. It is purely declarative type annotations and data structures for API modeling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a safe, well-structured set of type definitions for a Python SDK or API client. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are evident. It mainly facilitates static type checking and documentation purposes.",
