{
  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging the mypy-boto3-ssm-contacts module, defining metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file for long description; static string literals for metadata; imports from pathlib and setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external network interactions; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow; static data used throughout; no external command execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and adheres to standard packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with static imports, file reading, and fixed metadata. It does not process user input, execute external commands, or contain obfuscated or malicious code. All data is hardcoded or file-based, with no dynamic or untrusted sources. Dependencies are explicitly specified with conditional requirements. The structure and content are consistent with safe, standard package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard Python package setup configuration with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores—malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0—are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
