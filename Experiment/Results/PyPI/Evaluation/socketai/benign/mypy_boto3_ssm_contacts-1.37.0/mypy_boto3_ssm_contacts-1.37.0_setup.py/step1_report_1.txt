{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package named 'mypy-boto3-ssm-contacts', intended to define package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; static import statements; string literals defining package metadata and URLs.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external command execution present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only defines package setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets; standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'Path' from pathlib and 'setup' from setuptools, then reads a local README.md file for the long description. The setup() function is called with static package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. There are no dynamic or user-controlled inputs, no code execution, no network activity, and no handling of untrusted data. The script appears to be a standard, well-formed setup configuration for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It solely defines package metadata for distribution purposes.",
