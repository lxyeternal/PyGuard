  "purpose": "Setup script for the mypy-boto3-ssm-contacts package, used for package installation and metadata definition.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; imports from standard library and setuptools; no untrusted input sources present.",
  "sinks": "None; the script primarily defines package metadata and dependencies without any data output or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the script does not process untrusted input or execute external commands based on user data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code is straightforward, standard setup script with no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, reads a markdown file for long description, and calls setup() with static package metadata. No external data is processed at runtime, and no code injection or malicious logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate for its intended purpose.",
