{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package named 'mypy-boto3-ssm-contacts' with specified metadata, dependencies, and package data for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long_description; imports from pathlib and setuptools; reads environment variables implicitly via Python standard libraries; uses hardcoded strings for package configuration.",
  "sinks": "The setup function uses hardcoded strings for package information and dependencies, which are not security-sensitive; no external data is processed or stored.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the hardcoded strings and file read (README.md) into the setup function parameters, with no untrusted input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs, such as dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden behavior. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or potential backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python module. It reads a README file for long description, defines package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and URLs. All strings are static and intended for package configuration. There are no indications of malicious activity, data leakage, or suspicious behaviors. No external or untrusted input is processed, and no code executes outside of standard package setup procedures.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign, conventional Python setup file for distributing a package. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks in this code.",
