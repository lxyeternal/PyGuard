{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the Python package 'mypy-boto3-ssm-contacts', used for package configuration and installation.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; imports setup from setuptools; reads environment variables indirectly via package requirements; no direct input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external actions; package configuration does not invoke external commands or handle untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; package data is statically defined, and dependencies are specified with conditions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; standard setup script with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Python package setup configuration using setuptools. It reads the README.md for the long description and specifies package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no dynamic code execution, and no network activity or sensitive data handling. The only dynamic aspect is the conditional dependency based on Python version, which is standard and safe. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal, benign setup script with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves solely to package and distribute a Python module without executing any untrusted code or performing unsafe operations.",
