  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the script as a package setup configuration reading a local README.md.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately notes that the script is static, with no untrusted data, code execution, or network activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent with the analysis.\n- **Justification:** No issues detected; the setup script is standard and safe.\n\n**Assessment:** No problems. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, accurate.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states that no untrusted data or suspicious behavior is present.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues. Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the script as a package configuration.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately notes the static nature, absence of dynamic code, and external interactions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n- **Justification:** No malicious intent or security concerns.\n\n**Assessment:** No problems; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states the script is standard, with no untrusted input or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — justified.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious activity detected.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately identifies the script as a benign setup configuration.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Assessment:** No problems; scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward setup script with no dynamic or malicious components.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports assign zero scores, which is appropriate given the static, well-formed nature of the code.\n- **Security Risk:** All reports correctly rate zero, as there are no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent. The setup script is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.",
