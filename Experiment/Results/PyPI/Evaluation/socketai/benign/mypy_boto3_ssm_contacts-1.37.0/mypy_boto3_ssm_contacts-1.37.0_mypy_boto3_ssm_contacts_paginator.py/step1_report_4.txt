{
  "purpose": "Define paginators for the ssm-contacts service client using boto3 with type annotations.",
  "sources": "Imports of system modules, type definitions from '.type_defs', and the class methods including 'paginate' which accept various keyword arguments.",
  "sinks": "The 'paginate' methods invoke the base Paginator with unpacked keyword arguments; no direct data sinks or data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input data from 'kwargs' flows into 'paginate' method, which calls the base class 'Paginator' with 'Unpack' of specific request types; no suspicious external data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activities. The code consists of standard paginator class definitions with type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a set of class definitions for paginators, extending a generic 'Paginator' with specific type annotations. It conditionally imports 'Unpack' based on Python version. Each paginator class provides a 'paginate' method that unpacks specific request type definitions and returns an iterator over result types. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or secret handling is present. The imports and class structures are consistent with standard boto3 stub implementations, and no suspicious or malicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of boto3 paginator stubs with no malicious intent. It purely provides type-safe wrappers around boto3's pagination features for the ssm-contacts service. No malicious or sabotage behavior is detected.",
