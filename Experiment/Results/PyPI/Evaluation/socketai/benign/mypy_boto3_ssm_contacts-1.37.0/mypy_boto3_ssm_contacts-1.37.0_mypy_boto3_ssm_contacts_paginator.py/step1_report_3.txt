  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for ssm-contacts service client to facilitate pagination in boto3.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs; class methods that call self.paginate with kwargs.",
  "sinks": "The paginate methods accept **kwargs with specific type definitions, then call self.paginate, returning PageIterator.",
  "flows": "Input kwargs -> paginate method -> self.paginate -> PageIterator, no data transformation or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code constructs. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward type annotation and class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines paginator classes inheriting from botocore.paginator.Paginator, with type annotations for request and result types. It includes conditional import logic for Unpack depending on Python version. No code performs data processing, network, file I/O, or system commands. No malicious behavior is evident; the structure is standard for boto3 stubs. No anomalies like hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. All classes are for type hints and static code analysis support.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of paginator class definitions for boto3, with type annotations to aid static analysis. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is detected.",
