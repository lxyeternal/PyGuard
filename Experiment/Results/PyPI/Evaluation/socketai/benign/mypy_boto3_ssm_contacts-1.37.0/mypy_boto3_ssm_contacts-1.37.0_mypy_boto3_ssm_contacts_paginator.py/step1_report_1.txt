{
  "purpose": "Define paginators for the ssm-contacts service client with type annotations and documentation links.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type definitions; class methods that call super().paginate with unpacked arguments.",
  "sinks": "The paginate methods accept **kwargs and pass them to the superclass, with no direct data sinks or external network connections.",
  "flows": "Input data (kwargs) flow into the paginate method and are passed to the base Paginator class without modification or external effect.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. The code appears to be a standard implementation of typed paginators based on boto3 documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several paginator classes for the ssm-contacts service, extending a generic Paginator class with specific result types. Type annotations are used for input parameters and return types, ensuring type safety. No data is processed or transmitted within these classes; they merely extend boto3's paginator infrastructure. The presence of documentation links and standard class structures indicates adherence to boto3's pagination pattern. No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or obfuscated code are detected. The overall structure appears legitimate and intended for use in a larger, secure application context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, well-typed set of paginator class definitions for the ssm-contacts client. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The implementation is standard, with no signs of sabotage or malware. It is safe for use within an application that utilizes boto3 for AWS interactions.",
