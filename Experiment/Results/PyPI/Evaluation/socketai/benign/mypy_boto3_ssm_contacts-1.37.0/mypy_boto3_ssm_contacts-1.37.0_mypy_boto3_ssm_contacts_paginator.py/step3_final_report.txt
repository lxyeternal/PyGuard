{
  "purpose": "Define strongly-typed paginator classes for the ssm-contacts AWS service client, serving as static type annotations and documentation wrappers for boto3.",
  "sources": "Class inheritance from boto3.paginate.Paginator, method parameters via **kwargs, type definitions imported from type_defs.",
  "sinks": "Input kwargs flow into the paginate method, which returns PageIterator objects; no external data leaks or network effects.",
  "flows": "kwargs passed into paginate methods flow directly into superclass methods, resulting in paginated responses without side effects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic execution; standard boilerplate for boto3 stubs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines paginator classes with precise type annotations, conditional import for compatibility, and documentation links. It does not process external data, perform network operations, or contain obfuscated code. The structure is consistent with boto3 stub patterns, and no malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of boto3 paginator stubs, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The high scores for malware and obfuscation are justified as zero; the risk score should be minimal (~0.1) to reflect potential misuse but is effectively negligible.",
