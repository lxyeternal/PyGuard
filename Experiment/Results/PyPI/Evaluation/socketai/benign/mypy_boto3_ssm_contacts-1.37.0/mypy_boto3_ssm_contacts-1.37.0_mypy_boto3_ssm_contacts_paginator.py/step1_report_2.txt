{
  "purpose": "This code defines Python classes for paginating through AWS SSM Contacts service responses using boto3, with type annotations and documentation links.",
  "sources": "The code reads type definitions from imported modules, and uses class methods (paginate) which accept **kwargs as input.",
  "sinks": "The paginate methods generate PageIterator objects from untrusted input (**kwargs), which could potentially be misused if combined with malicious data. However, in normal operation, these are internal methods called by client code with controlled parameters.",
  "flows": "Input data (**kwargs) flows into the paginate method, which then returns a PageIterator; there are no evident external data leaks or network calls within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is largely boilerplate class definitions for paginator wrappers; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code are present. No obfuscated or dynamic execution is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up type-safe paginator classes for AWS SDK responses, leveraging Python typing and conditional imports for compatibility. It does not include any external data sources, network operations, or code execution. The methods simply override 'paginate' to return PageIterator objects with specified type annotations. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code is structured, documented, and focused on type annotations and documentation links. Overall, it appears to be a standard, benign code pattern for boto3 paginator wrappers.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of boto3 paginator classes with type annotations for a specific AWS service. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. It functions as intended for pagination and type safety, with no evidence of malware or security risks.",
