  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Summary:** The code defines typed paginator classes for the ssm-contacts AWS service, extending boto3's Paginator, with no malicious behavior or anomalies.  \n- **Details:** The code is straightforward, primarily setting up class wrappers with type annotations, documentation links, and no data processing or external effects.  \n- **Risk & Malware:** Both are correctly scored as 0. The confidence is high (1).  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no issues detected.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is boilerplate for boto3 paginators, with no signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Details:** Focuses on the absence of external data leaks, network calls, or obfuscated code. The code is standard for static type annotations.  \n- **Risk & Malware:** Both are 0, with high confidence (0.9).  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's nature; no concerns.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code defines paginator classes with type annotations, with no malicious intent.  \n- **Details:** Highlights that the code is purely for static typing support, no data processing or network activity.  \n- **Risk & Malware:** Both scored as 0, with full confidence (1).  \n- **Assessment:** The conclusion is consistent; no malicious activity detected.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Summary:** The code provides type annotations and paginator classes for boto3, with no signs of malicious behavior.  \n- **Details:** Emphasizes that the code is standard, with conditional imports for compatibility, and no suspicious patterns.  \n- **Risk & Malware:** Both are 0, confidence is 1.  \n- **Assessment:** The analysis is appropriate; no issues found.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Summary:** The code is a type annotation module for boto3 paginators, with no malicious activity or security risks.  \n- **Details:** Notes that data flows are internal, with no external data leaks or untrusted input processing.  \n- **Risk & Malware:** Both are scored 0, with high confidence (0.9).  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; no malicious behavior.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code Behavior:** All reports agree that the code is primarily class definitions for paginators, with type annotations, documentation links, and no data processing or network activity.  \n- **Malicious Activity:** None of the reports identify any signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.  \n- **Obfuscation:** The code is clear, straightforward, and standard for boto3 stubs.  \n- **Security Risks:** The code does not handle secrets, perform network calls, or execute dynamic code.  \n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no evidence of malicious code or behavior.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is transparent and standard.  \n- **Risk Score:** **0** — no security risks detected.  \n\n**Note:** The high confidence levels and consistent reasoning across all reports support these conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-typed set of paginator class definitions for the boto3 ssm-contacts client, serving as static type annotations and documentation wrappers. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nAll evidence points to a benign, standard implementation intended for static analysis and type safety support.",
