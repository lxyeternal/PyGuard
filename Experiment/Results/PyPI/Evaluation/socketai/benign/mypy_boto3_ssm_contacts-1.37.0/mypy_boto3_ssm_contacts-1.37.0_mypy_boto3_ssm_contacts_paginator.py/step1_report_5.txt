{
  "purpose": "Provide type annotations and pagination classes for the ssm-contacts service client, facilitating type-safe iteration over paginated responses.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input directly; it defines classes and methods that process data from the boto3 client via the 'paginate' method, which internally handles untrusted data from AWS responses.",
  "sinks": "The 'paginate' methods return PageIterator objects that process data from AWS responses; these are not sinks themselves but represent flow points where data is retrieved and processed. No untrusted data is explicitly written or sent elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Data flows from AWS API responses through the paginator classes' 'paginate' methods, which return iterators over response data. No external or untrusted input sources are processed directly in this code; the data is internal to the AWS SDK response handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only class definitions and type annotations with no suspicious dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. All references are to public SDK documentation, with no obfuscated or misleading code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code defines paginator classes for the ssm-contacts AWS service, using type annotations for safe iteration. It employs conditional imports to handle different Python versions and distinguishes between type checking and runtime code. There is no evidence of malicious behavior; the code merely extends boto3's Paginator class, adding type annotations and structured pagination methods. The use of 'Unpack' and 'TYPE_CHECKING' aligns with standard type hinting practices. No untrusted data processing, network communication, or system modifications are present.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a straightforward, well-structured type annotation module for boto3 paginators, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely to facilitate type-safe pagination of AWS responses for the ssm-contacts service.",
