  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully.\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code simply assigns a static version string to the `__version__` variable.\n   - The code contains only a straightforward assignment with a copyright comment.\n   - No input/output, data processing, external data sources, or dynamic behavior is present.\n   - The code is minimal, standard practice for version declaration in Python packages.\n\n2. **Anomalies & Concerns**:\n   - The only notable point is the copyright year \"2025,\" which is in the future relative to the data cutoff (October 2023). This is unusual but not malicious.\n   - No obfuscation, suspicious constructs, or malicious code patterns are detected.\n   - No evidence of malware, malicious intent, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n3. **Scores & Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These seem appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Assumptions**:\n   - The only questionable aspect is the future year \"2025\" in the copyright comment, which could be a typo or a placeholder.\n   - However, this does not impact security or indicate malicious activity.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment**:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Overall conclusion**:\nThe code is a standard version declaration with no security concerns. The only minor anomaly is the future year in the comment, which does not affect security but could be corrected for accuracy.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendations**:\n- Keep the scores as they are: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.\n- Optionally, update the copyright year to the current or correct year for accuracy, but this does not impact security.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThe reports are consistent with my assessment.",
