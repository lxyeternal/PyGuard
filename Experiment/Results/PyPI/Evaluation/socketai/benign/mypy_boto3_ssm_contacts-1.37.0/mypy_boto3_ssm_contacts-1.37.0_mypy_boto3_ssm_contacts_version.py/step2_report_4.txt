  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to the `__version__` variable.\n   - The code is static, contains no input/output, no external data flow, and no dynamic behavior.\n   - The comments include a copyright notice, with one noting a future year (2025), which is unusual but not malicious.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior:**\n   - No reports indicate any malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The code is standard practice in Python projects for version tracking.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - No logical flaws or errors are present.\n   - The only anomaly is the future year (2025) in the copyright comment, which is likely a typo or placeholder, but not a security concern.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n5. **Risk & Malware Scores:**\n   - Since the code is purely declarative with no malicious intent, the risk score remains at 0.\n   - The malware score is correctly at 0, as there's no indication of malicious activity.\n\n6. **Potential Vulnerabilities & Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not assume any vulnerabilities; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - The future year (2025) is likely a typo or placeholder, but it doesn't introduce security issues.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Code correctness:** Confirmed as straightforward and standard.\n- **Malware score:** 0 (appropriate).\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (appropriate).\n- **Risk score:** 0 (appropriate).\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard version declaration with no security concerns, malicious intent, or obfuscation. The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is trivial, and there are no indications of malicious or obfuscated code. The only oddity is the future year in the comment, which is likely a typo or placeholder, not a security issue.\n\n**Final note:**  \nAll scores are appropriate as reported. No changes needed.",
