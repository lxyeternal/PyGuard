  "purpose": "Declare the version of the package.",
  "sources": "Assignment of the string '1.37.0' to the __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process external input or data.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignment with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a future year '2025' in the comment, which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static assignment of a version string, accompanied by a copyright comment. No dynamic data, external inputs, or complex logic are present. The only notable point is the future year '2025', which may be a typo or placeholder, but it does not impact security. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with full confidence. No suspicious patterns, malicious behavior, or vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign version declaration with no security concerns or malicious intent. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. The only minor anomaly is the future year in the comment, which does not affect security.",
