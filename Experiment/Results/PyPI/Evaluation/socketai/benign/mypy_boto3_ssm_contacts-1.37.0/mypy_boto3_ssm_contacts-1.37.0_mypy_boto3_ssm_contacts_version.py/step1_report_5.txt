  "purpose": "Defines the version of the package or module as a string.",
  "sources": "The string assignment to __version__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no suspicious or unusual constructs; the copyright notice is standard, and the version string appears normal.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a module-level variable __version__ to a version string. It includes a copyright comment with a future year (2025), which is unusual but not malicious. No input/output, no data processing, no external data sources, and no malicious code patterns. The code is straightforward and typical for version declaration in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a standard version declaration with a copyright comment. No malicious behavior, no security risks detected.",
