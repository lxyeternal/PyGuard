  "purpose": "Load package configuration data from a static JSON string, read README.md for long description, and invoke setuptools.setup() to prepare a Python package.",
  "sources": "The static JSON string containing package metadata, and the 'README.md' file being read for long description.",
  "sinks": "The setuptools.setup() function which consumes the package metadata and description.",
  "flows": "JSON data is parsed into kwargs, which are then passed to setuptools.setup(); README.md content is read and assigned to kwargs['long_description'].",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a standard setup script with static data and no suspicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The code loads static package metadata from a JSON string, reads a README file, and calls setuptools.setup() with this data. No dynamic code execution, network activity, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The JSON contains only benign package info, dependencies, and URLs. The code is straightforward and follows standard practices. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious URLs are detected. The overall structure and content are typical for a Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package setup process with no malicious or security concerns. All signals indicate a safe and straightforward configuration, with no anomalies or suspicious behavior.",
