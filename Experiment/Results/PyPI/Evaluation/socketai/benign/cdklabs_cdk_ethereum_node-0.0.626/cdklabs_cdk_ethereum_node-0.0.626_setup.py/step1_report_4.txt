{
  "purpose": "The code prepares package metadata and configuration for distribution using setuptools, primarily to define and install a Python package related to Ethereum node deployment.",
  "sources": "The JSON string containing package metadata, the external README.md file read operation",
  "sinks": "The setup function call passing metadata for package installation",
  "flows": "JSON data is parsed and used as arguments for setuptools.setup(), which configures package installation",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. The code performs standard setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script loads package metadata from a JSON string, reads a README.md file for a long description, and calls setuptools.setup() with the parsed data. There are no dynamic code executions, obfuscated elements, or suspicious network or file operations. All activities are typical for Python package setup scripts. The code's purpose appears solely to define package information for distribution. No anomalies or malicious patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It simply reads metadata and README content to configure package installation.",
