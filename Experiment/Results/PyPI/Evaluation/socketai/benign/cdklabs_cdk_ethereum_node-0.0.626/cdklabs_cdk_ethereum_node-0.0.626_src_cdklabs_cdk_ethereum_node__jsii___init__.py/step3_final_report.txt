{
  "purpose": "Standard package setup involving namespace extension, dynamic JSII assembly loading, typeguard configuration, and publishing metadata.",
  "sources": "Module imports, __path__ extension, version retrieval via importlib.metadata, dynamic assembly load with jsii.JSIIAssembly.load",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no network or file operations; no external data leaks",
  "flows": "Source inputs (version info, module imports) influence assembly loading and typeguard configuration but do not lead to untrusted data flow or external effects",
  "anomalies": "Use of __path__ extension, dynamic assembly loading, and version-based configuration are typical in CDK packages; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup tasks for a Python package utilizing JSII and AWS CDK, with type safety via typeguard, dynamic assembly loading, and publishing. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The assembly load is typical for such packages, and no external network activity or data leaks are evident. The use of version info for configuration is standard. Overall, the code is benign and aligns with common patterns in CDK constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe setup script for a JSII-based AWS CDK package, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The supply chain security posture is strong, and the risk is minimal.",
