  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code defines a Python class for deploying an Ethereum node on AWS Managed Blockchain via CDK constructs, primarily reading constructor parameters and type hints.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No evidence of untrusted data processing, external outputs, or data leaks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The code appears straightforward, following standard CDK patterns, with no suspicious or malicious code segments.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Clearly benign, with high confidence (1.0). No malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n\n**Assessment:** The code is a standard CDK construct with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the standard nature of the code with no suspicious patterns or malicious intent. The analysis confirms the code's benign purpose.\n\n**Assessment:** Also safe, with high confidence (1.0).\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Reiterates that the code is a typical CDK construct, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. Slightly lower confidence (0.95) but still very high.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Focuses on the code's structure, type checking, and property management, all standard for CDK constructs. No network calls, external commands, or data exfiltration observed.\n\n**Assessment:** Safe, with high confidence (0.9).\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Similar conclusion: the code defines a class for deploying Ethereum nodes, with no suspicious or malicious logic, and follows standard patterns.\n\n**Assessment:** No security issues detected.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** None of the reports identify any actual vulnerabilities, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscation & Malware:** All reports consistently indicate no obfuscation or malware.\n- **Security Risks:** The code is purely infrastructure-as-code, with no external inputs processed insecurely, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious logic.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a standard, well-structured CDK construct for deploying Ethereum nodes on AWS. It includes type checking, property validation, and proper use of enums, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- The reported scores (malware, obfuscated, security risk) are all appropriately low or zero.\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n\n| Aspect          | Score | Justification                                                                                     |\n|-----------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Malware**    | 0.0    | No malicious code, suspicious behavior, or external command execution detected.               |\n| **Obfuscated** | 0.0    | Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation patterns.                                       |\n| **Risk**       | 0.0    | No security risks identified; code is purely for resource provisioning.                       |\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code is safe, standard infrastructure code with no malicious or security concerns.",
