{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python class and related structures to deploy and configure an Ethereum node on Amazon Managed Blockchain via AWS CDK constructs.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in constructor and property getters; class definitions; type hints; imported modules.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processing or external system interactions; no network or file operations with untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; parameter inputs are used for configuration but are not processed in a malicious way.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a standard CDK construct definition with proper type checking. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic are present. The presence of standard imports and property definitions suggests normal behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical CDK construct implementation for deploying Ethereum nodes, including enum definitions, data classes, and class properties. No code injection, dynamic execution, or suspicious code paths are present. All functions and classes serve to configure deployment parameters. The type hints and validation functions are standard for ensuring proper usage. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code; the code's structure and content are consistent with open-source CDK construct patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign, standard implementation of an AWS CDK construct for Ethereum node deployment. No malicious or sabotage behavior detected. The code does not contain malware, backdoors, or security risks beyond normal configuration scope.",
