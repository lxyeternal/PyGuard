{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Python class for creating an Ethereum node on Amazon Managed Blockchain, supporting multiple networks and configurable properties.",
  "sources": "Imports modules for type checking, JSII, and constructs; reads class and function definitions; reads default values for properties and enums; processes constructor arguments and type hints.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; no network calls, file operations, or data leak points evident in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Constructor inputs (scope, id, properties) flow into object creation via JSII; property getters access internal values; no external data or user input flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Usage of external libraries (jsii, constructs) is standard for CDK constructs. No obfuscated or suspicious code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a CDK construct class with associated properties and enums. It includes type checking, property definitions, and constructor logic consistent with AWS CDK patterns. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network manipulation, or backdoors is apparent. The code appears to serve its intended purpose of defining infrastructure as code without introducing security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CDK construct implementation for deploying an Ethereum node with configurable properties. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this module. It adheres to expected patterns for infrastructure as code and does not contain suspicious or malicious logic.",
