{
  "purpose": "Define a Python class for deploying an Ethereum node on Amazon Managed Blockchain using AWS CDK.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, jsii, publication, typeguard, importlib.metadata, and internal module imports; class constructors and property getters; type checking functions.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks like network connections, file writes, or data exfiltration points; class properties access internal data only.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of EthereumNode with properties flows into jsii.create; property access flows from class properties to jsii.get.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious function calls. The code appears to be a standard CDK construct definition with type checking and property management. No malicious behavior or backdoors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a class for infrastructure deployment, including property validation via type guards, and utilizes jsii for cross-language compatibility. No network or system commands, data exfiltration, or malicious logic are present. The use of typeguard for runtime type checking is standard. The class properties simply access internal stored values. The code structure and content are consistent with a typical CDK construct module.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of a CDK construct for deploying an Ethereum node, with standard type validation and property management. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
