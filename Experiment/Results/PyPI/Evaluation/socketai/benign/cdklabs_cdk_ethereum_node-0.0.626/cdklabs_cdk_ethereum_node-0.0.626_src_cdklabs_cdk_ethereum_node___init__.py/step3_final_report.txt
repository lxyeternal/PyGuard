{
  "purpose": "Defines a Python class 'EthereumNode' as a CDK construct for deploying Ethereum nodes on AWS Managed Blockchain, with configurable network, instance type, and availability zone.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters, type hints, imported modules, class property getters, and enum definitions.",
  "sinks": "No external data processing, network connections, file writes, or command executions; data flows are limited to configuration parameters and internal property access.",
  "flows": "Constructor parameters to class properties; property getters retrieving internal state; no external or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code segments; code follows standard CDK construct patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard infrastructure-as-code module defining a CDK construct for Ethereum nodes. It includes type checking, property validation, enum usage, and property accessors. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious logic is present. The structure and content are typical for resource provisioning code, with no signs of obfuscation or malware. The code's purpose is clear and benign, and it does not process untrusted data insecurely.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured AWS CDK construct for deploying Ethereum nodes. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The high scores assigned in the reports are justified as 0.0 for malware, 0.0 for obfuscation, and 0.0 for security risk.",
