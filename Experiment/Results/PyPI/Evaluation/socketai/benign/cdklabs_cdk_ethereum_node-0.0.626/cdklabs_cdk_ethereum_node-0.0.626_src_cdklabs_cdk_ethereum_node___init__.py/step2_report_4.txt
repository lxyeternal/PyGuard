  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its behavior, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It defines a CDK construct class `EthereumNode` with associated properties, enums for network types and instance types.\n- It includes type checking functions and property getters.\n- It uses standard libraries, jsii, and constructs.\n- No external inputs are processed in a malicious way.\n- No network calls, file writes, or data exfiltration points are evident.\n- The code appears to be a typical infrastructure-as-code module for deploying Ethereum nodes on AWS.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of each report:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Accurate; defines a CDK construct for Ethereum node deployment.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No untrusted data or external system interactions.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis:** Correct; standard pattern, no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate code.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.0, Obfuscated 0.0, Risk 0.0 — **reasonable.**\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the standard nature of the code.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.0, Obfuscated 0.0, Risk 0.0 — **appropriate.**\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Again, consistent with previous assessments.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.0, Obfuscated 0.0, Risk 0.0 — **justified.**\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar findings; the code is standard.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.0, Obfuscated 0.0, Risk 0.0 — **reasonable.**\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same conclusion; the code is a typical CDK construct.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.0, Obfuscated 0.0, Risk 0.0 — **appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is consistent with the code's behavior. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is correct given the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is justified as the code is purely infrastructure setup with no security issues.\n\n### **Final Justification:**\n\n- The code is a standard AWS CDK construct module for deploying Ethereum nodes.\n- It contains no secrets, no malicious code, no obfuscation.\n- It does not process untrusted data in any dangerous way.\n- The type checking functions and property accessors are standard and do not introduce security risks.\n- The purpose is clear: infrastructure provisioning.\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 (no security risks identified)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports' assessments are accurate. The code is safe, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated content. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the scores at 0.0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk. The code is safe for use in production environments.",
