{
  "purpose": "The code defines a CDK construct for deploying Ethereum nodes on Amazon Managed Blockchain, including configuration options and enums for network types and instance sizes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules, type hints, and constructor parameters for 'EthereumNode' and its properties.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that process or output untrusted data directly; the code primarily defines data structures and a class for deployment.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to the 'EthereumNode' constructor flow into the creation of the construct; no untrusted data flows into sensitive operations or external communications.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard CDK construct definition, with no suspicious or malicious code segments. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The import statements and class definitions are typical for infrastructure-as-code modules.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical CDK construct implementation for deploying Ethereum nodes, including type checking and property definitions. No network communications, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors are identified. The code focuses on defining properties and enums relevant to node deployment, and the functions serve as type check stubs. The structure and content do not exhibit signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard infrastructure construct for deploying Ethereum nodes with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is a legitimate component of a deployment pipeline, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
