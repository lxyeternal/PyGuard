  "purpose": "Initialize the opengeode library and its surface processing components.",
  "sources": "Import of 'opengeode' library and local module '.bin.geode_common_py_cutter_surface'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, network activity, or data exfiltration points identified.",
  "flows": "Import statements leading to the call to 'CommonCutterSurfaceLibrary.initialize()'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a local module path '.bin.geode_common_py_cutter_surface' which may be compiled or bundled, but no suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward library import and initialization. No malicious, obfuscated, or insecure patterns are present. The local module path is unusual but not inherently malicious. No data leaks, network activity, or suspicious logic are evident. The malware score is appropriately zero; the obfuscated score is zero; the security risk score is minimal (~0.1), reflecting standard setup routines without security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a typical initialization routine for a geometric processing library. No evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities is found. The scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
