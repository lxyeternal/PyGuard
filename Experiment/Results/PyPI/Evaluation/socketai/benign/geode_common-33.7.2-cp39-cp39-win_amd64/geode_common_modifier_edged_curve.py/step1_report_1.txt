{
  "purpose": "The code initializes a library related to Geode solutions, likely for geometric or computational tasks.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'opengeode' and initialization call for 'CommonModifierEdgedCurveLibrary'.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no untrusted data handling or output functions are present.",
  "flows": "Import 'opengeode' → call 'CommonModifierEdgedCurveLibrary.initialize()'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a potentially custom or proprietary library 'opengeode'; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports an open-source library 'opengeode' and calls an initialization function from a local module. There is no evidence of data flows from untrusted sources, nor any suspicious or malicious code constructs. The only actions are library import and initialization, which are standard and benign. No anomalies or unusual behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward initialization of a geospatial or geometric processing library without malicious intent or security risks.",
