  "purpose": "Minimal setup of the opengeode library with initialization call.",
  "sources": "Import of 'opengeode' module and local module '.bin.geode_common_py_core'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or outputs involved.",
  "flows": "Import statements leading to the initialization call of CommonCoreLibrary.",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative import from 'bin' directory in report 3; otherwise standard code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward library import and initialization. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The relative import in report 3 is slightly unusual but not malicious. Scores for malware and obfuscation are correctly zero; security risk scores are low (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal concern. The code is typical for setting up a library environment with no external data handling or network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The minor relative import does not imply malicious behavior but warrants a review of the local module. Overall, the security risk is minimal, and the code is safe for use.",
