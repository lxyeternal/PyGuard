  "purpose": "Initialize the CommonCoreLibrary from the opengeode package",
  "sources": "Importing opengeode module and local geode_common_py_core module",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or output observed",
  "flows": "Import opengeode -> Import geode_common_py_core -> Call initialize() method",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward initialization, no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code imports the opengeode library, then imports all symbols from a local module, and calls an initialization method on CommonCoreLibrary. There are no signs of data leaks, malicious behavior, or obfuscated code. The import of a presumably legitimate library and the initialization call are standard procedures in setup code. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard initialization routine for a Python library, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns.",
