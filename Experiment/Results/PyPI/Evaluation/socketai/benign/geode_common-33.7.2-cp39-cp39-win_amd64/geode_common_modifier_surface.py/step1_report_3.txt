  "purpose": "Initialize the CommonModifierSurfaceLibrary using opengeode and import related modules.",
  "sources": "Import statement for opengeode and local module 'geode_common_py_modifier_surface'.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks present; no input/output operations, network calls, or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Import dependencies are loaded; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks detected.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. The only operation is library initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'opengeode' library and a local module, then calls an initialize method on CommonModifierSurfaceLibrary. This appears to be standard library setup code. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward, serving as setup for further operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate initialization code for a geometry processing library, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
