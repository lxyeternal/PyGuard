  "purpose": "Initialize a module from the opengeode package and a common modifier surface library for further processing.",
  "sources": "Import statement for opengeode, import of geode_common_py_modifier_surface, and the initialize() call.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Import opengeode -> import geode_common_py_modifier_surface -> call to initialize()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious imports beyond standard library and known package.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a known open-source library 'opengeode' and a specific module from a relative path. It then calls an initialize method on CommonModifierSurfaceLibrary. There are no inputs, data flows from untrusted sources, or external network connections. No suspicious behavior or malicious code patterns detected. The code appears to be a standard initialization of a module with no signs of sabotage, malware, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple initialization script for a geode-related library. It does not contain malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscated code. The overall security risk is negligible.",
