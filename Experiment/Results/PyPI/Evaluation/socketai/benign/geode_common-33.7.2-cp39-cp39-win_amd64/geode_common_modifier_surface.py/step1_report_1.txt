  "purpose": "Initialize the CommonModifierSurfaceLibrary by importing the opengeode module and executing its initialize() method.",
  "sources": "Import statement for opengeode and the CommonModifierSurfaceLibrary.initialize() call.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Import opengeode module -> call initialize() on CommonModifierSurfaceLibrary.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard library import and initialization. The import path appears to be from a local module, which is not suspicious in itself.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a well-known library 'opengeode' and executes an initialization method on a class from a relative module path. There are no hardcoded secrets, no network operations, no data leakage, or suspicious behavior. The code is minimal and straightforward, performing standard library initialization. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard initialization script for a Python library related to geospatial or geometric data processing. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident.",
