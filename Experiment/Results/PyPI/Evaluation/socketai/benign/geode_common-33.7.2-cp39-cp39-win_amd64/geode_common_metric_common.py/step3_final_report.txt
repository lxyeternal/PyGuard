  "purpose": "Initialization of the CommonMetricLibrary for geode computations.",
  "sources": "Importing 'opengeode' library and local module '.bin.geode_common_py_metric'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows are present.",
  "flows": "Import statements lead to the call to CommonMetricLibrary.initialize(), which is a standard setup flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative import from 'bin' directory is somewhat unusual but not suspicious; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and performs standard library initialization. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or external network activity. The import path from 'bin' is atypical but not inherently malicious. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup routine with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No modifications are necessary.",
