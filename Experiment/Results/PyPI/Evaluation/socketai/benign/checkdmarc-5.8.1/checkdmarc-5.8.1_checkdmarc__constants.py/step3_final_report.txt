  "purpose": "Define static constants including OS information and user agent string for use in network requests or identification.",
  "sources": "platform.system(), platform.release()",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or output data",
  "flows": "None; static assignment of constants",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static code with no suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code imports platform to determine OS details and constructs a user agent string with version info. It contains no dynamic execution, no input handling, and no obfuscated or malicious code. The license and version info are standard comments. The code appears benign and well-structured. The reports provided are empty, indicating no evidence or detailed findings. Given the absence of any suspicious activity, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation, the code is considered safe. The lack of content in the reports suggests they are placeholders or incomplete, not indicative of issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign constants module with no malicious behavior or vulnerabilities. The reports are empty and do not provide any evidence of issues. Therefore, the overall security assessment is that the code is safe, with no malware or obfuscation present.",
