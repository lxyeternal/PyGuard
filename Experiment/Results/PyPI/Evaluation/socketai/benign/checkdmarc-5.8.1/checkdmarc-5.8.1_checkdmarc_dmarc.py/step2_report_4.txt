  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's logic, potential vulnerabilities, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a comprehensive DMARC DNS record validation module, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or malware. It performs standard DNS lookups, parsing, and validation per RFCs. The confidence is high (0.95), and malware risk is zero.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code's purpose is DNS record validation, with robust error handling and no suspicious behavior. The malware score of 0 aligns with the analysis.\n\n- **Score suggestion:** No change needed. The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are reasonable given the detailed, standard validation logic.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is a secure, DNS validation utility for DMARC records, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity. Confidence is high (0.95), malware=0.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. The code is focused on DNS queries, parsing, and validation, with appropriate error handling. No malicious intent is detected.\n\n- **Score suggestion:** No change needed. The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard DNS validation utility for DMARC, with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage. It performs DNS lookups, syntax validation, and report URI verification.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is accurate. The code's operations are typical for DNS validation, with no suspicious behaviors. The malware score remains 0.\n\n- **Score suggestion:** No change needed. The malware=0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code validates and verifies DMARC DNS records, including report URI checks, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs DNS lookups, syntax validation, and error handling.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly identifies that the code's functions are standard DNS record validation routines, with no malicious activity.\n\n- **Score suggestion:** No change needed. Malware=0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides DNS querying, parsing, and validation for DMARC records, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage. It performs standard DNS lookups and validations.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The code's purpose is security validation, and no malicious activity is detected.\n\n- **Score suggestion:** No change needed. Malware=0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, and the code's operations are standard DNS validation routines with no malicious intent or behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports agree on 0, as the code is clear, well-structured, and not obfuscated.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation, but generally low (around 0.1-0.2), reflecting the code's benign purpose but acknowledging that DNS validation can be part of larger attack vectors if misused. Given the detailed analysis, a risk score of 0.1-0.2 is reasonable.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (standard DNS validation code with minimal inherent risk)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a legitimate, security-focused DNS validation utility for DMARC records, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The scores assigned by the reports are accurate and justified.",
