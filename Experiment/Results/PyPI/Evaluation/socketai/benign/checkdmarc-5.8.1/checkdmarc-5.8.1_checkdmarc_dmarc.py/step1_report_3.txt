{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to validate and parse DMARC DNS records for domains, ensuring proper configuration and compliance with RFC standards.",
  "sources": "DNS DNS TXT records via query_dns, user-provided domain input, DNS resolver responses, DNS exceptions, email addresses extracted from report URIs",
  "sinks": "None detected; no functions directly perform data leaks or system modification based on untrusted input",
  "flows": "Input domain data -> DNS TXT record queries -> DNS response parsing -> report URI parsing -> MX record checks -> warnings or errors based on validation results",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. The code is primarily focused on DNS record validation and parsing. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, or unusual variable use was observed.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly performs DNS queries to retrieve DMARC records, validates their syntax, and verifies report URIs and MX records. Exception handling is used to manage DNS errors and anomalies, raising specific custom exceptions. All operations are consistent with security validation of DNS records; no suspicious or malicious activity such as data exfiltration, remote command execution, or network connections outside DNS queries is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured DNS record validation utility for DMARC, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It is designed solely for configuration validation and compliance checks, with no dangerous or malicious operations detected.",
