{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to retrieve, validate, and parse DMARC DNS records for domains, providing detailed warnings and validation results.",
  "sources": "DNS DNS resolver responses, DNS query functions (query_dns), user input for domain names, report URIs, and DNS records obtained during DNS queries.",
  "sinks": "Potential injection or data leak points are minimal; mainly DNS data handling and processing DNS records. No direct untrusted input execution or external command calls observed.",
  "flows": "DNS records are fetched from DNS servers; records are parsed and validated; report URIs are processed and validated; warnings are generated based on record content; errors are raised for malformed or multiple records.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns identified. The code uses standard DNS querying and parsing logic. No obfuscated code, malicious data exfiltration, or network communications to suspicious domains are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs DNS TXT record lookups for _dmarc subdomains, handles multiple and unrelated records, parses DMARC records with regex and formal grammar, and validates report URIs. No suspicious behavior such as network connections beyond DNS, code injection, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. DNS queries are executed via utility functions, with error handling to raise specific exceptions. The logic appears to be security-focused, validating DNS configurations per RFCs, and providing warnings and errors accordingly.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a comprehensive, well-structured DMARC DNS record validation module with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It performs standard DNS lookups, record parsing, and validation according to RFC standards. No malware or malicious behaviors are detected.",
