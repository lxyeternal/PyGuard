  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's behavior, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code performs standard DNS querying, parsing, and HTTP fetching for MTA-STS validation. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is observed.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low, as it's a standard validation process)\n- **Comments:** The reasoning is sound. The code strictly handles DNS and HTTP operations related to email security validation, with proper error handling and no signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's assessment aligns with the code's actual behavior. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing DNS TXT record queries, policy download, and parsing, with no suspicious or malicious activities.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Comments:** The reasoning is consistent. The code performs expected validation steps without malicious actions.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on DNS TXT record validation, HTTP policy retrieval, and parsing, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low, typical for validation code)\n- **Comments:** The analysis correctly identifies that the code is standard for MTA-STS validation, with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusions are justified. No changes.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Describes DNS querying, HTTP fetching, and parsing, with no malicious or suspicious operations.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, standard validation)\n- **Comments:** The reasoning is sound. The code performs expected validation steps without malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues with the report's assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, focusing on DNS and HTTP operations for MTA-STS validation, with no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Comments:** The analysis is consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify that the code does not exhibit malicious behavior. Given the code's purpose—DNS querying, policy retrieval, and parsing—this is expected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Zero across all reports, as the code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly varied but generally low, reflecting the nature of the code as a validation utility.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** **0**  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Estimated risk score:** **0.1 - 0.2** (consistent with the reports)\n\n**Rationale:** The code performs standard DNS and HTTP operations for email security validation. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage are present. The low risk scores reflect the benign nature of the functionality.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their analysis. The code is a legitimate, security-focused implementation of MTA-STS validation with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected.",
