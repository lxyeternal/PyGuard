  "purpose": "The script validates and parses email-related DNS records for given domains or domain lists, providing JSON or CSV output with domain security data.",
  "sources": "Reads input domains from command-line arguments or a file, reads a domain list file if specified.",
  "sinks": "Outputs results to console or files specified by user (JSON or CSV), writes data to files if specified.",
  "flows": "Input domain data -> check_domains function processes data -> results converted to JSON/CSV -> output to stdout or files",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs. Uses standard logging and argument parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code securely handles input arguments, reads domain data either from command-line or file, and processes it through the check_domains function. Output handling is straightforward, converting results to JSON or CSV, then printing or writing to files. No dynamic code execution, network communication, or data leaks observed. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The code appears well-structured, with no hidden backdoors, no suspicious hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated sections.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, security-focused DNS validation tool with no detectable malicious behavior or sabotage. It responsibly handles input and output without suspicious activity. No malware or security risks identified.",
