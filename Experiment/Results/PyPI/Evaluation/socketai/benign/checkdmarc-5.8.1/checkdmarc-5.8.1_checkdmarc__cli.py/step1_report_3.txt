  "purpose": "The script validates and parses email-related DNS records, including checking domains against specified criteria and outputting results in JSON or CSV format.",
  "sources": "Input from command line arguments, including domains, file inputs, and optional parameters like name servers and MX hostnames.",
  "sinks": "Output generated by 'results_to_json', 'results_to_csv', and 'output_to_file' functions; console printing; file writing.",
  "flows": "Input is read from command line or file, processed through 'check_domains', results are formatted, then written to output files or printed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed. The code handles standard command-line argument parsing, file reading, and output formatting. No hardcoded credentials or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs argument parsing, reads domain lists from files, and invokes 'check_domains' to analyze DNS records. Logging levels are managed, with optional debugging. Output is saved to files or printed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activities are evident. The code appears to be a legitimate DNS validation tool. No indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured DNS validation utility without malicious intent. It processes domain data, outputs results securely, and does not contain suspicious or malicious constructs.",
