{
  "purpose": "A command-line utility for validating and parsing email-related DNS records, including DMARC, SPF, and MX records.",
  "sources": "User input domains (via arguments or file), environment variables (indirectly through external functions), and file outputs.",
  "sinks": "File outputs specified by user; no direct data leaks or network sinks are evident within this code.",
  "flows": "Input domains are read from arguments or files, passed to 'check_domains', results are processed and then outputted to stdout or files depending on user options.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; external functions are assumed safe based on context.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI tool that handles user input, reads domain lists, invokes external DNS validation functions, and outputs results. No malicious or suspicious patterns are present. The code does not perform network activity beyond DNS queries, nor does it contain obfuscated code or hidden backdoors. The external functions are not provided but are presumed standard. The input handling and output formatting are typical for such utilities. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured DNS validation CLI utility with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk and malware scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No modifications are necessary.",
