{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to validate and parse email-related DNS records for given domains, providing output in JSON or CSV format.",
  "sources": "Reads input domains from command line arguments or a file; reads configuration flags from command line options.",
  "sinks": "Outputs results to console or files specified by the user; potentially writes JSON or CSV data to user-defined paths.",
  "flows": "Input domains → check_domains function processes domain data → results converted to JSON or CSV → output written to specified files or printed to console.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution observed. No external network connections or system modifications detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a command-line utility that handles user input, reads domain lists, and calls external functions to perform DNS checks. It includes standard logging and argument parsing. No suspicious logic, such as data exfiltration, network connections beyond DNS queries, or hidden backdoors, is present. The only potential concern is that it can write output to user-specified files, but this is standard for CLI tools and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate DNS validation tool with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It strictly performs DNS checks and handles input/output operations securely. No indicators of security risks or malware were identified.",
