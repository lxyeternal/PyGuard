{
  "purpose": "The code performs DNSSEC validation, DNS record retrieval, and caching for domain security checks.",
  "sources": "DNS queries for DNSKEY, TLSA, and other DNS records; input domain names; DNS response data.",
  "sinks": "DNS response processing; validation functions; cache storage; logging outputs.",
  "flows": "Input domain -> DNS query -> DNS response -> DNSSEC validation -> Cache update -> Return result.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; exception handling is broad but standard.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard DNSSEC validation and DNS record retrieval with appropriate caching and error handling. It uses common libraries and performs expected operations without malicious activity. No obfuscation or backdoors are present. Exception handling is broad but only logs errors. The code's purpose is legitimate, and no suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate DNSSEC validation utility with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or backdoors. It performs standard DNS operations securely and transparently. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risk in DNS validation functions.",
