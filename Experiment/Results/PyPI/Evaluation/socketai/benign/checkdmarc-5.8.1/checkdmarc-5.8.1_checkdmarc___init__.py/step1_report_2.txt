{
  "purpose": "The code validates and parses email-related DNS records for domains, including SPF, DMARC, MX, and other email security checks.",
  "sources": "Reads domain input strings, DNS responses via checkdmarc utilities, environment variables (indirectly), and potentially user-supplied domain names.",
  "sinks": "Outputs JSON and CSV reports, writes to files, and calls external DNS resolution functions. No direct data leaks or external network connections are evident in this code.",
  "flows": "Domain strings are cleaned and used to query DNS records; data flows from DNS responses into structured results, then into JSON/CSV outputs or files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation detected. Use of standard libraries, no dynamic code execution, no unusual code constructs. No evident malware behavior such as network exfiltration, reverse shells, or system manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs domain validation, DNS record checks, and generates reports without any indicators of malicious intent. It utilizes standard libraries and functions from the checkdmarc package to perform security checks. There are no signs of malicious data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors. The code appears designed for security analysis and reporting only, with safe file writing and data handling. Overall, it exhibits legitimate behavior consistent with a security auditing tool.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a domain security analysis utility with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It uses standard libraries and functions for DNS and email security checks, generates structured reports, and writes to files in a safe manner. No indicators of malware or malicious activity are present.",
