  "purpose": "A utility for validating and parsing email-related DNS records such as SPF, DMARC, MTA-STS, BIMI, and SMTP TLS reporting, to assess email domain security configurations.",
  "sources": "DNS queries via functions like get_nameservers, check_mta_sts, check_spf, check_dmarc, and related functions reading DNS records and domain data.",
  "sinks": "Output functions generating JSON and CSV reports; data flows from DNS responses to structured report data.",
  "flows": "Input domain data -> DNS lookups and checks -> parse results -> format and output reports.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard DNS and email security checks using external modules, with clear data flow and no obfuscated or malicious code. It handles DNS queries, parses results, and outputs structured reports in JSON and CSV formats. No signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage are present. External modules are assumed trustworthy. The code uses standard libraries and practices, with no dynamic code execution or network activity outside DNS lookups. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's behavior and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, purpose-specific email DNS validation utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The security assessment and scores are justified and align with the code's behavior.",
