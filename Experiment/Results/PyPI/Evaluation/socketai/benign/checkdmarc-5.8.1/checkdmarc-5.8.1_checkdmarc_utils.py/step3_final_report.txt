{
  "purpose": "The code provides DNS utility functions for querying DNS records (A, AAAA, TXT, NS, MX, PTR), domain parsing, and caching, intended for use in domain analysis and validation tasks.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function arguments such as domain names, IP addresses, and optional resolver configurations.",
  "sinks": "Potentially outputs DNS query results; no untrusted data is directly executed or injected into system commands or files.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (domains/IPs) are processed through DNS queries, with results cached; data flows from inputs through DNS resolution functions to returned answer lists.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected; regexes and exception handling are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard DNS queries with proper exception handling, caching, and domain parsing. No malicious payloads, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. It uses external libraries appropriately and handles errors gracefully. The functions operate within expected parameters, and no suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented DNS utility module with no signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation. The current malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk (~0.1) are justified and appropriate.",
