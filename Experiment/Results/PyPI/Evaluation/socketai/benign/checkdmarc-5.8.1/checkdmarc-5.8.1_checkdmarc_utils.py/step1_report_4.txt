{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for querying DNS records, including A, AAAA, TXT, MX, NS, and reverse DNS, with caching and domain parsing features.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include domain names and IP addresses passed as function arguments, and DNS responses obtained via the dns.resolver library.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are DNS queries made through the dns.resolver.resolve method, which could be exploited if inputs are untrusted; the code also processes DNS responses, but does not write to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (domains/IPs) to DNS query functions; responses are processed and returned, with optional caching; no untrusted data is directed to external systems outside DNS querying.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs DNS queries and caches results; no hardcoded credentials or secrets are detected; no obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution is present; the only regexes are for pattern matching URLs and email addresses, not malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script implements standard DNS utility functions with careful exception handling. DNS queries are performed using the dns.resolver library, with caching to optimize repeated lookups. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or network communications beyond DNS requests. The code handles various DNS record types and includes safeguards against common DNS errors. The license information and comments are standard. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. Overall, this appears to be a legitimate DNS utility module with no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard DNS utility library with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs DNS lookups, caching, and domain parsing safely. No malware, backdoors, or malicious data leaks are detected. The overall security risk is minimal.",
