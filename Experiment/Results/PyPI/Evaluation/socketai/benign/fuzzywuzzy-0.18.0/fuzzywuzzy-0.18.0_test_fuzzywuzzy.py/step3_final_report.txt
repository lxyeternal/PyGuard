{
  "purpose": "This code is a comprehensive test suite for the fuzzywuzzy library, validating string processing, fuzzy matching scores, Unicode handling, and code style compliance.",
  "sources": "Static predefined strings used within test cases for string processing and comparison functions.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data flows; no network, file, or system modifications; all data is internal and controlled.",
  "flows": "Test functions operate on static data without external input; no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, well-structured, and uses standard testing patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured unit test suite for fuzzywuzzy, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It operates solely on static data, performs internal assertions, and imports common libraries. No external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe test suite with no malicious intent or security concerns. All evidence supports a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
