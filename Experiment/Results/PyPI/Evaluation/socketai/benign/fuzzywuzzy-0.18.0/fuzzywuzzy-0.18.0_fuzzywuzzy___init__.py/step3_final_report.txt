  "purpose": "Declare package version information as metadata.",
  "sources": "No external sources; only a version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no external communication or data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple declaration of a version string with a UTF-8 encoding comment. It contains no logic, input/output, external communication, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no suspicious or malicious behavior. The scores assigned (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serves solely as package metadata, and poses no security threat. The assessments and scores across all reports are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
