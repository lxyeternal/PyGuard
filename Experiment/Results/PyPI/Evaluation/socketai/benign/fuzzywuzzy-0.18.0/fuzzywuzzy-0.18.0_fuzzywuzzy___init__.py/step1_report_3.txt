  "anomalies": "Very minimal code, no anomalies or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code only defines a UTF-8 encoding comment, a version variable assignment, and nothing else. There are no inputs, no external data reads, no execution flow beyond variable assignment. No obfuscated or malicious code is present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple version assignment with no malicious behavior or security concerns. It appears to be standard package metadata.",
