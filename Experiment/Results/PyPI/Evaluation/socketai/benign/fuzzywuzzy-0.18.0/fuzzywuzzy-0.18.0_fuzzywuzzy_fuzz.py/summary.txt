  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign fuzzy matching utility with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this assessment. The only minor adjustment is to set the security risk score to 0 instead of 0.1 in report 5, for full consistency."
