  "purpose": "Setup script for the fuzzywuzzy Python package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading version from __version__, reading 'README.rst' for long description, importing modules, including package and dependency specifications.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file writing, or system modification occurs beyond reading files.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; data is read from local files and used for package setup metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior; standard setup script conventions are used. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports package version information, reads a local README file for description, and configures package setup parameters. It includes conditional import for setuptools. All operations are typical for a setup script, with no signs of malicious intent. The code's structure is straightforward and consistent with standard packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package without any malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard package configuration tasks safely.",
