  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the 'fuzzywuzzy' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version from the 'fuzzywuzzy' module and reads the 'README.rst' file for long_description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code does not process or execute untrusted input.",
  "flows": "The version is imported from the package and used directly; the 'README.rst' is read for description, with no user input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily contains package setup information. It imports the package version and reads a README file to populate metadata fields. The use of 'try-except' for import fallback is standard. No data is read from or written to external sources dynamically or insecurely. No code injection, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns observed. The code adheres to common Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard setup configuration file for the 'fuzzywuzzy' package. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
