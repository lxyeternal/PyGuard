{
  "purpose": "This code is a standard Python setup script for packaging the 'fuzzywuzzy' library, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads version from the package (__version__), reads 'README.rst' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; only local file reads and package setup operations.",
  "flows": "Source: __version__ variable and 'README.rst' file; Sink: setup() function configuring package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs straightforward package setup tasks: importing version info, reading a local README file, and calling setup() with metadata. It uses common patterns like try-except for importing setuptools. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or external data processing is present. The code is clear, well-structured, and free of anomalies or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
