  "purpose": "Setup script for the fuzzywuzzy Python package, used to define package metadata and dependencies for installation.",
  "sources": "Reading version from __version__, reading long_description from README.rst, importing from fuzzywuzzy and os modules, importing setup from setuptools or distutils.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data is sent externally or executed dynamically.",
  "flows": "Version and description are read from modules and files, then used in setup() to configure package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard setup script. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors. Use of open() to read a README file is typical, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Python setup configuration. It reads version info and long description from files and modules, then calls setup() with package info. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, or suspicious network activity. No indicators of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
