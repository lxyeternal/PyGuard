  "purpose": "Setup configuration script for the 'fuzzywuzzy' Python package, primarily used to define package metadata and dependencies for installation.",
  "sources": "Reads the version from the 'fuzzywuzzy' module, reads 'README.rst' for long description, reads environment and filesystem during setup execution.",
  "sinks": "Potentially reads environment variables indirectly via 'open_file' (if filename was dynamic), but in this static code, no untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Reads version from module to set package version, reads README file for description, and executes setup() to install package.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded credentials, no code injection, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious data flow. Uses standard setup pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package. It imports version info, reads a README file for description, and configures package metadata and dependencies. No external input handling beyond reading local files. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign setup configuration for the 'fuzzywuzzy' package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
