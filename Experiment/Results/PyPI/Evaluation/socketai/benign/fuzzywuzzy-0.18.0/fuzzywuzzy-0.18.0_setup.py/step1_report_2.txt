{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'fuzzywuzzy' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the version from the package (__version__), reads 'README.rst' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that execute untrusted data or perform unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "Reads version info and README file content; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; standard setup script structure.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical package setup operations, importing version info, reading a README file, and configuring package metadata. No user input, network operations, or code execution is present. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. The use of 'os.path' and file reading is standard and safe. The 'try-except' for 'setuptools' is common for compatibility.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
