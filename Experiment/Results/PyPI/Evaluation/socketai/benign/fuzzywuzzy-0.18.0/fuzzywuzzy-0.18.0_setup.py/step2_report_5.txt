  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script for the 'fuzzywuzzy' package.\n- No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or external input handling is present.\n- The code reads version info from the package and a README file, then calls setup() with metadata and dependencies.\n- No external data sinks, network activity, or code injection is detected.\n- The use of try-except for importing setuptools is standard practice.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code reads the version from the `__version__` variable in the package, which is typical.\n- The `long_description` is read from 'README.rst', a local file, with no external input.\n- No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code are present.\n- The code does not perform any dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing beyond local file reads.\n- The overall structure and logic are standard for a Python package setup script.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; no malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the benign nature.\n\n**Any discrepancies or points to challenge?**\n- None. The assessments are consistent and accurate.\n\n**My own estimate after review:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a typical, benign setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and consistent with the code analysis.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- No changes needed to the scores.\n- Confirm that the code remains unaltered and that no external inputs are introduced in future versions.",
