  "purpose": "This code provides utility methods for processing strings, including replacing non-letter/number characters with whitespace and converting case.",
  "sources": "The input string parameter in replace_non_letters_non_numbers_with_whitespace method.",
  "sinks": "The return value of replace_non_letters_non_numbers_with_whitespace, which outputs a processed string.",
  "flows": "Input string -> regex substitution -> output string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. Use of sys.version_info for Python version detection is standard. No suspicious dynamic execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a regex pattern for non-word characters and provides methods to replace such characters with a space, as well as static methods for string stripping and case conversion. There are no external data inputs other than the provided string parameter. The use of sys.version_info is a common approach for version checks, and no malicious or suspicious operations are evident. The code appears straightforward and intended for string normalization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility class for string processing with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs typical string manipulation tasks safely.",
