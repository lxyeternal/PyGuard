{
  "purpose": "This code provides a utility class for processing strings, including replacing non-letter/number characters with whitespace and converting case, primarily for normalization purposes.",
  "sources": "The regex pattern `r\"(?ui)\\W\"` used in `replace_non_letters_non_numbers_with_whitespace` to identify non-word characters.",
  "sinks": "The method `replace_non_letters_non_numbers_with_whitespace` which modifies the input string; no external sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input string -> regex substitution -> output string; static methods operate directly on provided strings without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code uses standard regex and string methods without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class `StringProcessor` with methods to normalize strings by replacing non-word characters with spaces and converting case. The regex `(?ui)\\W` matches non-word characters with Unicode support, which is standard for text normalization. Static methods for string strip, lower, and upper are simple wrappers. No external data access, network activity, or malicious code is present. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and benign. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately set to 0, with high confidence, reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, utility string processing class with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current scores are accurate and should be maintained.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
