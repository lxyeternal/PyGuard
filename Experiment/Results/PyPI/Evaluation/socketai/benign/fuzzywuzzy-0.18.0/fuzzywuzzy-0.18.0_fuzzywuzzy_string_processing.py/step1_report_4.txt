{
  "purpose": "Provides utility methods for processing strings, including replacing non-alphanumeric characters with whitespace and changing case.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info (reads Python version), re.compile (compiles regex pattern), class attribute regex (compiles regex), static methods and class methods (operate on input strings).",
  "sinks": "None directly related to untrusted data or external effects; no network, file, or environment variable interactions.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed by replace_non_letters_non_numbers_with_whitespace which uses the compiled regex to substitute characters. Static methods convert string case and strip whitespace.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The regex is straightforward and not obfuscated. No dynamic code execution or external calls.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a string processing class that uses a regex to replace non-letter/number characters with spaces. It conditionally assigns string to str in Python 3 for compatibility. The class methods perform common string transformations without external data, network, or system calls. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code appears to be standard utility functions with proper practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign utility for string processing with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
