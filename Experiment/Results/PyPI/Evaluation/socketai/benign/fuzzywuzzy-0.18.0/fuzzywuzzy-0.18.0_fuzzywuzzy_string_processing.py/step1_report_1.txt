  "purpose": "Defines a StringProcessor class for string manipulation, including replacing non-letter/number characters with whitespace and case conversions.",
  "sources": "Input string parameter 'a_string' in replace_non_letters_non_numbers_with_whitespace method.",
  "sinks": "Return statement that outputs the processed string after regex substitution.",
  "flows": "Input string -> regex substitution -> output string.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a regex to replace non-word characters; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a class with methods for string processing, primarily replacing non-alphanumeric characters with whitespace, and case conversion utilities. The regex is compiled for efficiency. The class uses standard string functions and basic regex, with no external data access, network communication, or data exfiltration. There are no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated or malicious code, and no suspicious behavior. Overall, the code is straightforward and intended for string normalization, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign string processing utility with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs simple text transformations without any suspicious or harmful operations.",
