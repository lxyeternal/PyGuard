{
  "purpose": "A wrapper class around the Levenshtein library to compare string similarity and differences, similar to SequenceMatcher.",
  "sources": "Reads input sequences via constructor and set methods (_str1, _str2). Uses functions from the Levenshtein library (opcodes, editops, matching_blocks, ratio, distance).",
  "sinks": "None apparent. No untrusted data output or network activity. No use of dangerous system functions or system calls.",
  "flows": "Input sequences are set via constructor or setters. Computed similarity metrics (ratio, distance) are returned. No untrusted data flows to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors observed. The isjunk parameter is acknowledged but not implemented, with a warning, which is benign. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward wrapper for the Levenshtein library, providing string comparison functionalities. It caches results for efficiency. Uses standard Python warnings for unimplemented features. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or suspicious data handling is present. The code relies on an external well-known library without suspicious modifications. No anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility class for string similarity measurement. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks based on the provided code. It is a standard implementation with no signs of supply chain sabotage or malicious intent.",
