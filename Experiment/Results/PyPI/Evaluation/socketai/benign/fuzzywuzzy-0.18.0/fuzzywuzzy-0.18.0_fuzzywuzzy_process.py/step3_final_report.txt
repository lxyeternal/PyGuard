{
  "purpose": "Provides fuzzy matching, scoring, and deduplication functions for string similarity comparison and data cleaning.",
  "sources": "In-memory data processing; no external data sources or system calls.",
  "sinks": "None; operates entirely within memory without external data leaks or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Data flows through in-memory functions, with no external system or network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard fuzzy matching and deduplication routines relying on external modules 'fuzz' and 'utils'. It performs data processing in-memory, with appropriate error handling and no external system calls. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scoring reflects the benign nature, with malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk scores justified by the code's simplicity and safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured fuzzy matching utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
