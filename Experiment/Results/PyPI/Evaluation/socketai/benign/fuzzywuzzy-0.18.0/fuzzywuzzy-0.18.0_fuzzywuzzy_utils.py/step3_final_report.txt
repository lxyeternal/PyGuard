  "purpose": "Utility functions for string validation, ASCII filtering, and normalization to process and sanitize input strings.",
  "sources": "Input strings passed to functions like asciionly, asciidammit, and full_process.",
  "sinks": "Processed strings returned by functions; no external data sinks or system interactions observed.",
  "flows": "Input strings are sanitized and normalized through functions, with potential flow from raw input to sanitized output.",
  "anomalies": "Use of extended ASCII range (128-255) in 'bad_chars' for ASCII filtering; potential for obfuscation but standard sanitization.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard string validation, ASCII filtering, and normalization routines. No external system calls, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. The ASCII filtering using 'bad_chars' (characters 128-255) is a common sanitization technique, though it could be misused for obfuscation. The functions are straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious code detected. The scoring in the reports aligns with the benign nature of the code, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low risk scores (~0.1-0.2). The confidence in benignity is high, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for string processing with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
