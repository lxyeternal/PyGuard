{
  "purpose": "A standard async context manager stack for managing multiple context managers and callbacks, both synchronous and asynchronous.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the parameters of methods such as push, enter_context, push_async_exit, and register callbacks; no external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "Potential sink points include execution of callbacks and context managers, which could process untrusted data if callbacks are malicious.",
  "flows": "Callbacks and context managers are registered via push methods; during __aexit__, these callbacks are invoked in LIFO order, either synchronously or asynchronously, with potential for malicious code execution if callbacks are malicious.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected. Use of MethodType for wrapping methods is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a robust async context management utility, allowing dynamic registration of context managers and callbacks. It handles exception propagation and suppression correctly. No embedded malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The primary security concern is external registration of malicious callbacks, which could execute harmful actions during cleanup. The code itself is standard and safe, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The potential risk is low and primarily depends on external usage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured async context manager stack with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The main security consideration is the trustworthiness of externally registered callbacks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2).",
