  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script configuring package metadata and reading static files for description.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst' and 'HISTORY.rst' files for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Static file reads during setup; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward configuration with no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script using setuptools, with static reads and metadata definitions. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated patterns are present. All signals indicate benign, standard packaging code. No hardcoded secrets, malicious behavior, or vulnerabilities are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard Python setup configuration with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature. The slight overestimation of security risk (0.1) in one report is unnecessary; a score of 0 is more accurate.",
