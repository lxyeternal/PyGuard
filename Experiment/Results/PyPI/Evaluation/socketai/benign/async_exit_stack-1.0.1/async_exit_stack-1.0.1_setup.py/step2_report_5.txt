  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no dynamic code, network calls, or user input handling.\n- The code reads static files ('README.rst' and 'HISTORY.rst') for the long description.\n- No untrusted data sources, sinks, or flows are identified.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The lists for requirements are empty, indicating no external dependencies are installed dynamically.\n- The code adheres to common packaging practices and contains no signs of malware or malicious behavior.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n- **Presence of malicious code or backdoors:** None detected. The code is purely configuration for packaging.\n- **Obfuscation or hardcoded secrets:** None observed.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None, as the script does not perform any risky operations.\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign a score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- **Security risk scores:** Also zero or very low, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Any inconsistencies?**\n\n- The only minor discrepancy is in report 4, which assigns a securityRisk score of 0.1. Given the code's benign nature, this is likely an overestimation. A score of 0 is more appropriate.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (more appropriate than 0.1 in report 4)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe provided setup script is a standard, safe, and benign package configuration. No security issues, malware, or obfuscation are present. The reports are consistent in their assessments, with only a minor overestimation in one report regarding the security risk score.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the nature of the code.",
