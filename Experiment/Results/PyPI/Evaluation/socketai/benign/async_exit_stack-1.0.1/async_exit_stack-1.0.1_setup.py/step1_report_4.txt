  "purpose": "This script is for setting up and configuring a Python package named 'async_exit_stack' for distribution, including reading metadata files and specifying dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads README.rst and HISTORY.rst files for long description content",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no user input or external data processed dynamically",
  "flows": "Reads static files, assigns configuration parameters, and calls setup() with predefined values",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; code appears to be a standard setup script without obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools, reads package description files, and defines package metadata and requirements, then calls setup() to prepare the package. No dynamic code execution, no external data handling beyond reading static files, and no suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
