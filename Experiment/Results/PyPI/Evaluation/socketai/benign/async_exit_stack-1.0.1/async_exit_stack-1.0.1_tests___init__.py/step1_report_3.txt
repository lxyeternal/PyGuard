  "sources": "No input or data reading in the provided code snippet",
  "sinks": "No data output, network calls, or sensitive data handling",
  "flows": "No data flows present in the snippet",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code content; only a file header comment and a module docstring with no executable code",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a UTF-8 encoding declaration, a module docstring indicating it is a unit test package for 'async_exit_stack', and a comment. There are no functions, classes, data processing, or code execution present. The absence of code means there are no sources, sinks, or flows to analyze. It appears to be an initial placeholder or template file with no malicious content or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple header for a unit test package with no executable code or data handling, presenting no security concerns or malicious behavior.",
