{
  "purpose": "To provide a backport of the AsyncExitStack functionality from the contextlib module, ensuring compatibility across Python versions.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the import statement and from the module's own metadata (__author__, __email__, __version__).",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or execution effects.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves a conditional import based on the availability of AsyncExitStack in the standard library, with no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward and standard for compatibility purposes; no anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The script serves as a compatibility layer, importing AsyncExitStack from the standard library if available, or from a local module otherwise. It includes metadata about the package but does not perform any data processing, network operations, or security-sensitive actions. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. The structure is simple and consistent with common backport modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign compatibility wrapper for AsyncExitStack, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or unusual behavior. Overall, it is safe and serves a utility purpose.",
