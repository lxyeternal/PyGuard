  "purpose": "Provide a compatibility fallback for importing AsyncExitStack in different Python versions.",
  "sources": "Import statement from contextlib or local module _async_exit_stack",
  "sinks": "None; no data or external output involved",
  "flows": "Attempt to import from standard library, fallback to local module if ImportError occurs",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import pattern, no suspicious or unusual code",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, clear compatibility layer that tries to import AsyncExitStack from the standard library, falling back to a local module if necessary. It includes static metadata and exports the class. No data handling, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are present. All reports agree on its benign nature, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns detected. The code's simplicity and purpose are transparent, and the fallback module's content is unknown but presumed safe. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's behavior and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard compatibility shim with no malicious intent or security issues. All evidence and reports support this assessment, and the current scores are appropriate.",
