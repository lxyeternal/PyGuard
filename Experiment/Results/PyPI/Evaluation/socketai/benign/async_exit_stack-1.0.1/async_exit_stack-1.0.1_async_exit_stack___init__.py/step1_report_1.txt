{
  "purpose": "Provides a backport of the AsyncExitStack functionality for Python versions lacking native support.",
  "sources": "Imports AsyncExitStack from contextlib or local module _async_exit_stack.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points detected.",
  "flows": "Import statement flow from standard library or local module, with no data transfer to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The code is straightforward and standard for a backport module.",
  "analysis": "The code checks for the availability of AsyncExitStack in the standard library and falls back to a local implementation if needed. It sets module metadata and exports the AsyncExitStack class. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors. The structure is minimal and typical for a compatibility shim.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard compatibility module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
