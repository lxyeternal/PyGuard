  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward, standard compatibility shim for `AsyncExitStack`.\n- No untrusted data handling, network activity, or external data sinks are present.\n- The code is minimal, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious patterns, or suspicious constructs.\n- The purpose is clearly to provide a fallback import for compatibility across Python versions.\n\n**Specific review of the code:**\n```python\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n\n\"\"\"Top-level package for AsyncExitStack backport.\"\"\"\n\n__author__ = \"\"\"Davide Rizzo\"\"\"\n__email__ = 'sorcio@gmail.com'\n__version__ = '1.0.1'\n\ntry:\n    from contextlib import AsyncExitStack\nexcept ImportError:\n    from ._async_exit_stack import AsyncExitStack\n\n__all__ = ['AsyncExitStack']\n```\n\n- The code only attempts to import `AsyncExitStack` from the standard library, falling back to a local module if needed.\n- No data processing, no network activity, no user input, no secrets.\n- Metadata is static and non-sensitive.\n- The fallback module `_async_exit_stack` is not included here, but assuming it’s a local implementation, it’s likely also benign.\n\n**Scores and reasoning:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 in all reports. This is correct; there's no indication of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0. All reports agree the code is straightforward and clear.\n- **Risk:** 0. The code serves a utility purpose with no security implications.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- The reports are consistent and thorough, and no anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.\n- The only point to consider is whether the fallback module `_async_exit_stack` might contain malicious code. However, based on the provided code and reports, there's no evidence to suggest that.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a benign, standard compatibility layer.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and justified.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Final note:** All evidence points to a safe, well-implemented compatibility module with no security risks.",
