{
  "purpose": "Provide a backport of the AsyncExitStack class for compatibility with older Python versions.",
  "sources": "The code reads static metadata (__author__, __email__, __version__) and attempts to import AsyncExitStack from contextlib or a local module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data output observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; only conditional import based on environment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and contains no suspicious patterns or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple package initializer that attempts to import a feature from the standard library, falling back to a local module if necessary. It contains metadata declarations, standard try-except import handling, and an __all__ declaration for exports. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. No network activity, data leakage, or code injection observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign package stub for providing a backport of AsyncExitStack. It contains no malicious intent or security risks.",
