{
  "purpose": "Implementation of a coroutine-based signal class inheriting from FrozenList, allowing connection of callbacks and asynchronous dispatching.",
  "sources": "The class reads the 'owner' attribute during initialization; the 'send' method reads the list of receivers; external receivers are invoked during 'send'.",
  "sinks": "The 'send' method awaits receiver functions; no other untrusted data sources are evident.",
  "flows": "Receivers are called via 'await receiver(*args, **kwargs)' during 'send' when the signal is frozen.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward. Potential minor concern: no validation of receiver callables, assuming all are coroutines.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Signal class extending FrozenList, with methods for initialization, representation, and asynchronous sending. It enforces that signals are only sent when frozen, raising RuntimeError otherwise. Receivers are invoked asynchronously, assuming they are coroutines. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code is simple and clear, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns. The lack of receiver validation could lead to runtime errors if non-coroutine functions are added, but this is a usage consideration rather than a security flaw.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears secure, well-structured, and free from malicious intent. The empty reports lack specific findings, so based on the code alone, the malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1). There are no apparent vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors. Overall, the implementation is safe, with minor considerations regarding receiver validation.",
