  "purpose": "The code appears to be a benign utility or setup script with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables, imports modules, or processes data, but no untrusted input sources are explicitly identified.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data leaks, network transmissions, or system modifications are evident from the provided snippets.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or inputs through processing functions to outputs or logs, with no evidence of malicious data exfiltration or command execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code constructs are present; code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets are minimal and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The lack of suspicious data flows or system modifications supports a benign assessment. Confidence is high that the code is safe, with no malicious intent or supply chain compromise evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity. The low security risk score (0.2) is justified, and the malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0. Overall, the code poses minimal security concern.",
