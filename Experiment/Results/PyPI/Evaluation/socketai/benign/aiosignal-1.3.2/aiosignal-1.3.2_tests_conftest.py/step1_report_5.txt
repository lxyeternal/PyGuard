  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script that performs some data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Reads input from command-line arguments, environment variables, and possibly from network sources or files.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to console, files, or network connections; uses subprocesses or system calls.",
  "flows": "Input data from sources is processed and then sent to sinks via function calls, network, or file writes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network addresses, or unusual code constructs detected. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is structured with typical data input and output operations. No malicious or suspicious patterns like data exfiltration, backdoors, or system damage routines are present. Usage of third-party libraries is standard and without suspicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets or unusual control flows are evident. The code's purpose appears legitimate, and no anomalies or malicious indicators are detected based on the provided content.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard utility script with no indicators of supply chain sabotage or malware.",
