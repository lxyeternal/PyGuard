  "purpose": "To configure and run the setup process for a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's __name__ variable and executes the setup() function.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function, which handles package installation procedures.",
  "flows": "The script checks if __name__ == '__main__' and then calls setup(), which is a controlled process.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or unusual behaviors detected. The code is minimal and standard for packaging.",
  "analysis": "This is a straightforward setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It performs a common pattern: if executed as a script, it runs setup(). There are no suspicious imports, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors. The setup() call is typically used to configure package metadata, dependencies, and installation options, which are not shown here. The code does not perform any network activity, data handling, or potentially harmful operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
