  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only imports a library and executes a setup() function.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could cause data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving external inputs or untrusted sources; the setup() call is standard for packaging.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and does not contain any suspicious constructs, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the setuptools library and calls setup() within the main guard. It appears to be a typical minimal setup script for packaging Python modules. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present. No data is read, written, or transmitted. The structure is simple and adheres to common packaging conventions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
