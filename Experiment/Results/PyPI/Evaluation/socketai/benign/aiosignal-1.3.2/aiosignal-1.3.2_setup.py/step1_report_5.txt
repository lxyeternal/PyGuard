{
  "purpose": "To facilitate the installation and distribution of a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading; only the setup() function is invoked.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function does not handle untrusted data or perform any data leaks; it only executes package setup procedures.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code merely calls setup() when executed as main.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and calls setup() within a main guard, which is standard for packaging scripts. No external input handling, no data exfiltration, no network activity, or malicious code included. The simplicity and conventional pattern suggest this is a typical setup script with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
