{
  "purpose": "The code is used to set up and install a Python package via setuptools.",
  "sources": "The import statement for setuptools and the call to setup() in the main block.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function could potentially process package metadata, but in this context, it doesn't perform any direct data output or network activity.",
  "flows": "Import of setuptools (source), execution of setup() (sink), which could process package data but not inherently malicious.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The setup() call is standard for packaging.",
  "analysis": "The script is a minimal setup script common in Python packaging. It imports setuptools and calls setup() within a main guard. There are no suspicious operations, no code injection, or malicious logic present. No external data input, network activity, or secret handling occurs. The code appears to be a typical, benign package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign Python setup script with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
