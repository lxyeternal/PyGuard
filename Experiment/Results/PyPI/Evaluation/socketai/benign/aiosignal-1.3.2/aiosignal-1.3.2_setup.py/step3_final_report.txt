  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script that initializes package installation.",
  "sources": "Import of 'setup' from setuptools, executed within the '__main__' guard.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no data leaks or malicious data handling.",
  "flows": "Import of 'setup' (source) directly leads to execution of setup() (sink) without data manipulation or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; the code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a canonical minimal setup script: it imports 'setup' from setuptools and calls it within the main guard. There are no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no obfuscation. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the benign and standard nature of this code. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code relies on external configuration files for metadata, which is typical and not suspicious. Overall, the code is safe, and the assessments are accurate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
