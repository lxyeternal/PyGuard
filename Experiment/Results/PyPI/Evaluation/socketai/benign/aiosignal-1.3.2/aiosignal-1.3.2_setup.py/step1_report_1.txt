  "purpose": "The code is used to set up and install a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The 'setup()' function from setuptools is called, which reads package metadata (not shown here) and configuration data possibly from other files or parameters if provided.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted input or data in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the setup() function is called directly without processing external untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and follows standard package setup practices. No anomalies or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'setup' function from setuptools and invokes it within the main block. It performs a typical package setup call without any additional logic or dynamic code execution. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. It is a standard setup script used in Python packaging.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard setup script for Python packaging. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
