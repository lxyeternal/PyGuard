      "conclusion": "The code appears secure, well-structured, and free from malicious intent. The empty reports lack specific findings, so based on the code alone, the malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1). There are no apparent vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors. Overall, the implementation is safe, with minor considerations regarding receiver validation."
