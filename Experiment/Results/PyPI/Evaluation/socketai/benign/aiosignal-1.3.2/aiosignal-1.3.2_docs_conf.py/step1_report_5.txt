  "purpose": "Configuration script for building documentation using Sphinx for the 'aiosignal' project.",
  "sources": "Reads project version from 'aiosignal/__init__.py'; loads extensions and configuration settings from hardcoded lists and dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data; the script mainly reads files and sets configuration variables.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from source file -> sets configuration parameters -> generates documentation; no untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The only file I/O occurs to read the version string from a specific module; no suspicious or obfuscated code patterns detected. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or network activities are present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily serves to configure documentation generation via Sphinx. It reads the version from a specific Python file using a regex search, which is a standard approach. Extensions are added based on import success, with no dynamic or external code execution beyond normal import attempts. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. All code appears to be standard configuration with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file with no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It performs file reading and sets configuration parameters in a typical manner for documentation builds.",
