  "purpose": "Configuration script for building documentation using Sphinx for the aiosignal project.",
  "sources": "Reading the __init__.py file to extract version info, importing modules for documentation extensions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external network communications present.",
  "flows": "Reading version info from __init__.py file without executing or injecting code, no data flows leading to untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() with encoding='latin1' for reading version file; no suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets. No code execution or external communications observed. Extensions are standard or optional, with a fallback if optional imports fail.",
  "analysis": "The script reads version information from a specific __init__.py file using a regex search, which is a common and safe operation. No untrusted input sources or user data inputs are present. Import statements are safe and only import necessary modules for documentation. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or credential handling. No obfuscation or hidden code patterns. The code's purpose is solely to configure documentation build settings, with no malicious intent evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration script for documentation generation, with no malicious behavior, supply chain risks, or security threats detected.",
