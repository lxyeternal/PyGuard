  "purpose": "The script configures Sphinx documentation for the 'aiosignal' project, specifying extensions, theme options, and project metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads the '__version__' variable from 'aiosignal/__init__.py' using file I/O and regular expressions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network, file writes, or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from a source file; no data flows to potentially dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The only notable operation is reading a version string from a file with regex parsing. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code are present. The code is purely configuration with no dynamic execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script performs static configuration for documentation generation, importing modules, setting extensions, and reading the package version. The version is extracted via regex from a source file, which is standard practice. No external inputs, network calls, or executable code sequences are present. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It only reads the version info from the package's '__init__.py' file and sets up documentation parameters. There are no indicators of malware, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
