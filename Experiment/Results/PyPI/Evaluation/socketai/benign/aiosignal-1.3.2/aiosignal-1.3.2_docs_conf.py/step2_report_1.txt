  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to verify the presence of issues, the logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Summary of all reports:**\n- All reports describe the script as a standard Sphinx configuration file.\n- The script reads version info from `aiosignal/__init__.py` using regex.\n- No external network activity, code execution, or handling of untrusted input beyond file reading.\n- Optional extensions are imported safely with try-except.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code.\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, with high confidence.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence:** The code matches the description; it reads version info, sets up Sphinx configs, and attempts optional extensions.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n- **Anomalies:** Only file I/O for version extraction, which is standard.\n- **Data flows:** Static configuration with no dynamic or untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation patterns detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, all justified given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical review:\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  Yes. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly 0. The risk score is also 0, as there's no security concern.\n\n- **Any overlooked issues?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward, standard for documentation configuration, with no suspicious operations.\n\n- **Potential assumptions?**  \n  All assumptions are valid; the code is static, safe, and intended solely for configuration.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk detected)\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is a benign, standard Sphinx configuration script with no supply chain or security issues.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the scores assigned in the reports.",
