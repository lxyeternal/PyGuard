  "purpose": "This script configures the Sphinx documentation build for the 'aiosignal' project, setting extensions, themes, and reading version info from the source.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from 'aiosignal/__init__.py' using regex; importing modules; setting configuration variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network activity; no code execution beyond static imports; reading from a local file.",
  "flows": "Static file read of version info; configuration variables set directly; optional extension import.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard file I/O; safe optional import with try-except.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Sphinx configuration script. It reads version info from a source file using regex, sets up extensions and themes, and handles optional imports safely. There are no dynamic or untrusted data flows, no network activity, and no obfuscation or malicious code. The regex and file reading are standard practices, and the optional extension import is wrapped in try-except, indicating safe handling. No secrets, credentials, or obfuscation patterns are present. The script's purpose is solely to configure documentation, with no security or malicious concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard configuration script for Sphinx documentation. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and justified.",
