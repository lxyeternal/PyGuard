While its capabilities could be misused if altered, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage in this snippet. The security risk is low, and the malware and obfuscation scores are justified as zero. The overall security assessment indicates a safe and well-structured component."

The use of import hooks and redaction is standard for instrumentation frameworks. The security risk is low, primarily related to potential misuse if hooks are replaced maliciously, but in its current form, it is safe."

The use of a function attribute for registration is standard practice. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware score should be 0. The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is clear. The risk score can be considered very low (~0.1) due to the print statement, but overall, the code poses no security threat."
