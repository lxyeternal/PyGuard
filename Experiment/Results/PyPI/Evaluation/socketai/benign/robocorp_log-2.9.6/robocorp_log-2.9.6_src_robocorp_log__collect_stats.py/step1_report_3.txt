{
  "purpose": "A helper module to collect and print statistical data, likely for monitoring or analytics.",
  "sources": "Input data is not explicitly read; the code maintains internal state via the 'stats' dictionary. No external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "Output is printed to standard output via 'print' in the 'print_stats' function. The 'json.dumps' output could be considered a sink for data presentation.",
  "flows": "The 'inc_stats' function updates 'stats' and registers 'print_stats' to execute at program exit. When 'print_stats' is called, it outputs the current 'stats' dictionary in JSON format.",
  "anomalies": "The use of a function attribute 'registered' for one-time registration of an 'atexit' callback is unconventional but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple statistics collector that increments counters by name. It sets up an 'atexit' handler to print the statistics when the program terminates. The registration mechanism uses a function attribute to ensure 'print_stats' is registered only once. No external data sources, untrusted input, or suspicious operations are evident. The module's behavior appears straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign statistics collection utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply maintains counters and prints them at program exit. No malicious intent or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
