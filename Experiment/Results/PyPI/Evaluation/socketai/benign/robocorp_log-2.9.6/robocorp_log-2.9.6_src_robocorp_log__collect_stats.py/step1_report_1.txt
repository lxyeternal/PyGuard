  "purpose": "A helper module to collect and display statistics data.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; only maintains an internal dictionary 'stats'.",
  "sinks": "The 'print_stats' function outputs data to standard output (console).",
  "flows": "The 'inc_stats' function updates the 'stats' dictionary, which can then be printed by 'print_stats'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'atexit' to automatically print stats is normal; no suspicious or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple statistics collection utility. It maintains an internal dictionary 'stats' that counts occurrences of 'name' via 'inc_stats'. The registration of 'print_stats' at exit ensures stats are printed at program termination. The registration logic dynamically sets an attribute 'registered' on the function object to prevent multiple registrations, which is a standard Python pattern. There is no indication of data leakage, malicious network activity, or backdoors. No use of untrusted inputs, external data sources, or insecure operations is present. The code structure and logic are straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign statistics utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply tracks and displays counters in a program lifecycle. No malware or security concerns are evident.",
