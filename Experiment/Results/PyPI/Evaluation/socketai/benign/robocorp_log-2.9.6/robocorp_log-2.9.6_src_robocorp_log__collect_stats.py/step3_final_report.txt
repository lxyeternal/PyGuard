  "purpose": "A helper module to collect statistics.",
  "sources": "Function parameter 'name' in inc_stats, which is used to update the stats dictionary.",
  "sinks": "print statement in print_stats outputs the stats dictionary as JSON to stdout.",
  "flows": "inc_stats reads 'name' and updates stats; print_stats reads stats and outputs it.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a function attribute 'registered' to ensure single registration of print_stats; unconventional but benign.",
  "analysis": "The code maintains a global stats dictionary, increments counters via inc_stats, and registers print_stats to run at program exit. No external inputs, network activity, or malicious code are present. The use of a function attribute 'registered' to prevent multiple registrations is a standard pattern, albeit slightly unconventional. The print output is benign, serving as a utility. No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward and intended for internal statistics collection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward statistics utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The use of a function attribute for registration is standard practice. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware score should be 0. The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is clear. The risk score can be considered very low (~0.1) due to the print statement, but overall, the code poses no security threat.",
