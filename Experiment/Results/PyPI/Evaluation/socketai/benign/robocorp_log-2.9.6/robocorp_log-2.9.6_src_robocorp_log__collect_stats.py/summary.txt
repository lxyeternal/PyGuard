  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward statistics utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The use of a function attribute for registration is standard practice. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware score should be 0. The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is clear. The risk score can be considered very low (~0.1) due to the print statement, but overall, the code poses no security threat."
