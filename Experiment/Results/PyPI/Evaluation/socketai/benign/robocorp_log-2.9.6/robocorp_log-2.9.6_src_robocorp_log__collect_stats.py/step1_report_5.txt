{
  "purpose": "A helper module to collect and print statistical data, likely for monitoring or debugging purposes.",
  "sources": "The 'stats' dictionary and the 'inc_stats' function which updates it; the 'atexit.register' call which registers 'print_stats' for execution upon program termination.",
  "sinks": "The 'print_stats' function outputs data to standard output, which is generally safe; no untrusted data sources are directly used for critical operations.",
  "flows": "The 'inc_stats' function updates the 'stats' dictionary, and upon first call, registers 'print_stats' to execute at exit; 'print_stats' serializes and prints the 'stats' dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically registers an exit handler on first use, which is not unusual but slightly dynamic; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The module defines a simple statistical collector, initializing a 'stats' dictionary. The 'inc_stats' function registers an 'atexit' handler only once, at first invocation, to print the collected stats in JSON format. This approach is straightforward and intended for monitoring, with no signs of malicious behavior. No obfuscated code, external data sources, or dangerous operations are present. The only notable aspect is dynamic registration of the exit handler, which is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a benign statistics collector with no malicious intent or security risks. It registers a cleanup function to output stats at program exit, which is typical for monitoring purposes.",
