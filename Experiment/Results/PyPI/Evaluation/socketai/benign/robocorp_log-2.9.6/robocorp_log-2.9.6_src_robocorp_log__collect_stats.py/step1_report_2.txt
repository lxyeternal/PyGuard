{
  "purpose": "A helper module to collect and print statistics.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters (inc_stats). No external input sources are directly used.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs data via print in print_stats, which could potentially leak data if used maliciously, but this appears intended.",
  "flows": "inc_stats updates the stats dictionary; print_stats outputs the stats as JSON.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic attribute assignment to register atexit callback; no suspicious or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple statistics collection mechanism with functions to increment counters and print the results at program exit. It dynamically registers a print function only once, via an attribute check. No external inputs, environment variables, or sensitive data handling observed. No obfuscated code or malicious constructs detected. The code appears benign and intended solely for internal statistics gathering.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a straightforward statistics helper with no evidence of malicious behavior. It safely collects and prints data at exit, with no suspicious activities or security risks identified.",
