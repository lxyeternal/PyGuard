{
  "purpose": "Define a tuple of string constants representing unscoped elements or keywords.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines a static tuple variable.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code is only a variable declaration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Tuple type from typing and declares a tuple named UNSCOPED_ELEMENTS containing a set of string constants. There are no data inputs, no dynamic execution, no side effects, and no third-party dependencies. The code appears to be part of a larger context, perhaps used for keyword or token categorization. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign code snippet defining a set of string constants. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code.",
