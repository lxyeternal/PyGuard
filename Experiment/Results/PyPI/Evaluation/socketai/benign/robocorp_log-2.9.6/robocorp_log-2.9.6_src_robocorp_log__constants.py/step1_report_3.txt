  "purpose": "Define a tuple of string constants representing unscoped elements or keywords.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's own string literals, specifically the list of element names assigned to UNSCOPED_ELEMENTS.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks, untrusted input, or external data handling in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code is static and only defines a tuple.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward and well-formed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a typing utility, then defines a tuple containing string constants. There are no dynamic operations, no external input handling, and no potential injection points. It appears to serve as a static reference for certain keywords or labels, likely used elsewhere in the project. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple static data definition with no malicious activity or security concerns. It does not involve any unsafe operations, external data handling, or obfuscation.",
