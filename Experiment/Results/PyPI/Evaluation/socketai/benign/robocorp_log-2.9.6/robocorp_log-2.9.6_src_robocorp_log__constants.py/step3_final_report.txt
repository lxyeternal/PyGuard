  "purpose": "Define a tuple of string constants likely used as identifiers or keywords within a larger codebase.",
  "sources": "Static declaration of the tuple UNSCOPED_ELEMENTS; no external data or input sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code does not process external input or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only declares a static constant tuple.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple static declaration of a tuple containing string constants. All reports agree that it is benign, with no dynamic behavior, input/output, or external dependencies. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent and appropriate. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose appears to be for internal categorization or keyword recognition, with no indication of malicious intent or security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious or obfuscated behavior. The existing reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
