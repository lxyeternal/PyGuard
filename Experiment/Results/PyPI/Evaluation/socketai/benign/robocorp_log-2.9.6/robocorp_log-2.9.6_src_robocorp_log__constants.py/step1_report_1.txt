  "purpose": "Define a tuple containing a set of string constants, likely used as identifiers or labels within a larger codebase.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources present in this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs, no untrusted data handling, or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths, as the code only defines a constant tuple without processing or data transfer.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward declaration of a tuple named UNSCOPED_ELEMENTS containing predefined string constants. It does not process input, perform network operations, or manipulate data in any insecure manner. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign declaration of constants with no malicious behavior or security concerns identified. It appears to serve as part of a larger program or module.",
