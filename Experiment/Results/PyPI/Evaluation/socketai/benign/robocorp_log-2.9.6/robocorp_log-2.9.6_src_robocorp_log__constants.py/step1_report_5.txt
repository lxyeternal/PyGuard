  "purpose": "Define a tuple of string constants likely used as identifiers or keywords in a larger codebase.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string literals assigned to the UNSCOPED_ELEMENTS tuple.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines a constant.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behaviors; the code is a simple data structure declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Tuple from typing and defines a tuple of strings named UNSCOPED_ELEMENTS. There are no input reads, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns. The strings appear to be language or compiler keywords, possibly used for code analysis or parsing. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious intent are present. The code's simplicity and static nature do not suggest obfuscation or malware.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a benign declaration of string constants, likely used for internal purposes such as keyword recognition or filtering. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected.",
