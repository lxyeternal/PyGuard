{
  "purpose": "Define a tuple of string constants related to code control flow or debug elements.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leak points present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths; the code only declares a constant.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code declares a tuple of string literals named UNSCOPED_ELEMENTS, likely for use elsewhere in the project. It contains typical control flow or debug-related keywords. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, and no hardcoded credentials or malicious indicators. The code is straightforward, simple, and does not perform any actions beyond defining a constant.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign declaration of string constants with no malicious behavior, no security risks, and no obfuscation. It appears to be part of a larger project without any suspicious intent.",
