  "purpose": "This code implements a cross-platform console color management utility supporting ANSI escape sequences and Windows API calls, allowing setting and resetting terminal text colors via context managers.",
  "sources": "Reads from sys.stdout and sys.stdout.buffer, as well as environment variables and global constants for color modes.",
  "sinks": "Writes escape sequences to sys.stdout or calls Windows API functions to set console text attributes.",
  "flows": "Input commands to set_color or set_mode flow into output functions that modify console appearance, via escape sequences or Windows API calls.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious behavior; exception handling for platform-specific fallback is standard; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured console coloring utility supporting multiple platforms. It uses platform detection, context managers, and fallback mechanisms to ensure compatibility. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Exception handling masks errors but does not conceal malicious intent. The code's purpose is purely aesthetic, enhancing terminal output readability.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, cross-platform console color management utility with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
