  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard setup script, imports, reads README, uses sys.version_info, prints a warning.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The print warning is benign and typical.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — justified.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar setup, reads README, uses sys.version_info, prints warning.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity, just a missing exception handling for open(), which is common in setup scripts. No suspicious code.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 — the risk score might be slightly high considering the benign nature; perhaps 0.1 is more appropriate, but it's not unreasonable.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern, reads README, checks Python version, prints warning.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious code or obfuscation. Standard setup script.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — justified.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, standard setup, no external data manipulation.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity, just a straightforward setup script.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — justified.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern, static data, no external input manipulation.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious code or obfuscation, typical setup script.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 or 0 — given the benign nature, 0 is more appropriate, but 0.1 is acceptable as a conservative estimate.  \n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code presence:** All reports describe a standard setup script with no malicious or obfuscated code.  \n- **Malware:** All scores are 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.  \n- **Obfuscated:** All are 0, no obfuscation detected.  \n- **Risk:** Slightly varied, but generally very low. The only minor point is the open() without exception handling, which is common in setup scripts and not malicious.  \n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Overall malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward and readable.  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 — a very low security risk due to potential runtime error if README.rst is missing, but not a security concern.  \n\n**Note:** No evidence of supply chain attack, malicious payload, or obfuscation. The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, with standard practices and no suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. The code is benign, and the scores are appropriate, with only a very minimal security risk score possibly being slightly conservative.",
