{
  "purpose": "Define a setup configuration for a virtual MySQL package, primarily to inform package managers and users about the dependency.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info.major (to determine Python version), open('README.rst').read() (to read long description), static strings for metadata.",
  "sinks": "The install_requires parameter could potentially be manipulated if the script is modified to accept external input, but in this case, it is static.",
  "flows": "Not applicable: static code with no external data flow beyond reading a local file and using system info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code performs a straightforward setup configuration. The warning print statement is informational, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to set up a Python package with conditional dependencies based on Python version, and reads a README file for description. It outputs a warning message about a virtual package. No dynamic execution, no external input manipulation, and no suspicious code segments are present. The code is typical for a setup script with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard package setup script that conditionally assigns dependencies and outputs an informational warning. No malicious behavior or security issues are identified.",
