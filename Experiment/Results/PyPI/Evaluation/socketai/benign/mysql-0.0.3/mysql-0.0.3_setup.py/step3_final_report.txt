{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a virtual MySQL package, configuring dependencies based on Python version and providing package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst' for long description, checks sys.version_info, and outputs a warning message.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or data exfiltration activities.",
  "flows": "Conditional dependency assignment based on Python version; reading file and printing warning.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'open' without exception handling for reading 'README.rst', but this is typical in setup scripts and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows. The only minor concern is the lack of exception handling for file reading, which does not pose a security risk. No network activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The print warning is informational and harmless.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a safe, straightforward setup configuration for a Python package. All signals indicate no malicious intent or obfuscation. The risk score should be 0, and malware score should be 0, reflecting its benign nature.",
