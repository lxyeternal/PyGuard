{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to set up a Python package, specifically a virtual package for MySQL-python, and provide related metadata for installation.",
  "sources": "Code reads system version info (sys.version_info) and opens 'README.rst' file to read long description.",
  "sinks": "Potential sink is the open('README.rst') call which could read arbitrary files; however, this is standard for setup scripts.",
  "flows": "System version info is used to determine package name; the long description flows from the file read into the setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code structure follows typical setup script patterns. No suspicious dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated parts.",
  "analysis": "The script checks Python version to determine a dependency name, warns the user about the virtual package, and sets up package metadata. It does not include any untrusted input handling beyond standard package setup procedures. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It primarily manages package dependencies and metadata.",
