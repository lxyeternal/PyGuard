  "purpose": "This script configures and builds a Python package with optional C/C++ extension modules, supporting both native and PyPy implementations.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line options, os, platform, and imported modules (ffi_build) for extension configuration",
  "sinks": "imported modules (ffi_build), potential dynamic extension loading, file removal with os.remove",
  "flows": "Command-line options (e.g., --cffi) determine extension configuration; os.remove in my_egg_info runs during setup; import ffi_build dynamically during execution",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import ffi_build without validation; conditional logic based on command-line flags; removal of SOURCES.txt file without checks; no explicit hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns",
  "analysis": "The script primarily configures build options for a Python package, including optional C extensions or ffi-based modules. It uses command-line options to decide build paths, dynamically imports ffi_build, and modifies sys.argv. The extension building process is straightforward and standard for Python C/C++ modules. The removal of SOURCES.txt is a typical workaround. There are no signs of obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The code does not perform network operations, data leaks, or system manipulations. The dynamic import of ffi_build could be scrutinized, but it appears to be part of standard extension building workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for building Python C extensions with conditional support for ffi modules. It does not contain malicious behavior or sabotage indicators. The dynamic import of ffi_build is standard for such build scripts, assuming ffi_build is a legitimate, trusted module. No malicious code, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
