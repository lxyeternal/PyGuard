  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and the described concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script configures and builds a Python package with optional C/C++ extensions, supporting both native and PyPy implementations. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected. The dynamic import of `ffi_build` is standard for CFFI workflows.\n\n- **Code confirmation:** The code does import `ffi_build` dynamically based on options, which is typical. No suspicious activity is evident.\n\n- **Errors or flaws:** The removal of `SOURCES.txt` in `my_egg_info.run()` is a workaround for setuptools issues; not malicious. No validation of `ffi_build` import, but expected in build scripts.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security risk = 0.1 (very low). The low risk score is appropriate given the benign analysis.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment aligns with the code. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing platform-specific compilation and dynamic extension configuration. No malicious activity found.\n\n- **Code confirmation:** The code matches the description. The dynamic import of `ffi_build` and file deletion are standard.\n\n- **Errors or flaws:** No validation of `ffi_build`, but this is typical. The deletion of `SOURCES.txt` is a known workaround.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, security risk = 0.2. Slightly higher but still reasonable, considering the dynamic import.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is accurate. No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script builds a Python package with C extensions, with dynamic `ffi_build` import and file deletion in egg_info. No suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Code confirmation:** Matches the code provided. The dynamic import and file removal are standard.\n\n- **Errors or flaws:** No validation of `ffi_build`, but typical for build scripts.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1. Appropriate.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, standard build script with conditional logic based on command-line args. No malicious activity.\n\n- **Code confirmation:** Consistent with code. No obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n\n- **Errors or flaws:** No validation of `ffi_build`, but acceptable.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1. Reasonable.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script builds extensions conditionally, with dynamic `ffi_build` import and file removal. No malicious behavior.\n\n- **Code confirmation:** Matches the code. The import and file removal are standard in build scripts.\n\n- **Errors or flaws:** No validation of `ffi_build`, but typical.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1. Appropriate.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code. The dynamic import of `ffi_build` is standard for such build scripts, assuming `ffi_build` is a trusted local module.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, correctly identifying no obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Very low across all reports (0.1 or 0.2), reflecting the benign nature of the script. The only minor concern is the dynamic import of an external module, but in build contexts, this is common and expected.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malicious code or backdoors)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, standard build script)\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (minimal, related to dynamic import and file deletion, both standard in build scripts)\n\n**In conclusion,** the reports are accurate, and the code is a typical build setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are justified and should remain as they are.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to dynamic import and filesystem operations, but these are standard in build scripts)\n\n**Work done:** Confirmed consistency, identified no malicious activity, and validated the scoring rationale.",
