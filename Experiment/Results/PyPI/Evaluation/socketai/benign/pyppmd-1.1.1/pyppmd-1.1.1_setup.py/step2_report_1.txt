  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checkting the code, reasoning, and scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the script as a build/setup script for a Python package with optional C or CFFI extensions.\n- The code relies heavily on command-line options, dynamic imports (ffi_build), and filesystem modifications (os.remove).\n- No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks is present.\n- The dynamic import of ffi_build is standard in build workflows but could be risky if ffi_build is compromised—however, it is assumed to be a trusted local module.\n- The removal of SOURCES.txt is a known workaround for setuptools issues, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed review of each report:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Correctly states the script configures and builds extensions, supporting PyPy and native.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity; dynamic import of ffi_build is standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Risk 0.1, Obfuscated 0.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. The low risk score is justified. No changes needed.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on platform-specific build tasks.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior; dynamic import is typical.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Risk 0.2, Obfuscated 0.\n- **Verdict:** Correct. Slightly higher risk score (0.2) is acceptable given the dynamic import, but still minimal.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Again, build configuration for a specific package with C extensions.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity; dynamic import and file deletion are standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Risk 0.1, Obfuscated 0.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No adjustments needed.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to previous, with focus on build customization.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior; dynamic import and file removal are routine.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Risk 0.1, Obfuscated 0.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Standard build setup with conditional extension creation.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity; reliance on trusted ffi_build module.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Risk 0.1, Obfuscated 0.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of scoring consistency:**\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the code's behavior.\n- Risk scores are low (0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal concern mainly due to dynamic import and filesystem modification, which are common in build scripts.\n- Obfuscation scores are 0, as no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are present.\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, well-understood build/setup script.\n- No malicious or obfuscated code detected.\n- Dynamic import of ffi_build is typical for CFFI workflows, assuming the module is trusted.\n- Filesystem modifications are standard workaround steps.\n\n### **My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, mainly due to dynamic import and filesystem modifications, which are common in build scripts)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is benign, with no signs of supply chain compromise or malicious intent. The low risk score is justified, and no changes are necessary.\n\n**Final note:** Always ensure that `ffi_build` is a trusted module, as malicious code in build dependencies could pose a risk, but based on the provided code and context, this is standard practice.",
