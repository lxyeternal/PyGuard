  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured Python extension for PPMd compression with no embedded malware or obfuscation. The callback functions could be exploited if malicious code is supplied, but this is a known and documented risk rather than malicious behavior. Overall, the security risk is low, with a slight increase due to callback flexibility."
