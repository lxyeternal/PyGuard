{
  "purpose": "The code comprises unit tests for the pyppmd library, specifically testing encoding and decoding functions with static data, file-based data, and hash verification to ensure data integrity.",
  "sources": "File reads from static test data files, in-memory data passed to encoder/decoder, and hash functions computing digests for verification.",
  "sinks": "Hash digest comparisons for data integrity; no external network or untrusted data sources involved.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file or in-memory input through encoder/decoder functions, then into hash functions for verification; no external sinks or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, and no external communication or malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward test code for the pyppmd compression library, involving standard file I/O, data encoding/decoding, and hash verification. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The data flows are typical for testing data integrity. The code does not interact with external systems or handle sensitive data beyond hash checks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign, testing nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign test code for a compression library, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
