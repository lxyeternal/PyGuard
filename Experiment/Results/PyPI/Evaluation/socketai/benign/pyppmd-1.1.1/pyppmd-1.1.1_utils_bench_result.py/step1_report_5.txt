  "purpose": "The script generates a markdown or simple text report from JSON benchmark results, including system info and benchmark data.",
  "sources": "Reads input JSON file specified by command-line argument.",
  "sinks": "Outputs the generated report to standard output.",
  "flows": "Reads JSON file -> Parses JSON -> Extracts data -> Generates formatted report -> Prints report.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no network communication, no data leaks, and no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code processes benchmark data and system info from a specified JSON file, formatting it into a markdown or simple table. It uses standard libraries for file handling, JSON parsing, and command-line argument parsing. The code does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or other suspicious activities. No hardcoded secrets or potentially malicious patterns are present. The logic appears straightforward and intended solely for report generation.",
  "conclusion": "This script appears to be a benign report generator with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It solely reads a local JSON file, processes data, and outputs a formatted report without side effects.",
