{
  "purpose": "Python bindings for the PPMd compression library, providing classes and functions for compression and decompression of data using different variants.",
  "sources": "Function arguments for data input, version retrieval, and optional import fallback modules.",
  "sinks": "Encode and decode methods within classes, returning compressed or decompressed data; no external system calls or network activity.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arguments into encoder/decoder objects, through encode/decode methods, and back as output; no external communication or side effects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs; standard import fallback patterns for C/CFFI modules.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured Python wrapper for C/CFFI implementations of PPMd, with proper input validation and no external system interactions. The optional modules are typical for performance optimization and do not introduce malicious behavior. No signs of obfuscation or sabotage are present. The data processing is contained within memory, with no external communication or side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent implementation of Python bindings for the PPMd compression library. There are no indications of malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation. The supply chain security risk is minimal, primarily related to trust in the optional dependencies, which are standard and benign.",
