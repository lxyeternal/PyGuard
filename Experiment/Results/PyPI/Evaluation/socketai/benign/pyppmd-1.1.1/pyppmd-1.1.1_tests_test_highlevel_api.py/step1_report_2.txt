{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to test compression and decompression functions from the pyppmd library using predefined input and output data.",
  "sources": "The source variable containing a string, and the encoded variable containing a byte sequence used as expected output for tests.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include any untrusted input sources; it only uses hardcoded data for testing.",
  "flows": "Data flows from hardcoded source data through compression and decompression functions, with no external or untrusted data involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code patterns, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code performs straightforward tests with fixed data.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the pyppmd library and runs a series of assertions to verify compression and decompression functions using predefined input and output data. There are no external input sources, user inputs, or network operations. The data used for testing appears to be static and hardcoded. The code strictly focuses on validating the library’s functions with known data, with no indication of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple test suite for the pyppmd compression library, using fixed data for validation. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is safe and intended for functionality verification.",
