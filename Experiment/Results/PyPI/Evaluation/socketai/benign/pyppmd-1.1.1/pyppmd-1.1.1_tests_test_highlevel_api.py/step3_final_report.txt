{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a test suite for verifying the correctness of the pyppmd compression and decompression functions using static input data and expected output.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the hardcoded string 'source' and the static byte sequence 'encoded'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data; all data remains in-memory within the test functions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'source' string into 'pyppmd.compress' and from 'encoded' into 'pyppmd.decompress', with assertions verifying the output, all within local scope.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static test suite that verifies compression and decompression functions of the pyppmd library using predefined input and expected output. It involves no external inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The data used is hardcoded, and assertions confirm correctness. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: near 0) are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static test script with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
