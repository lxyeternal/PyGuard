{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates usage of the pyppmd library to compress and decompress a string, primarily for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the variable 'source' as input data for compression and decompression functions.",
  "sinks": "The code does not appear to send or store untrusted data elsewhere; the data flows are contained within in-memory variables.",
  "flows": "Input string 'source' is encoded and compressed; compressed data is then decompressed back to verify correctness.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors detected. The code uses hardcoded encoded data for testing but this is typical for test cases.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a third-party compression library, defines a source string, and tests compression/decompression functions with expected outputs. No external inputs, no network activity, and no dynamic code execution are present. The encoded data appears to be a static expected output for the test cases. There are no suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious actions. The code is straightforward and appears to be a standard test suite for a compression library.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test script for verifying the functionality of the pyppmd compression library. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, and no security risks. The code is benign and intended solely for testing purposes.",
