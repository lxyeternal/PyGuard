  "purpose": "Configuration setup for the Sphinx documentation builder to generate project documentation.",
  "sources": "Import statements for os and sys modules, sys.path modification, and configuration variables",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data output; configuration variables are statically defined",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration only",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or hidden functionalities. The code is standard configuration for documentation generation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Sphinx configuration file, importing os and sys modules, modifying sys.path for module discovery, and setting static configuration parameters such as project info, extensions, theme options, and static paths. There are no dynamic or external data inputs, no code execution based on untrusted data, and no suspicious patterns. The code appears benign and conventional for documentation setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign Sphinx configuration file with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is purely for documentation purposes with static setup parameters.",
