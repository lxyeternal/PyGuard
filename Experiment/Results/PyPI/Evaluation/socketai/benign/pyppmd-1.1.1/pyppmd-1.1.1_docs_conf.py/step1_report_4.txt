  "purpose": "Configuration setup for Sphinx documentation builder for the 'pyppmd' project.",
  "sources": "Imports os and sys modules, modifies sys.path, defines project metadata, Sphinx extensions, HTML theme options, and static paths.",
  "sinks": "No identifiable sinks that handle untrusted data or user input; static paths and theme options are static configurations.",
  "flows": "No flow of untrusted data from sources to sinks; configuration parameters are static or derived from safe, controlled sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. All code appears to be standard configuration code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, modifies the module search path in a typical way, and sets static configuration parameters for Sphinx documentation. All variables and imports are standard and controlled. No external data input, dynamic code execution, or sensitive data handling is present. No indications of malicious behavior or malware, and the code is straightforward configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Sphinx documentation configuration file with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It solely contains configuration settings for documentation generation.",
