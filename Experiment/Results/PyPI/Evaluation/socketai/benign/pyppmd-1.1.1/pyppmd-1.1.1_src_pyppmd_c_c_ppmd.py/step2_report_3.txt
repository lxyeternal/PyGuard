  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code imports specific constants and classes related to PPMD compression algorithms from a local module `._ppmd`.\n- It defines a custom exception class `PpmdError`.\n- It exposes these components via `__all__`.\n- The code is straightforward, with no data processing, network operations, or dynamic behaviors.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports conclude that the code is benign, straightforward, and only performs imports and class definitions. No issues such as obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning?**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that the code is a simple interface layer. No logical flaws are apparent.\n\n- **Scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, security risk):**  \n  All reports assign scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n- **Risk scores higher than 0.5?**  \n  None are; all are 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n- **Malware score justification:**  \n  Since the code only imports and defines an exception, with no suspicious behavior, a malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  The reports avoid assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.\n\n- **Consistency of scores with the report?**  \n  Yes, the scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The code appears to be part of a larger compression library, likely a wrapper around a C/Cython extension (`._ppmd`).\n- No signs of obfuscation, hidden payloads, or malicious intent.\n- The exception class and constants are standard for such modules.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign, standard nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nAll evidence points to this being a straightforward interface module for PPMD compression algorithms, with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain at zero.\n\n**If I were to assign my own scores based on this review:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is safe and standard for a library component.",
