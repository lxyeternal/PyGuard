{
  "purpose": "This code provides an interface to import and expose certain classes and constants related to PPMD compression algorithms, likely for use in encoding or decoding data streams.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module ._ppmd, which is likely a compiled or implemented extension module",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; the code does not process or output external data beyond imports and exception definition",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code primarily defines and exports classes and constants",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs are present; simple import/export and class definition",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific constants and classes from a local extension module and exposes them via __all__ for external use. It defines a custom exception class for PPMd errors, which is straightforward and standard. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network operations, data leaks, or hidden code. The module appears to be a typical interface layer for a compression library extension.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module interface exposing PPMD compression classes and constants, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
