{
  "purpose": "This module provides access to specific constants and classes related to PPMD compression algorithms, specifically Ppmd7 and Ppmd8 encoders and decoders, along with an error class.",
  "sources": "Imports from a local module ._ppmd",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "N/A - No data flow from untrusted sources to critical functions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code appears to be standard import and class definition",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific constants and classes from a local module, defines an exception class, and declares an __all__ list for module exports. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, and no handling of untrusted data. The structure is straightforward and typical for a Python package module, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple interface module for PPMD compression classes and constants, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It appears to be a standard part of a larger library.",
