  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward import and class definition module related to PPMD compression.\n- No data processing, network operations, or untrusted data handling is present.\n- The code is importing from a local extension module (`._ppmd`), likely implemented in C/Cython.\n- The custom exception class `PpmdError` is standard and descriptive.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious code are evident.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which seems appropriate given the evidence.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code **does not** contain any malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n- The import statements are from a private/internal module, which is typical for extension modules.\n- The exception class is standard for error handling.\n- No signs of obfuscation or data leaks.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; no logical flaws or mistakes are apparent.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0) are reasonable and justified.\n- The confidence levels are high (1), reflecting a solid understanding.\n\n### Scores review:\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is justified.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- The security risk scores are 0, aligning with the absence of vulnerabilities.\n\n### Risk justification:\n- Since the code is only importing and defining an exception class, with no malicious behavior, the risk scores should remain at 0.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is based solely on the code provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is a benign, standard interface module for PPMD compression classes and constants. The reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is straightforward, with no malicious or suspicious elements.  \n- The scores are appropriate and justified.  \n- No changes needed.  \n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.",
