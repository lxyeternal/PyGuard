{
  "purpose": "Provides an interface to PPMD compression classes and constants imported from a local extension module.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the internal module '._ppmd'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code only imports and defines classes/constants.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code does not process data or handle untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific constants and classes related to PPMD compression from a local extension module, defines a custom exception class, and sets the public API via __all__. There are no data processing, network operations, or dynamic behaviors. The code is typical for a Python wrapper around a C/Cython extension, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0. The code's simplicity and clarity support these conclusions, and no further issues are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard interface module for PPMD compression classes and constants. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are justified and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
