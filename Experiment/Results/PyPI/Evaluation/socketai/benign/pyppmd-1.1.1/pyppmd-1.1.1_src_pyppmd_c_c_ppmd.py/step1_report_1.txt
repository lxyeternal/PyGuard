{
  "purpose": "This source code imports specific constants and classes related to PPMD compression algorithms, and defines a custom exception for PPMd errors.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the ._ppmd module, which likely reads internal library data.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data are present; no data is processed or output in this code.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing classes/constants to defining an exception class; no data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, importing and defining classes and constants.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific constants and classes from a local module, likely related to PPMD compression. It defines a custom exception for error handling. No suspicious code, obfuscated parts, or data leaks are present. The code appears to be part of a larger package focused on compression algorithms, with no malicious behavior or security issues visible.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import and class definition module related to PPMD compression. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and standard for a compression library component.",
