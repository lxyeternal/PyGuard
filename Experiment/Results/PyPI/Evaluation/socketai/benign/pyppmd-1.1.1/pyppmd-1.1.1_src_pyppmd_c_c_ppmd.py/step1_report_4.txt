{
  "purpose": "To import and expose classes and constants related to PPMD compression/decompression from a private module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from ._ppmd module.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "N/A - the code only performs imports and defines an exception class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code appears straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific constants and classes from a relative module named ._ppmd, then exposes them via __all__ for public use. It defines a custom exception class PpmdError with a descriptive docstring. There is no handling of input data, network operations, or sensitive information. The imports and class definitions are typical for a package exposing internal modules, and no obfuscated or suspicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import and export interface with a custom exception class. It appears to be a standard module setup without malicious intent or security risks.",
