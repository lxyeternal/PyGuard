{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific constants and classes related to PPMD compression algorithms and defines a custom exception class for handling errors related to the PPMd library.",
  "sources": "The code reads module imports from a local module '._ppmd'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs are present in this code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only sets up imports and a simple exception class.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual code patterns. The __all__ variable explicitly exposes imported classes and constants, which is standard practice. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific components from a local '_ppmd' module, likely written in C or Cython, related to PPMd compression algorithms. It then defines an exception class for handling library call failures. The __all__ variable controls the public API. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors. The module appears to be a standard wrapper or interface for compression functionality without any embedded malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple interface setup for PPMd compression algorithms, with no malicious or security-threatening behaviors detected. It is standard in structure and purpose, with no anomalous or suspicious code present.",
