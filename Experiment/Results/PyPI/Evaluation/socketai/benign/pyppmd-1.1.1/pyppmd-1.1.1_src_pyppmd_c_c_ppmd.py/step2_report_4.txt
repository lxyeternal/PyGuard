  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their conclusions with the code, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Imports specific constants and classes related to PPMD compression algorithms from a local module `._ppmd`.\n- Defines a custom exception class `PpmdError`.\n- Sets `__all__` to expose imported symbols.\n\n**Security and Malware Considerations:**\n- The code is purely import/export and class definition; it does not process data, handle network connections, or include any executable payloads.\n- The imported module `._ppmd` is likely a compiled extension (e.g., C or Cython), which is common for performance-critical libraries like compression algorithms.\n- No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The purpose is clearly to provide an interface to compression classes and constants.\n\n**Review of Each Report:**\n- All five reports agree that the code is straightforward, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- They correctly identify that the code does not handle untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain hidden payloads.\n- The confidence levels are high (1), and all assign malware and security risk scores of 0.\n\n**Scores and Justification:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports is appropriate. No malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 is justified; the code is a simple interface layer with no security implications.\n\n**Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n- No issues are identified that would warrant raising the scores.\n- The reports are consistent and justified.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- The code is benign, serving as a standard interface for compression classes.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**My Overall Estimate:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code is a typical, benign module exposing internal compression classes and constants. There are no security concerns or malicious indicators present.",
