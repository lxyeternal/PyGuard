  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code snippet provided.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code imports specific constants and classes from a local module `._ppmd`.\n- It defines a custom exception class `PpmdError`.\n- It sets `__all__` to expose certain names.\n- The code appears to be a straightforward interface or wrapper for PPMD compression algorithms, likely implemented in a compiled extension module.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple import and class definition module with no data processing, network activity, or suspicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- **Are there any errors or flaws?**  \n  **No.** All reports are consistent in their assessment that the code is benign, standard, and lacks malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Score Evaluations:\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`. This is appropriate because there's no evidence of malicious behavior, such as code injection, network activity, or payloads.  \n  **Conclusion:** No change needed.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or code hiding.  \n  **Conclusion:** No change needed.\n\n- **Risk Score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`, citing the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior. Given the code's nature, this seems reasonable.  \n  **Conclusion:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Observations:\n- The code's purpose is purely to expose classes/constants from an internal module, likely for use elsewhere.  \n- No data flows from untrusted sources, no dynamic code execution, and no handling of sensitive data are present.  \n- The consistent and confident assessments across all reports support that the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\nBased on the code and the reports, I agree with their assessments. The code is a standard interface module with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a simple import/export module, with no suspicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The reports are thorough and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are correct in their evaluation. The code is benign, with no security issues or malicious intent. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
