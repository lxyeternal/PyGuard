  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for configuration management errors.",
  "sources": "None; exception classes do not read input or data at runtime.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or output based on external input.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow paths from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The class definitions are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code only defines custom exception classes with constructors and string representations. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, file I/O, or handling of external inputs. The exception classes do not include any code that could be malicious or maliciously disguised. The use of string formatting and inheritance from Exception is standard. Overall, the code appears to be standard boilerplate for error handling without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as custom exception definitions for configuration errors. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
