  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for configuration errors and remote provider issues.",
  "sources": "None (no input reading or external data fetching).",
  "sinks": "None (no data sinks or external communication).",
  "flows": "None (no data flow from sources to sinks).",
  "anomalies": "None; code consists solely of exception class definitions with straightforward string formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code creates custom exception classes inheriting from Python's Exception. Each class initializes with a message and optional parameters, and defines a string representation method. There are no input or output operations, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious network or file operations. The structure and content are typical for error handling in Python projects. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious backdoors, or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for configuration error handling. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code appears safe and purely for error management.",
