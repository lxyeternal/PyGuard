  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for configuration-related errors.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes and methods.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or output handling occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data paths are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hidden code, or obfuscation detected. The exception classes appear straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code creates several custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, each with an init method setting a message and optionally other parameters, then formatting a string representation. The code is standard for error handling in Python, with no evidence of malicious behavior. There are no external data inputs, no code injections, no network activity, or any suspicious operations. All classes serve as structured error indicators related to configuration management. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be purely for defining custom exceptions for configuration errors. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious activity, and no security risks. It is safe and straightforward.",
