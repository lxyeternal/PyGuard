  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a set of straightforward custom exception classes.\n   - No dynamic code, external input handling, network operations, or file I/O.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious constructs.\n   - The code is boilerplate for error handling, with no vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is benign and standard.\n   - No logical errors or misleading claims are present.\n   - The reasoning that these are just exception class definitions is accurate.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The high confidence (1) and low suspicion are justified.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports agree on the benign nature, and the code is simple exception definitions, there is no reason to assign higher risk scores.\n   - No potential vulnerabilities or malicious activity are suggested or implied.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n   - No malicious intent or behavior is evident.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they stick to analyzing the code as written.\n   - No unwarranted security concerns are raised.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - The code is safe, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\nThe code is purely boilerplate exception class definitions with no malicious or security-related issues. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**My Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the evidence presented.",
