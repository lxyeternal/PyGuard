  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for configuration-related errors in a system.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; exception messages are passed as input to the constructors.",
  "sinks": "Exception message formatting and raising, which could potentially log or display messages.",
  "flows": "Input messages flow into exception constructors and are formatted for output when exceptions are raised.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code solely defines exception classes with no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code creates several custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, each representing specific error conditions related to configuration files and remote providers. The constructors store messages and other relevant details, and the __str__ methods generate formatted string representations for error messages. No data is read from untrusted sources during execution, nor are there any suspicious data flows or code behaviors. The code contains no network operations, data leaks, or malicious code patterns. It is straightforward class definitions for error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely defining custom exception classes for handling configuration errors. There is no malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, nor any security concerns detected.",
