  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code:**  \n   All reports agree that the code only defines custom exception classes with straightforward constructors and string representations. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, network activity, file I/O, or external input handling. The code is static, boilerplate error handling code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no suspicious constructs or malicious behavior. No logical errors or flaws are apparent in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**  \n   All reports assign:\n   - Malware score: 0\n   - Obfuscated: 0\n   - Security risk: 0  \n   These are reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores:**  \n   Since all evidence points to benign code, there is no justification for raising the scores. The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious or pose security risks.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**  \n   The malware score is correctly set to 0 across all reports, aligning with the analysis.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \n   The reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on code inspection, which is appropriate.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the report content and the code analysis.\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**  \nThe code is purely defining custom exception classes for configuration errors, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is safe, standard, and benign.",
