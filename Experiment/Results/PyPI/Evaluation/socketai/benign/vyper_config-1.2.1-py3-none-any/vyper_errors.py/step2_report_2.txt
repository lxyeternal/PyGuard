  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Defines five custom exception classes:\n  - `ConfigFileNotFoundError`\n  - `RemoteConfigError`\n  - `UnsupportedConfigError`\n  - `UnsupportedRemoteProviderError`\n- Each class has an `__init__` method that stores a message and other parameters, and a `__str__` method for formatted error messages.\n- The code is straightforward, with no external data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious constructs.\n\n**Review of Reports:**\n- All reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, straightforward, and solely for error handling.\n- No anomalies, suspicious behavior, or security risks are identified.\n- The malware scores are all 0, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n- The security risk scores are 0, aligning with the benign nature.\n\n**Critical Evaluation:**\n- The code does not perform any operations beyond defining exception classes.\n- There are no external inputs, network calls, or data flows that could be exploited.\n- The string formatting and inheritance are standard Python practices.\n- The purpose is purely to facilitate error reporting within a larger system.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is safe, standard, and does not introduce any security risks.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate.\n- No changes are necessary based on the current analysis.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the comprehensive reviews and the nature of the code.",
