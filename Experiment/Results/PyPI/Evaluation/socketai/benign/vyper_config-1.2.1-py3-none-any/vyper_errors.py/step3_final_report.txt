{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for configuration-related errors to facilitate error handling within a larger system.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from class constructor parameters such as message and locations, used in __init__ methods.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed or output; the code only formats stored messages for string representation.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor parameters into class attributes, then into __str__ methods for error messages; no external data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward class definitions with no dynamic code, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines five custom exception classes with simple constructors and string representations. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or external input handling. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities. The code is static, boilerplate error handling code, typical in Python projects. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions justify these scores. No logical flaws or security concerns are present. The scores are consistent with the code's purpose and content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely defining exception classes for configuration errors, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
