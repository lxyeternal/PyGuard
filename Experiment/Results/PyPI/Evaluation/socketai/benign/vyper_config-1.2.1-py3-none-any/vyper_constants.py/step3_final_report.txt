  "purpose": "Static configuration listing supported file extensions and remote providers.",
  "sources": "No input sources; static list definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data handling or network activity.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static data used directly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static list definitions for supported extensions and remote providers, with no functions, dynamic code, input handling, or network activity. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. All reports correctly identify the benign, configuration nature of the code, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features. No evidence suggests malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static configuration snippet with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All assessments are accurate and appropriate; the code poses no security threat.",
