  "flows": "None; no data processing or flow from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code declares two lists: one for supported file extensions and another for supported remote providers. There is no dynamic code execution, user input handling, or network activity. The lists are static and contain common configuration options. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard configuration data with no malicious intent or security risks.",
