  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Presence of Issues**:\n   - The original code only defines two static lists: `SUPPORTED_EXTENSIONS` and `SUPPORTED_REMOTE_PROVIDERS`.\n   - There are no functions, dynamic code, user inputs, network activity, or data processing.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are present.\n   - Based on the code snippet, there are no issues or vulnerabilities.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - All reports uniformly state that the code is benign, static, and contains no malicious behavior.\n   - They correctly identify the code as configuration constants without any dynamic or suspicious features.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident in these assessments.\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their conclusions.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the static nature and benign content of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores seem reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:\n   - Since the code is purely static configuration data with no suspicious activity, a high risk score is unwarranted.\n   - The current scores of 0 or 0.1 (implied by 0s) are justified.\n   - No reason exists to elevate the risk scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Considerations**:\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, correctly reflecting the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, so this score is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they simply state the code's static nature.\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are based on assumptions; conclusions are justified.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's static, benign nature.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Final Evaluation**:\n- The code is a straightforward static configuration snippet.\n- All reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should remain at 0.\n- The overall assessment confirms the code is safe with no security concerns.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code's actual content.",
