  "purpose": "The code imports a class named Vyper from a local module and creates an instance of it.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (.vyper) and instantiation of Vyper",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present in the provided code",
  "flows": "Imports module -> creates Vyper instance",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears straightforward and minimal",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard import from a local module and initializes a class instance without any dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. It does not contain any hardcoded secrets, network activity, or other malicious indicators. Given its simplicity, it appears to be a legitimate part of a larger codebase.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a simple import and object instantiation with no malicious behavior detected.",
