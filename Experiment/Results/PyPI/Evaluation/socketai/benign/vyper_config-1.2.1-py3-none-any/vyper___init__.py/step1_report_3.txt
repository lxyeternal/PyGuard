{
  "purpose": "Import the Vyper class from a local module named vyper and instantiate an object of this class.",
  "sources": "The code imports a class from a local module; no external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing occurs beyond the class instantiation.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the import statement into the instantiation of the Vyper object.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no unusual patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple import of a class and creates an instance. There are no apparent malicious behaviors, external data reads, or suspicious operations. Without knowledge of the implementation of the Vyper class, no malicious activity can be inferred. The code itself does not exhibit signs of malware, data leakage, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a basic module import and object instantiation with no indications of malicious intent or security concerns based on the provided code.",
