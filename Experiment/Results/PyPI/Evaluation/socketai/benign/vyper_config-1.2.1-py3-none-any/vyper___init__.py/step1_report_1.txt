  "purpose": "Import and instantiate the Vyper class from the same package/module",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local vyper module",
  "sinks": "Instantiation of the Vyper class, which may execute code depending on its constructor",
  "flows": "Import from .vyper -> instantiation of Vyper object 'v'",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class named Vyper from a local module and creates an instance of it. Without additional context about the Vyper class implementation, it's impossible to determine if the instantiation executes malicious code. The code structure is straightforward and typical for module imports and object creation. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident from this snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple import and object instantiation with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. Further inspection of the Vyper class implementation would be necessary to confirm safety.",
