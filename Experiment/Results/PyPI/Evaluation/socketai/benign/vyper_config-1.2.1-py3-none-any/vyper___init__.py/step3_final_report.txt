  "purpose": "Import a class Vyper from a local module and instantiate it.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .vyper module, instantiation of Vyper object",
  "sinks": "Object creation; no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources",
  "flows": "Import of Vyper class -> instantiation of Vyper object",
  "anomalies": "None detected; code is minimal and straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class Vyper from a local module and creates an instance. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are evident. The security implications depend on the implementation of Vyper, which is not provided. The code itself is benign, and the scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, low risk) are consistent with this assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe and does not exhibit malicious behavior. The current scores are appropriate; further review should focus on the Vyper class implementation for comprehensive security assurance.",
