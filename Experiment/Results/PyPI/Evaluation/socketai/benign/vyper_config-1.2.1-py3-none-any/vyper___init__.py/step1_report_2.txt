  "flows": "Import from local module -> instantiation of Vyper object.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class named Vyper from a local module and creates an instance of it. There are no external inputs, no network operations, or dynamic code execution present. The import is from a relative module, which is standard practice for local project modules. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, simply importing and instantiating a class from a local module. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
