      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured configuration utility with no malicious intent or sabotage. The low risk score is justified, and no obfuscation or malware is detected. External dependencies should be secured to prevent supply chain issues."

      "conclusion": "The code is a typical configuration utility with minor implementation bugs. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent is evident. The low security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate, but fixing property methods would improve robustness. Overall, the code is safe from security threats."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration file watcher with external callback invocation. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected. Minor security concerns relate to external callback trust and potential race conditions, but these do not indicate malicious intent. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
