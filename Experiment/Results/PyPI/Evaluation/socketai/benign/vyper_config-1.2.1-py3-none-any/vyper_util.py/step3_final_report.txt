{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for parsing configuration files in YAML, JSON, and TOML formats, including path resolution and existence checks.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration data from strings or streams, and file paths via pathlib and os.stat.",
  "sinks": "Updates provided dictionary 'd' with parsed configuration data.",
  "flows": "Input data (from files or strings) is parsed and merged into 'd' without executing code or transmitting data externally.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; exception handling is broad but standard.",
  "analysis": "The code employs safe parsing methods (`yaml.safe_load`, `json.loads`, `toml.loads`) and handles errors via a custom exception. It performs local file operations and data merging without executing untrusted code or network activity. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Exception handling could mask specific errors but does not introduce security risks. Overall, the code is a benign configuration utility with minimal security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, secure configuration parser with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is very low, and malware likelihood is nonexistent. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
