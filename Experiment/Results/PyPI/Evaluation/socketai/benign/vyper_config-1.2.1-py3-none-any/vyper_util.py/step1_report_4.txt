{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for configuration file handling, including parsing YAML, JSON, and TOML formats, as well as resolving paths and checking file existence.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include function parameters such as 'r' (configuration content), 'in_path' (file path), and 'path'.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data can flow into 'd.update()' calls when parsing configuration files. Path resolution functions use 'pathlib.Path.resolve()' and 'os.stat()'.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (e.g., 'r') into the parsing functions, then into 'd.update()'. Path functions read from the filesystem and resolve paths.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. The code uses standard libraries and common parsing techniques.",
  "analysis": "The code imports logging and filesystem modules, handles optional imports, defines a custom exception, and provides functions for path resolution and existence checks. Parsing functions safely handle different config formats, catching exceptions to raise custom errors. No insecure or malicious operations are present. No obfuscation, hidden behavior, or suspicious code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility module for configuration handling with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It properly handles exceptions and uses safe parsing methods.",
