  "purpose": "Utility functions for configuration file parsing and path resolution",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions: in_path (file path), r (configuration data), d (dictionary to update), config_type (configuration format)",
  "sinks": "Data parsed from configuration files (yaml, json, toml) updating the dictionary d; potential logs",
  "flows": "Input data from configuration files flows into dictionary d after parsing, logs provide diagnostic info",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or malicious code observed. Use of try-except for fallback in imports and error handling is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles reading configuration data in yaml, json, or toml formats, updating provided dictionaries. It performs path resolution and file existence checks with standard libraries, with error handling that raises custom exceptions. No external network, system modifications, or data exfiltration code is present. No obfuscation or hidden behaviors detected. The functions operate solely on local data and logs.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward configuration utility without any malicious behavior or security risks. It correctly handles data parsing and path resolution without suspicious side effects.",
