  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code and considering the scoring rationale.\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n- The code provides utility functions for configuration parsing (YAML, JSON, TOML).\n- It includes path resolution and existence checks.\n- Uses safe parsing methods (`yaml.safe_load`, `json.loads`, `toml.loads`).\n- Error handling is via a custom exception (`ConfigParserError`).\n- No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Review:\n\n#### **1. Report 1**\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies the code as a standard, safe configuration parser.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — perhaps slightly elevated due to broad exception handling, but overall minimal.\n- **Verdict:** The reasoning is sound; the code is benign.\n\n#### **2. Report 2**\n- **Assessment:** Also correctly notes the code as a benign utility module.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — very low.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable and consistent.\n\n#### **3. Report 3**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to above, confirms safe handling.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.\n- **Verdict:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n#### **4. Report 4**\n- **Assessment:** Again, no suspicious behavior, standard safe parsing.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n#### **5. Report 5**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Consistency & Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2), mainly due to broad exception handling, but not indicating malicious intent.\n\n**Potential discrepancies:**\n- The reports uniformly rate malware as 0, which is justified.\n- The security risk scores are low, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** — minimal, mainly due to broad exception handling, but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, safe configuration utility module. The reports are consistent and justified in their scoring. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** In a real scenario, continuous monitoring and more context (e.g., package origin, build process) would be needed. But based solely on this code snippet and reports, the assessment is sound.",
