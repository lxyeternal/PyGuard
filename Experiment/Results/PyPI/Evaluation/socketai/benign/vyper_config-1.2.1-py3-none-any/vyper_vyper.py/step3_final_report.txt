  "purpose": "A configuration registry managing multiple sources such as environment variables, files, remote providers, args, and defaults, with source prioritization.",
  "sources": "Reads from environment variables, config files, remote providers, command-line args, key/value store, and defaults.",
  "sinks": "Internal data structures; no evidence of data exfiltration or malicious sinks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (env, files, remote, args, defaults) into internal dicts, with source prioritization logic.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns. Remote provider interactions depend on external modules but are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard configuration management utility. It handles multiple data sources, supports aliasing, environment variable mapping, and configuration merging. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Remote provider interactions are typical but depend on external modules which, if compromised, could pose risks. No suspicious network activity or data leaks are evident. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and potential external dependency risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured configuration utility with no malicious intent or sabotage. The low risk score is justified, and no obfuscation or malware is detected. External dependencies should be secured to prevent supply chain issues.",
