{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of pytest unit tests validating exception handling for the kuzu database Python API, ensuring proper error messages for invalid parameters and configurations.",
  "sources": "Static test inputs such as connection objects, database paths, and SQL query strings.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or external data sources; no sinks that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Controlled execution of database commands with predefined parameters; no dynamic or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected; straightforward test code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of controlled unit tests for exception handling, with static inputs and no network activity or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious payloads, obfuscation, or supply chain compromise are present. The tests serve to verify error messages for invalid database operations, which is standard and safe. Dependencies are used in a typical manner, and no suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard testing code with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0. The reports' assessments are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
