  "purpose": "Unit tests for kuzu database operations, including exception handling and input validation.",
  "sources": "Code reads static strings, function parameters, and database file paths.",
  "sinks": "Database execute method, kuzu.Database constructor, pytest.raises assertions.",
  "flows": "No untrusted input flows directly into critical sinks; tests involve controlled exception raising.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors observed. No obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of unit tests designed to verify exception handling and input validation in the kuzu database library. All inputs appear to be static or controlled parameters used to trigger specific exceptions. No external or untrusted data is processed, and no code suggests malicious intent. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The tests are standard, and no anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical test suite for a database library with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It only exercises exception handling and input validation, with no evidence of malware or security risks.",
