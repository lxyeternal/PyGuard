  "purpose": "Unit tests for the kuzu database Python bindings, including exception handling and edge case validation.",
  "sources": "Imports kuzu, pytest, and type_aliases; uses test functions that execute database commands.",
  "sinks": "Executes database commands via conn.execute() which could potentially process untrusted input if misused, but here it is test code with static commands.",
  "flows": "Test functions invoke database operations with controlled, hardcoded SQL statements; no untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors detected. The code is straightforward test code with no hidden dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of test functions that check exception cases in a database API, such as invalid parameters, read-only mode restrictions, database size constraints, and non-existent table queries. All commands are static strings with no user input or dynamic execution. The code uses standard testing practices, and no suspicious or malicious activities are apparent. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious data flows. No obfuscated code, code injection, or privacy violations are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard test code for database exception handling with no evidence of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears safe and typical for testing database behavior under invalid conditions.",
