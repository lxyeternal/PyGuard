{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of asynchronous test functions for the 'kuzu' database client library, focusing on preparing, executing, and managing database queries and connections.",
  "sources": "Static, predefined queries within test functions; no external or untrusted input is processed.",
  "sinks": "Assertions verifying query results; no data leaks, network activity, or external system modifications.",
  "flows": "Preparation of queries -> execution -> result validation -> connection management; all within controlled test environment.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward async test cases for database interactions, with static queries and controlled inputs. No external data influences system behavior maliciously. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present. The assertions confirm correct operation, and there are no signs of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code adheres to standard testing practices, and the data flow is contained within the test environment. The security posture is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured test suite for the 'kuzu' database library. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, reflecting its safe and controlled nature.",
