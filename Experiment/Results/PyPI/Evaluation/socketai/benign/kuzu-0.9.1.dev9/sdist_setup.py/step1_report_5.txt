{
  "purpose": "This script is designed to automate the build process of a Python package named 'kuzu', involving compiling native extensions using CMake and make, reading configuration files, and managing build dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from 'requirements_dev.txt', 'CMakeLists.txt', environment variables (e.g., ARCHFLAGS, MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET, NUM_THREADS), and system information such as Python version and CPU cores.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include subprocess.run calls executing 'make' commands, copying directories with shutil.copytree, and environment variable manipulations which could influence build behavior. However, these are standard build procedures.",
  "flows": "Input from configuration files and environment variables influences subprocess commands and environment settings, which are used to compile and copy build artifacts. No untrusted data flows into sensitive or insecure operations beyond normal build processes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or obfuscated sections are present. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious commands. The code uses standard build tools and practices.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard build operations for a Python package with native extension compilation via CMake and make. It reads version info from a file, manages environment variables for cross-platform compatibility, and cleans/rebuilds build directories. All subprocess calls appear typical for such tasks. No signs of malicious code such as network communication, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors are evident. The operations are confined to build management, with no malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical build script for a Python extension with no malicious behavior or security risks. It manages build configurations and dependencies safely and transparently. There are no indications of malware or suspicious activity.",
