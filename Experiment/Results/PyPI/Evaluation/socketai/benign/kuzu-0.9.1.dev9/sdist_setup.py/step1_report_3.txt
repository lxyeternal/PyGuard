{
  "purpose": "This script is designed to automate the build process for a Python package named 'kuzu', including compiling native extensions via CMake and Make, and packaging the Python code.",
  "sources": "Reading requirements from a file, reading the CMakeLists.txt for version info, environment variables for build configuration, and system calls for build commands.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run calls executing 'make' commands, shutil.copytree and shutil.rmtree for filesystem operations, environment variable usage for build configuration.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence subprocess commands; version info read from files influences setup; build commands depend on environment and file contents.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess.run with check=True for make commands, which could halt on errors; reliance on environment variables without validation; no clear user input or untrusted data sources; no obfuscated code or unusual language features; no hardcoded secrets or credentials.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical build and setup operations: reading version info, setting environment variables, invoking make via subprocess, copying build artifacts. It manages build configuration through environment variables and performs filesystem cleanup and copy operations. All subprocess calls are explicitly defined commands. No suspicious or malicious activity such as network communication, data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection is present. The code appears to be a legitimate build script for a native extension, with standard practices used. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed beyond normal build procedures.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a standard build script for a Python package with native extension compilation. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or suspicious activities. All operations align with typical build workflows, and no malicious signals are detected.",
