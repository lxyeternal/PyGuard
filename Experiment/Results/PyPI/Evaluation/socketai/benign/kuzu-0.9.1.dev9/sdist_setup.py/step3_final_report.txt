{
  "purpose": "Builds the 'kuzu' Python package with native extensions using CMake and Make, managing environment variables and copying build artifacts.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'CMakeLists.txt', requirements from a file, environment variables, and invokes 'make' commands via subprocess.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls to 'make' and filesystem operations such as copying build artifacts.",
  "flows": "Source: reading version and requirements, setting environment variables; Sink: subprocess running 'make', copying files.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess with 'check=True' to run external 'make' commands; no validation of environment variables; reliance on external build tools.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard build operations for a Python extension, invoking external 'make' commands and copying build artifacts. No malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The main security concern is the trustworthiness of the build environment and the contents of the 'make' files, which could be malicious if compromised. The subprocess calls are typical but could pose risks if the build environment is maliciously altered. Overall, the code itself is benign, with a low malware score of 0. Environmental risks are minimal but present due to reliance on external tools. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2-0.4) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard build script with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary security consideration is ensuring the build environment and external build files are trustworthy. The assigned scores are justified and appropriate given the analysis.",
