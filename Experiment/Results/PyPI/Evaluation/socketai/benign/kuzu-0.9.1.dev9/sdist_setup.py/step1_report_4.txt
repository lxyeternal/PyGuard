{
  "purpose": "This script is used to configure, build, and install a Python package named 'kuzu' with native CMake extensions, including version detection and build process automation.",
  "sources": "File reads from 'requirements_dev.txt' and 'CMakeLists.txt', environment variables ('ARCHFLAGS', 'MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET', 'NUM_THREADS'), and system information (sys.version_info).",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls to 'make' for cleaning and building the native extension, file operations (rmtree, copytree) for copying build artifacts, environment variable modifications, and print statements.",
  "flows": "Reading requirements and version info from files → setting environment variables and subprocess commands for build → copying build artifacts to target directories.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks identified. The subprocess commands are standard for build processes, but reliance on environment variables without validation could be risky. No obfuscated code or malicious behaviors evident.",
  "analysis": "The code reads version info and dependencies from specific files, sets environment variables, and executes build commands via subprocess. It uses environment variables to control build parameters, which could be manipulated externally but are typical for build scripts. No malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful commands is detected. The build process appears standard, with file operations to clean and copy build artifacts. All subprocess commands are used for compiling and copying files, common in build scripts. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a typical build setup script for a Python package with native extensions. No malicious intent or security risks are apparent beyond the standard considerations for build scripts that rely on environment variables. It does not contain obfuscated or malicious code. Overall, it appears safe, with no indicators of malware or malicious behavior.",
