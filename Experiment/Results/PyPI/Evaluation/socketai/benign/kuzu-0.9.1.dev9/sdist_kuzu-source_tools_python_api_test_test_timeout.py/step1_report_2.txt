  "purpose": "The code defines a test function for setting a query timeout on a database connection and executing a large query to test interruption behavior.",
  "sources": "conn_db_readonly input, specifically the connection object and its methods",
  "sinks": "conn.set_query_timeout(), conn.execute()",
  "flows": "conn_db_readonly -> conn.set_query_timeout -> conn.execute",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. The SQL query is a large range operation but appears standard for testing purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pytest and a type alias for a database connection. It defines a test function that receives a database connection object. It sets a query timeout to 1000 milliseconds, then runs a large range query designed to trigger an interruption, which is expected to raise a RuntimeError with the message 'Interrupted.' The code appears to be a standard test case for database query timeout handling, with no signs of malicious behavior or malicious code. No suspicious data leakage, backdoors, or malicious side effects are present. The SQL query itself is a large range scan, typical for performance testing, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test script for database query timeout behavior, with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It appears to be safe and intended for testing purposes.",
