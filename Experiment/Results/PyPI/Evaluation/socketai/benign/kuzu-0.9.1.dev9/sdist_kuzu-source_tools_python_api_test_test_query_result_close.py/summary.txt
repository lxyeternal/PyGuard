  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, controlled test script for database setup and querying, with no malicious intent or malware. The use of subprocess to run static code is unusual but not harmful in this context. The security risk is very low, and no obfuscation or malicious activity is detected. The current malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The risk score can be set around 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minor concern over dynamic code execution but overall safe behavior."
