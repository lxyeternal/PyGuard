  "purpose": "This code defines module metadata, licensing, and imports various classes and functions related to Google Cloud OS Config API services and data types for managing configurations, inventories, policies, and vulnerabilities.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'google.cloud.osconfig_v1' for version info; relative imports from internal modules for service clients and data types.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating potential data leaks or untrusted data handling found.",
  "flows": "No evident data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code primarily performs static imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated segments. The code consists of standard module setup with licensing, imports, and exports.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python module that manages licensing, versioning, and exports of API client classes and data types for a Google Cloud service. It uses standard import statements and defines an '__all__' list for exports. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or suspicious patterns are present. The structure and content are consistent with a library package intended for SDK use, not malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a library interface for Google Cloud OS Config functionalities. No signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks are present.",
