  "purpose": "Static module setup importing classes and constants for Google Cloud OS Config SDK.",
  "sources": "Imports from google.cloud.osconfig_v1 and related submodules, version info.",
  "sinks": "No data handling, no external output, no untrusted data flows.",
  "flows": "Static imports and exports without dynamic or runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward, boilerplate code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard SDK module with licensing, versioning, and class/type imports. No dynamic code, network activity, or data processing present. No signs of obfuscation or malicious patterns. The code's static nature and lack of suspicious behavior indicate a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe client library module for Google Cloud OS Config with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The minimal security risk score (0.1) in the last report is likely a default conservative estimate, but the code itself poses no threat.",
