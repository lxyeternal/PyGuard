{
  "purpose": "Register transport classes for the OsConfigZonalService client SDK, enabling selection among gRPC, asyncio, and REST transports.",
  "sources": "Imports of transport classes from internal modules; creation of an ordered dictionary mapping transport types to classes.",
  "targets": "No untrusted data sources; static registration of class references.",
  "flows": "Import statements -> populate _transport_registry -> export via __all__",
  "anomalies": "No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static setup module that imports specific transport classes, registers them in an ordered dictionary, and exposes them for external use. It contains no external data handling, network activity, or dynamic execution. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and follows standard SDK patterns. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The assigned scores in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and justified based on the code's simplicity and benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK setup component with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe and straightforward nature. No modifications are necessary.",
