{
  "purpose": "Define and register transport classes for the OsConfigZonalService API, including gRPC, asynchronous gRPC, and REST transports.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules and classes, dictionary assignment, and string assignments for __all__.",
  "targets": "No untrusted input sources or user input processing; primarily static code defining classes and registry.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; registry setup is static. No runtime data processing or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward, with standard import and registration patterns, no obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and classes, creates an ordered dictionary for registering transport types, and assigns specific transport classes to registry keys. It then sets __all__ for module exports. The structure is typical for SDK or library setup code, with no indication of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. No data input, external communication, or security-sensitive operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign setup module for transport class registration within an SDK. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
