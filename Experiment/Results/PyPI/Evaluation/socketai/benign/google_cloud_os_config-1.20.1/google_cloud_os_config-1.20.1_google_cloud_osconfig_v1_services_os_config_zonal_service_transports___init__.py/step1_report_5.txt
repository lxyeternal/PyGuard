{
  "purpose": "This code defines a registry for transport classes related to OsConfigZonalService, facilitating different communication protocols (gRPC, asyncio, REST).",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.base, .grpc, .grpc_asyncio, .rest).",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data, no network or file output, no data leaks, no execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Imports -> Registry creation -> Exported symbols",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard pattern for registry setup and module exports. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes related to transport mechanisms, creates an ordered dictionary as a registry, populates it with transport classes keyed by protocol strings, and defines what symbols to export. All patterns are typical for Python package setup and dependency management. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. No obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, no external data handling beyond static imports.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign setup for managing transport classes in a Python package. It contains no malicious code, no suspicious data flows, and no security concerns.",
