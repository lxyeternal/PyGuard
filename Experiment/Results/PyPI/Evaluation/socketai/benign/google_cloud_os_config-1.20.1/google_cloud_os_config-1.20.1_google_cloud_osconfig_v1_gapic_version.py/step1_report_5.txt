  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard license header and version declaration for a Python package, likely part of a larger project.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations present; only metadata and licensing information.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, user input processing, or sensitive data exposure points identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only contains metadata and comments.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. The license comment and version string are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments, licensing information, and a version variable assignment. No executable logic, data handling, or external communication is present. The version string is a typical semantic versioning format, and licensing comments are standard. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code. The file appears to be a simple header or metadata portion of a larger package.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is benign, containing only licensing and version information. No malicious activity or security risks are present.",
