  "sources": "Metadata comments, __version__ variable assignment",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, input/output, or external connections present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is static metadata",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; standard licensing and version info",
