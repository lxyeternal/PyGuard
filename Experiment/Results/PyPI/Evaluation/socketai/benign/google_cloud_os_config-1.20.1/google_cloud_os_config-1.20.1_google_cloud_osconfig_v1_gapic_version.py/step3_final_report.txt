  "purpose": "Metadata header for a Python package, including licensing and version information.",
  "sources": "Assignment of __version__ variable, licensing comments, and copyright notices.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output or external data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static metadata only.",
  "anomalies": "None; standard header comments and version assignment with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments and a version string assignment. It contains no functions, data processing, input/output, dynamic code execution, or external connections. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in all reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the benign, static nature of the code. The confidence scores are high, reflecting certainty in the benign assessment. No logical flaws or vulnerabilities are evident, and the code aligns with standard practices for package headers.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard metadata header with no security concerns or malicious intent. The existing reports accurately classify it as safe, with appropriate scores. No adjustments are necessary.",
