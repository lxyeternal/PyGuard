  "purpose": "This code imports client classes related to Google Cloud's OsConfig Zonal Service, likely for use in managing or interacting with Google Cloud resources.",
  "sources": "Import statements for async_client and client modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; simply imports classes and sets __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard import and export pattern. No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical module initializer defining what classes are exposed for external use. It imports specific classes from relative modules and specifies them in __all__. No user input handling, data processing, or dynamic code execution present. The license and copyright comments are standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module setup for a client library. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
