{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer that imports and exposes client classes for a Python SDK, facilitating access to the API clients.",
  "sources": "The code reads static import statements from local modules (.async_client and .client).",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: import classes from local modules and expose them via __all__, with no data or control flow involving external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is a standard SDK module setup with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple Python module (__init__.py) that imports client classes and defines __all__ for public API exposure. It contains licensing headers and standard import statements. There are no dynamic behaviors, user inputs, network activity, or data processing. The code structure is typical for SDK setup files, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The absence of any suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or external data flows indicates a benign purpose. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module setup for exposing API client classes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores and assessments across the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
