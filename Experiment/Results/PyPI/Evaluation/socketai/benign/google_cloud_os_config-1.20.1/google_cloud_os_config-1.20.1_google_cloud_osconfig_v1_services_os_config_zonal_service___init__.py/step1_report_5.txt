  "purpose": "The code defines imports and exports for a client library related to Google Cloud's OS Config Zonal Service, facilitating access to the service in Python projects.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules '.async_client' and '.client'. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are accessed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present. The code does not send data over the network, write to disk, or execute untrusted commands.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks. The code only imports and exposes classes without any processing or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are observed. The structure and content appear standard for a Python package module.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical __init__.py file for a Python package, importing specific client classes and defining what symbols are publicly available. It contains licensing information, standard import statements, and an __all__ declaration. No malicious or suspicious code patterns are present, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious behaviors. The code is clean, straightforward, and adheres to common practices.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard module initialization file for a Python package that exposes certain client classes. It shows no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The code appears safe and intended solely for package setup purposes.",
