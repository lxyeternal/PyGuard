  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Summary:** The script is a standard setup for a Python package, reading version info, README, dependencies, and configuring package metadata.  \n- **Assessment:** No suspicious code, no external network calls, no untrusted input handling. Regex for version extraction is straightforward.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the lack of malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.  \n- **Risk score:** 0 — justified, as the script performs typical setup tasks with no security concerns.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard package setup with no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Assessment:** No anomalies, no malicious code, straightforward version parsing.  \n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0 — consistent with the code.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Summary:** Again, a typical setup script, reading version info and README, configuring dependencies.  \n- **Assessment:** No untrusted input, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.1 — the slightly elevated risk score might reflect a conservative stance, but given the code's nature, it’s probably slightly overestimated.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Summary:** Standard package setup, no suspicious code.  \n- **Assessment:** Reads version info and README from local files, no external or untrusted input.  \n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard setup procedures.  \n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, dependencies are standard.  \n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.1 — again, slightly conservative but acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code presence:** The code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package. It performs file reads, regex parsing for version, and calls to setuptools.  \n- **Malicious activity:** No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious code.  \n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; code is clear and standard.  \n- **Security risks:** The only minor concern is the small, non-zero risk score in some reports, possibly due to the regex-based version extraction or general cautiousness. However, these are standard practices and do not pose security issues.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0** — no malicious activity detected.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at **0** — code clarity is evident.  \n- **Risk score:** Given the analysis, a risk score of **0** is justified. The small non-zero scores are likely overestimations.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Metric            | Final Suggested Score |\n|-------------------|------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0                      |\n| Obfuscated        | 0                      |\n| Risk              | 0                      |\n\nThe code is a standard, safe setup script with no signs of malicious or suspicious activity.",
