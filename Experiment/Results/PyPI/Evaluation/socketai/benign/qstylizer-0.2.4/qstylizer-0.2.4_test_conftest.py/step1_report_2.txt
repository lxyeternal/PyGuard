{
  "purpose": "The code defines fixtures for use in pytest testing framework, specifically importing modules from 'qstylizer.style' to create style objects and style rules.",
  "sources": "Imports within the fixture functions that load 'qstylizer.style' modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no use of untrusted data or external effects beyond importing modules.",
  "flows": "Import statements flow from source to fixtures, but no data or untrusted input flows into vulnerable functions or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. The code simply imports modules and returns class or object references.",
  "analysis": "The code contains two pytest fixtures that import a specific style module and return either an object instance or a class reference. There are no suspicious code patterns, no external network calls, data leaks, or malicious logic. The imports are standard and contained within testing fixtures, which do not pose security risks. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward pytest setup for styling classes, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a benign testing utility with standard imports and fixture definitions.",
