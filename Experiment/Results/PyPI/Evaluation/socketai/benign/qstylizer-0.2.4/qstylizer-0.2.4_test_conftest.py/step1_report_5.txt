{
  "purpose": "This code defines two pytest fixtures for testing styles using the qstylizer library.",
  "sources": "Imports qstylizer.style module inside fixture functions, which are invoked during tests.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs; no network or file system operations.",
  "flows": "Fixtures import modules upon invocation but do not process or transfer untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The imports are standard and do not involve dynamic execution or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of pytest fixture definitions that import specific classes from the qstylizer.style module. There are no data inputs, network operations, or code execution beyond standard imports. The fixtures provide style objects and classes for testing purposes. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior is apparent. The structure is straightforward and adheres to standard testing practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test setup that imports styling classes for use in tests. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. The overall security assessment is low.",
