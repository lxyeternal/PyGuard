  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as straightforward pytest fixture definitions that import modules/classes from 'qstylizer.style' and return them.\n- No external data, user input, environment variables, network calls, or code execution are involved.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are identified.\n- The code is intended for test setup purposes, which is typical and benign.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code snippets are simple: import modules within fixtures and return either an object or class.\n- The absence of data flows from untrusted sources, sinks, or any dynamic code execution reduces the risk significantly.\n- The reports uniformly conclude that there are no security concerns or malware indicators.\n\n**Scores:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as zero or near-zero, which aligns with the analysis.\n- Confidence levels are high, reflecting certainty about benign nature.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The only point to consider is the report with a \"securityRisk\" of 0.1 and confidence 0.9, which slightly suggests a minimal concern. Given the code's simplicity, this seems unwarranted.\n- The malware scores are correctly zero; no malicious activity is indicated.\n\n**My assessment:**\n- The code is entirely benign.\n- Malware score should be 0.\n- Obfuscated score should be 0.\n- Risk score should be 0, since there's no security concern.\n\n**Final justification:**\n- No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risk.\n- The code is standard test setup code, with no suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** All reports are consistent with this assessment; no changes needed.",
