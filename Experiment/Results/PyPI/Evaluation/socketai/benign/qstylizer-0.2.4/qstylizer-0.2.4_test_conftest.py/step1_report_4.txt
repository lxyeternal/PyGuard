{
  "purpose": "The code defines fixtures for testing, specifically for loading styles using the qstylizer.style library.",
  "sources": "Import statements for pytest and qstylizer.style within fixture functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leakage or system effects are present.",
  "flows": "Fixtures import modules and return classes or objects; no data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior. The code is straightforward test setup code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the pytest testing framework and defines two fixtures that load classes from the qstylizer.style library. There are no inputs from external sources like user input or environment variables. The fixtures simply import modules and return class objects, which are standard in test setup. There are no signs of malicious code such as network activity, data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated logic. The code appears to serve as test scaffolding for style-related classes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign test setup code that imports style-related classes for testing purposes. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
