{
  "purpose": "The code defines pytest fixtures that import styling classes from the 'qstylizer.style' module for use in testing.",
  "sources": "Import statements within fixture functions importing 'qstylizer.style' and returning classes or objects.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports modules and returns classes/objects without processing external input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple pytest fixtures that import a styling module and return either a class or an instance. There are no external data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The code is straightforward, serving as test setup. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The import within functions is acceptable and common in test code. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No further concerns or anomalies are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test fixture setup with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores are appropriate and justified, indicating an extremely low security risk.",
