  "purpose": "Define pytest fixtures for qstylizer.style.StyleSheet and StyleRule classes.",
  "sources": "Import statements within fixture functions",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external outputs",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code simply imports modules and returns classes/objects",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and fixture definitions, no hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code sets up pytest fixtures that import a module (qstylizer.style) and return a class or an object. There are no external data sources, no user input, no environment variable usage, no network calls, and no code execution beyond standard imports. The code appears to be standard test setup code, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. No potential security issues or malware signals are present. The code is simple, clean, and has no suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test fixture setup with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It only imports a module and provides fixtures for use in tests. There are no security concerns or malware indicators.",
