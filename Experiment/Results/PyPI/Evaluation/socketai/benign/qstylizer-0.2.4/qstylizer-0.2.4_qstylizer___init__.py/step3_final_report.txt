  "purpose": "The code is a trivial comment declaring UTF-8 encoding with no executable content.",
  "sources": "The comment line indicating '# coding: utf-8'.",
  "sinks": "No data flows or untrusted data sources; no sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths exist as there is no executable code.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a comment with an encoding declaration; no anomalies or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a non-functional comment specifying UTF-8 encoding. All reports correctly identify the absence of executable code, data flows, or malicious behavior. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the snippet. No logical flaws or security concerns are present. The code poses no threat or security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only a standard encoding comment with no malicious or security implications. The current assessment and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
