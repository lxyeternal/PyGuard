{
  "purpose": "The code specifies the encoding for the script as utf-8, likely to handle non-ASCII characters.",
  "sources": "No data input sources detected in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points present.",
  "flows": "No data flow, input to output, or untrusted data paths observed.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, only encoding declaration; no suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a shebang-like comment indicating utf-8 encoding. There are no functions, variables, or executable statements. This is a standard practice for source files requiring Unicode support and does not involve any data processing or external interactions. No potential vulnerabilities or malicious indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code fragment is harmless, serving only to specify source encoding. No malicious activity or security risks detected.",
