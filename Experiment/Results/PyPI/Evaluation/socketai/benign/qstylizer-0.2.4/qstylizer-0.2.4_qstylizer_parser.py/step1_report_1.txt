{
  "purpose": "Parse a CSS stylesheet string and convert it into a StyleSheet object for further manipulation or analysis.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'stylesheet' which is a string representing CSS code.",
  "sinks": "The code uses serialization functions from tinycss2, but does not directly pass untrusted data to unsafe sinks such as network or file I/O.",
  "flows": "Input string -> tinycss2.parse_stylesheet -> serialization and parsing -> populates StyleSheet object.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. Usage of external libraries is standard for CSS parsing.",
  "analysis": "The function parses CSS code safely using tinycss2, handling errors if parsing fails. It constructs a StyleSheet object from the parsed CSS. No external data is sent or received beyond parsing. No signs of malicious payload, backdoors, or code injection. The code operates solely within the scope of CSS parsing and serialization. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward CSS parser implementation using well-known libraries, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or malicious actions.",
