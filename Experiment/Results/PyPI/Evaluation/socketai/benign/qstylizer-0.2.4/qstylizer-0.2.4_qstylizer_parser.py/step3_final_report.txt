  "purpose": "Parse a CSS stylesheet string into a StyleSheet object using tinycss2 and qstylizer.style.",
  "sources": "Input stylesheet string passed to parse() function.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write to external systems or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input stylesheet -> tinycss2.parse_stylesheet -> serialize components -> populate StyleSheet object.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward CSS parsing with error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code uses tinycss2 to parse a stylesheet string, handling errors if parsing fails. It serializes each node's prelude and declarations, populating a StyleSheet object. No network activity, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns are present. Usage of standard libraries and clear logic indicates benign behavior. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. The process is purely parsing and serialization, which is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe CSS parser with no malicious or suspicious activity. It handles errors properly and performs expected operations without security risks.",
