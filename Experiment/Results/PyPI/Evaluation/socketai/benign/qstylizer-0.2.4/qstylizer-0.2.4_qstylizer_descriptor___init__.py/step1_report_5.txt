  "flows": "No data flow paths exist due to lack of executable code.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of only encoding declaration without any functional code or logic; no anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The provided code consists solely of a coding declaration specifying UTF-8 encoding, which does not execute any actions or contain logic that could be malicious. There are no sources, sinks, data flows, or suspicious constructs present. The snippet is minimal and standard for Python files that include non-ASCII characters, with no indication of malicious intent or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains only a UTF-8 encoding declaration with no executable or malicious content. There are no security concerns or malicious behaviors detected.",
