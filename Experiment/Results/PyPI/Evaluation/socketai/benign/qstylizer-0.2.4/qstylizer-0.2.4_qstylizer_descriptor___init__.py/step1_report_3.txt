  "anomalies": "Code contains only a comment specifying utf-8 encoding; no executable or data-processing code present.",
  "analysis": "The provided code consists solely of a comment indicating the source file encoding ('utf-8') with no further code or logic. There are no inputs, data processing, or any form of data flow. As such, there are no sources, sinks, or flows to analyze. The absence of executable code means there are no security issues or malicious behavior to detect.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a minimal placeholder with only a source code encoding declaration. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a standard file header comment with no security concerns.",
