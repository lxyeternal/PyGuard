  "purpose": "Configuration setup for building Sphinx documentation for the qstylizer project.",
  "sources": "Import statements (`import os`, `import sys`), sys.path.append()",
  "sinks": "None present; no data outputs, network connections, or sensitive operations observed",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "The only notable operation is appending a directory to sys.path, which is standard for including project modules. No hardcoded secrets, code injections, or obfuscated code detected. No dynamic code execution or suspicious imports.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Sphinx configuration file, with standard settings for theme, extensions, and output formats. The only dynamic operation is appending a directory to sys.path to locate project modules, which is common and safe. There are no network operations, credential handling, or external data processing. No suspicious or malicious code is present, nor is there any indication of obfuscation or malware.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration file for documentation generation with Sphinx. It contains no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is safe to use and does not pose any supply chain threat.",
