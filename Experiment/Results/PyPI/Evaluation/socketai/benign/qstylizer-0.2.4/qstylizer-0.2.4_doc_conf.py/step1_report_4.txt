  "purpose": "Configuration file for building documentation using Sphinx for the 'qstylizer' project.",
  "sources": "Imports 'os' and 'sys' modules; appends project root to sys.path; reads configuration parameters and extension lists.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or command executions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the script only sets configuration variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The code consists of standard Sphinx configuration with no hidden or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard Python modules 'os' and 'sys' and appends a directory to sys.path, which is typical for Sphinx configurations. It defines various configuration parameters for documentation generation, including extensions, theme, output options, and project info. No user input handling, network activity, or code execution based on external input is observed. The functions and variables are straightforward and align with typical documentation setup practices. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard Sphinx configuration file with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It solely manages documentation build settings without external data processing or dangerous operations.",
