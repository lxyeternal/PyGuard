{
  "purpose": "The code is a comprehensive test suite for the qstylizer.style module, verifying parsing, sanitization, rule creation, and class behaviors through parameterized tests and mocks.",
  "sources": "Test parameters, function inputs, class method calls, and internal mock objects.",
  "sinks": "Internal function calls and mock interactions; no external data, network, or file operations.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through parsing and sanitization functions into rule creation and class methods, all within controlled test environments.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard testing practices with extensive mocking, parameterization, and assertions. It interacts solely with internal functions and mocks, with no external data or system modifications. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are present. The test suite aims to validate style parsing and rule management, which is typical and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured test suite with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
