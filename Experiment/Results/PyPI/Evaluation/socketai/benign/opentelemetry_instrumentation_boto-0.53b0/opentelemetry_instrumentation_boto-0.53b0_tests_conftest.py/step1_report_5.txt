  "purpose": "Set and remove mock AWS credentials during pytest testing sessions",
  "sources": "Hardcoded credentials assigned to environment variables in pytest_sessionstart",
  "sinks": "Environment variables that could be used by AWS SDKs or other tools relying on AWS credentials",
  "flows": "Assignment of hardcoded credentials in pytest_sessionstart, removal in pytest_sessionfinish",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded credentials ('testing') for AWS keys, which could be misused if exposed outside testing context",
  "analysis": "The code sets AWS credential environment variables to 'testing' during the start of a pytest session, likely for testing purposes. These are removed at session end. While this is common in test environments, hardcoding credentials—even dummy ones—can pose risks if code is improperly handled or exposed outside of a secure testing context. No malicious behavior such as data theft, network transmission, or backdoors is evident. The code appears intended for test environment setup and teardown, not production or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code assigns and removes mock AWS credentials for testing purposes. It does not exhibit malicious intent but uses hardcoded secrets, which should be confined to controlled testing environments. There is no malware or malicious behavior detected. Overall security risk is low if used correctly.",
