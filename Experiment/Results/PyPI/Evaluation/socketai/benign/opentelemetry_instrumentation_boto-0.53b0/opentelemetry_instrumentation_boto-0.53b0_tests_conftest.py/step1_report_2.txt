  "purpose": "Sets and clears environment variables related to AWS credentials during pytest session lifecycle for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Environment variables set via environ dictionary in pytest_sessionstart function.",
  "sinks": "Environment variables used for AWS credentials; potential impact if misused, but currently only set and cleared internally.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are assigned static test values during session start and removed during session end.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials ('testing') for AWS keys and tokens, which is insecure and unusual for production code. No obfuscation or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code modifies environment variables for AWS credentials, setting them to fixed test values at session start and removing them at session end. This pattern is typical for test environments and does not contain malicious behavior. However, the use of hardcoded credentials ('testing') could pose a security risk if this code is misused outside a test context. No suspicious network activity, data leakage, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be intended for testing purposes, setting dummy AWS credentials during pytest sessions. While not malicious, the hardcoded credentials should be used cautiously to avoid accidental exposure or misuse. Overall, no malware or malicious intent is detected.",
