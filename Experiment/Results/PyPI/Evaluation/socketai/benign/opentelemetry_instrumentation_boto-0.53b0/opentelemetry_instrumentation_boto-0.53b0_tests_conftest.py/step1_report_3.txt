  "purpose": "Set and clear AWS environment variables during pytest session lifecycle for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Environment variables accessed and modified via os.environ",
  "sinks": "Environment variables being set and cleared, which could influence AWS SDK behavior",
  "flows": "Environment variables are set at the start of the pytest session and cleared at the end",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded AWS credentials ('testing') are suspicious, indicating potential misuse or misconfiguration. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets AWS-related environment variables to placeholder values ('testing') during the pytest session start, then removes them at session finish. This pattern is typical in test environments to avoid real credential use. There is no evidence of malicious intent such as secret theft, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The hardcoded credentials are suspicious but seem intended for testing purposes rather than malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed for testing with placeholder AWS credentials. Although the hardcoded credentials are not secure for production, they do not indicate malicious behavior. The code itself is benign but should be used cautiously if found outside a testing context.",
