{
  "purpose": "The code sets environment variables related to AWS credentials at the start of a pytest session and removes them at the end, likely for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Environment variables are set using hardcoded strings within the functions 'pytest_sessionstart' and 'pytest_sessionfinish'.",
  "sinks": "The environment variables are set and removed, but there are no direct data leaks or untrusted data flows to other parts of the system.",
  "flows": "Input data (hardcoded credentials) are assigned to environment variables at session start and removed at session finish. No external or untrusted data flow is present.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded AWS credential values ('testing') are used, which is unusual outside testing environments but not inherently malicious. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code manipulates environment variables for AWS credentials during test sessions. The credentials are hardcoded as 'testing', indicating this is for testing or placeholder purposes. No malicious actions like data exfiltration, system compromise, or persistent backdoors are present. The code's purpose is to simulate AWS credential setup in a controlled testing environment. No anomalies suggest malicious intent, but hardcoding credentials is a security concern outside testing contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is intended for testing AWS credential handling within a pytest session. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks beyond the insecure practice of hardcoding credentials for testing purposes. Overall, it poses low risk, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
