  "purpose": "Set and clear dummy AWS environment variables during pytest session for testing.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID', 'AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY', 'AWS_SECURITY_TOKEN', 'AWS_SESSION_TOKEN' being set to static 'testing' strings.",
  "sinks": "Environment variables used as credentials; potential impact if misused outside testing.",
  "flows": "Variables are set at pytest_sessionstart and removed at pytest_sessionfinish.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded 'testing' credentials, which are placeholders for testing purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code straightforwardly sets environment variables to dummy credentials during test sessions and cleans them up afterward. No obfuscation, malicious code, or network activity is present. The use of hardcoded credentials is insecure outside controlled testing environments but is a common pattern for test setups. The code does not perform any malicious actions, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the benign, testing-only nature of the code. The low risk score reflects the insecure practice of hardcoded secrets but is acceptable within a testing context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely for testing purposes, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The main concern is the insecure practice of hardcoded dummy credentials, which should be avoided in production but is acceptable here. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
