  "purpose": "Set and clear dummy AWS environment variables during pytest session lifecycle for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Environment variables are set from hardcoded strings within the code.",
  "sinks": "Environment variables are used as credentials, which could be exploited if misused or if the code is compromised.",
  "flows": "On session start, hardcoded credentials are written to environment variables; on finish, these are removed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded credentials labeled as 'testing' suggests they are placeholders, not malicious per se but insecure if misused.",
  "analysis": "The code sets AWS credential environment variables with static 'testing' values during pytest sessions and cleans them up afterward. This is typical for testing environments and does not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or data leaks are present. The credentials are clearly placeholders, reducing concern for malicious behavior. The code is simple and purpose-specific, with no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is for testing purposes, setting dummy AWS credentials during pytest sessions. It does not contain malicious behavior but should not be used outside a controlled testing environment. No malware or security risks are identified beyond poor security practice of hardcoding credentials, which is acceptable here given the context.",
