  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is solely a header with licensing comments and a version string assignment.\n   - There are no signs of untrusted data input, output, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation.\n   - The code is static and straightforward, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n   - The conclusion in each report that the code is safe and standard is appropriate.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are reasonable given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious elements.\n   - No adjustments are necessary here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - The risk scores are all 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n   - No justification for higher risk scores is needed.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - All reports assign `malware`: 0, which is correct.\n   - The code contains no malicious behavior or indicators of malware.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as a standard license header and version marker.\n   - No unwarranted vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and appropriate for the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign license and version header with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent. No changes to the scores or conclusions are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code poses no security risk.",
