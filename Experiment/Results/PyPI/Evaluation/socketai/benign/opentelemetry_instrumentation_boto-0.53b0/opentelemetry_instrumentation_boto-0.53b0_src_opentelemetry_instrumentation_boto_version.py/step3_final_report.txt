  "anomalies": "None; standard license header and version assignment with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments and a static version string assignment. There are no functions, input/output operations, dynamic code execution, or external dependencies. No obfuscation, malicious patterns, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is purely informational, serving as metadata. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0. The code's simplicity and transparency confirm its benign nature, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign license header and version declaration with no security concerns. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
