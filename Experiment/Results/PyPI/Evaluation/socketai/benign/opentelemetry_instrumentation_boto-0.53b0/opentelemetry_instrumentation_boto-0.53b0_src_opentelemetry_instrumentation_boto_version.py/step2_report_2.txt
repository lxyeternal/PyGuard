  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple header containing licensing comments and a version string assignment.\n- There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.\n- The code is static, with no data input, output, or external dependencies.\n- The reports are consistent in their assessment, assigning a malware score of 0 and a security risk of 0.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code snippets are purely informational, serving as metadata for the package.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious logic are present.\n- The version string is a static assignment, typical in software projects.\n- Licensing comments are standard boilerplate.\n\n**Potential issues or points of critique:**\n- The reports are very uniform, which is reasonable given the code's simplicity.\n- Since all reports agree, there's no conflicting information to challenge.\n- The malware score is correctly set to 0, and the obfuscated score is 0, which aligns with the code's transparency.\n- The security risk is appropriately low.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- The assigned malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are reasonable and justified.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- The scoring aligns with the code's nature.\n- No further action or concern is warranted based on this snippet.\n\n**Summary:**\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code's content.",
