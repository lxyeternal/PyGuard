  "purpose": "This source code appears to be a generic Python script, possibly for data processing or utility functions, with no explicit purpose specified.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables, function inputs, and possibly external modules or APIs.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file writes, or subprocess executions, if present, which could be exploited if fed untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources such as environment variables or function arguments to sinks like system calls, network requests, or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious strings detected. No obfuscated code, unusual language features, or dynamic execution observed. The code structure appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "A detailed step-by-step review shows standard use of Python modules and functions. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious logic are present. The code does not demonstrate malicious network activity, credential theft, or system manipulation. The overall structure is clear and appears legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems benign, with no suspicious anomalies or malware detected.",
