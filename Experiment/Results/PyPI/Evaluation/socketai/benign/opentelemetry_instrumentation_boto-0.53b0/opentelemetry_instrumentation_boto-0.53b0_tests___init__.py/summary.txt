  "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are common in malicious scripts, but lacks definitive malicious payloads. The scores assigned (malware=0.4, obfuscated=0.7, securityRisk=0.55) are justified. The overall security risk is moderate, warranting caution but not immediate disqualification of the package."
