  "purpose": "Analyze the supply chain security and potential malicious behavior of the Python package code, focusing on suspicious patterns such as dynamic execution, obfuscation, and data leaks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, dynamic code execution points (eval, exec), cryptic variable names, conditional masking, input/output functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, execution of dynamically generated code, network connections, file modifications, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Input sources (environment variables, user input) -> dynamic code execution (exec/eval) -> potential malicious actions (data leaks, command execution).",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec with cryptic variable names, obfuscated code patterns, conditional masking, absence of clear data flow, suspicious variable naming, dynamic execution without context.",
  "analysis": "The code employs dynamic execution (exec), uses cryptic variable names, and features conditional masking, indicating obfuscation. No explicit malicious payloads are present, but the structure suggests potential for malicious behavior. The use of exec and obfuscation increases suspicion, with scores reflecting moderate risk. No hardcoded secrets or payloads are detected, and the code appears to be designed to hide intent. The absence of network activity or data leaks in the provided snippet limits certainty, but the suspicious patterns justify a cautious stance.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are common in malicious scripts, but lacks definitive malicious payloads. The scores assigned (malware=0.4, obfuscated=0.7, securityRisk=0.55) are justified. The overall security risk is moderate, warranting caution but not immediate disqualification of the package.",
