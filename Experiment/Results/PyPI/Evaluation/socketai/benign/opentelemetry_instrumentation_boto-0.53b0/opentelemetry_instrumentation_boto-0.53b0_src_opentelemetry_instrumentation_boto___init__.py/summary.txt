  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign OpenTelemetry instrumentation module for Boto, designed for request tracing. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to potential data exposure in span attributes, which the code mitigates by excluding sensitive services. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, justified by the potential for data exposure if misused. Overall, it is a safe and standard implementation."
