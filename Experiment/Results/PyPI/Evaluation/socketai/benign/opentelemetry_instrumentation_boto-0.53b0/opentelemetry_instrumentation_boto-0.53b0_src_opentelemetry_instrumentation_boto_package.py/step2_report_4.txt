  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple tuple assignment containing a dependency specification for 'boto~=2.0'.\n- The code is static, with no input/output, data flow, or dynamic behavior.\n- The license header is standard and does not introduce any malicious content.\n- The dependency string 'boto~=2.0' is a common semantic versioning constraint, not inherently malicious.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or code that could be used maliciously are present.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- **Presence of malicious activity:** None detected. The code is straightforward and typical for dependency declaration.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly set to 0; no obfuscation present.\n- **Security risk score:** Correctly low (0), as no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are evident.\n- **Confidence levels:** Mostly 1, indicating high confidence in benign nature, which is appropriate given the simplicity.\n\n**Potential issues or discrepancies:**\n- The only minor point is report #4, which has a confidence of 0.9. Given the simplicity and benign nature, this could be increased to 1 for consistency.\n- The reports are consistent in their assessment, and no changes are necessary.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code snippet is a benign dependency declaration with no malicious intent.\n- The scores are appropriate; no higher risk or malware scores are justified.\n- No further suspicion or concern is warranted based on the provided code.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, just a dependency declaration)\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are needed. The code snippet does not pose any security threat.",
