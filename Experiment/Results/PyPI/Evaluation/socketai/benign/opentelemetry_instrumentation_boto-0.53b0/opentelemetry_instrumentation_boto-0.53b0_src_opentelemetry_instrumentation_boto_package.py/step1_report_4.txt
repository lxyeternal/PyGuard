  "purpose": "Define a tuple containing a dependency specification for a package, likely for dependency management or installation.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string tuple _instruments",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no data or input handling or untrusted data usage",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; static declaration only",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; the code is simple, with a standard dependency specification string",
  "analysis": "The code declares a tuple with a dependency version specifier for 'boto'. It appears to be part of a larger configuration or script. There are no inputs, data processing, or code execution beyond static string assignment. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present. The content is straightforward and common in dependency declarations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign dependency specification with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
