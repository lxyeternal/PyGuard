  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe very minimal code: a license header and a single assignment of a tuple containing a dependency string `'boto~=2.0'`.\n- No dynamic code, input/output, or data processing is present.\n- The dependency string is a common semantic versioning specifier, indicating a dependency on the `boto` library with version approximately 2.0.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code matches the description: a straightforward tuple assignment with a dependency string.\n- No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated logic are present.\n- The code appears benign and standard for dependency declaration.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No errors or flaws are evident.\n- The only potential concern is that dependency specifications can be misused if further code dynamically manipulates them, but no such code exists here.\n- The code is minimal and typical for dependency management.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0 or very close to 0.\n- Given the benign nature, these scores seem appropriate.\n- The confidence levels are high (1 or 0.9), which is reasonable given the simplicity.\n\n### Justifications for risk scores:\n- Since there's no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk, scores of 0 are justified.\n- The only minor note is the dependency specification, which by itself isn't risky but could be misused in a larger context. However, in this isolated snippet, it’s harmless.\n\n### Malware Score:\n- Confirmed as 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- No malicious activity or payloads are indicated.\n\n### Potential Vulnerabilities:\n- No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the code is too minimal to analyze for vulnerabilities.\n- No dynamic behavior or external input handling.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Estimated scores based on the code and reports:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code or payloads)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Security Risk:** 0 (no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The code is a standard dependency declaration snippet.\n- No issues detected that would warrant concern.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. There is no evidence to suggest any malicious intent or security vulnerability in this snippet.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.",
