{
  "purpose": "Declare a tuple containing a version specifier for the 'boto' library, likely for dependency management.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points that could lead to data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks as the code only defines a variable.",
  "anomalies": "Code contains only a tuple assignment; no unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple declaration of a tuple named '_instruments' with a single dependency string. It appears to be part of dependency configuration, possibly for a package or instrumentation setup. No inputs, no outputs, and no malicious constructs are present. The license comments at the top are standard boilerplate and do not contribute to malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, representing a standard dependency declaration with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
