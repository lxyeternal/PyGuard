  "purpose": "Defines a tuple of instrument dependencies for the OpenTelemetry project, specifically including the 'boto' library with a version specification.",
  "sources": "The code reads the hardcoded string tuple '_instruments'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; the code only initializes a static tuple.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of only a version specifier tuple with no additional code, no dynamic execution, or external input handling. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple assignment of a static tuple containing a package specification. There are no functions, no input/output operations, and no complex logic. It appears to be a configuration or dependency declaration. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious activity evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign dependency declaration snippet with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
