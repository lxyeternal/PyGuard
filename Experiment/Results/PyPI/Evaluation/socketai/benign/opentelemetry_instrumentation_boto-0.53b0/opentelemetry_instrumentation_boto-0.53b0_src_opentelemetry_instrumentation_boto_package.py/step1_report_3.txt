  "purpose": "Define a tuple of instrument dependencies for the OpenTelemetry project",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; static assignment of a dependency tuple",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Presence of only a dependency specification; no suspicious or unusual code behavior",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a license comment followed by a tuple assignment to '_instruments' with a dependency string 'boto~=2.0'. This is a standard dependency declaration with no dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs. The dependency version specifier '~=2.0' is a common semantic versioning pattern. No malicious code, backdoors, or data leakage mechanisms are evident. The code appears safe and standard for specifying dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple dependency declaration with no malicious or security concerns. It is a standard practice in Python projects to specify dependencies in this manner.",
