  "purpose": "Declaration of a dependency on the 'boto' library with version approximately 2.0, likely used for instrumentation or dependency management.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of a tuple containing the dependency string 'boto~=2.0'. No input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignment without data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and standard for dependency declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static tuple assignment declaring a dependency on 'boto' with version '~=2.0'. There are no inputs, outputs, dynamic code, or suspicious patterns. The license header is standard and unrelated to malicious activity. The dependency string is common and not inherently malicious. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign dependency declaration with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature. No adjustments to scores are necessary.",
