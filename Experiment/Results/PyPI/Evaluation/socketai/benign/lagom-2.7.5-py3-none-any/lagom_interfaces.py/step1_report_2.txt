{
  "purpose": "This code defines interfaces and abstract base classes for a dependency injection container system in Python, including mechanisms for resolving, defining, and extending dependencies.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; primarily defines abstract classes and type annotations used for dependency resolution.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or handle untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code provides interface definitions without concrete implementations or data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are present. The code consists of class definitions, type annotations, and method signatures without executable logic.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines abstract classes, interfaces, and type variables to structure dependency injection. It does not include any executable code, data handling, or network interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful operations. The absence of concrete implementations means there is no runtime behavior to analyze for malicious activity. The code appears standard for a dependency injection framework, focusing on type safety and extensibility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of interface definitions for a dependency injection container system. There are no indicators of malicious intent, harmful behavior, or security risks within this code snippet. It is a benign component designed for structuring dependency resolution logic.",
