{
  "purpose": "This code defines interfaces and type structures for a dependency injection container system within the 'lagom' package, facilitating dependency resolution, container extension, and debug information gathering.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from type annotations, method parameters, and property getters within the class definitions.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks in this code; it does not perform any data output, network communication, or execution of untrusted input.",
  "flows": "The code establishes source-to-configuration flows, such as container resolve calls to dependency definitions, but no malicious flow paths are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is purely interface and type definitions with no runtime logic or data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of abstract base classes and type definitions for dependency injection, with no executable logic or data processing. It defines interfaces for dependency containers, their resolution methods, and type resolution strategies. There are no functions or methods executing external commands, network access, or handling untrusted input. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are identified. The structure appears standard for a dependency injection framework, and the code does not perform any suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a non-executable, purely declarative set of interface definitions for a dependency injection framework. It contains no malicious or security-sensitive behavior. Therefore, it poses no security risk or malware threat.",
