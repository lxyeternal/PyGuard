{
  "purpose": "The code defines abstract interfaces and type annotations for a dependency injection framework within the 'lagom' package, facilitating dependency resolution and management.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; only internal class and type definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data output, external system calls, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "The code contains only interface declarations; no runtime data flows or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of abstract base classes, type variables, and type annotations, serving as structural definitions for dependency injection. It lacks executable logic, data handling, or external system interactions. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and aligns with standard dependency injection patterns. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The minimal security risk score assigned in one report (0.1) is an overestimation; given the code's nature, the risk is effectively zero.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, purely structural set of interface definitions for a dependency injection framework. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify its safe and standard nature. The security risk score should be 0, the malware score 0, and the obfuscated score 0, reflecting the code's harmless and transparent design.",
