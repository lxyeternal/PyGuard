{
  "purpose": "Defines abstract base classes and type hints for a dependency injection container system in Python.",
  "sources": "No explicit sources of untrusted input; code primarily defines interfaces and type aliases.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data leak points; no network or file operations present.",
  "flows": "No actual data flows; the code sets up structure without concrete execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious constructs. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious function calls observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of interface definitions and type annotations for dependency injection, including container management, dependency resolution, and debugging info. It uses standard Python features (ABC, generics, type hints) and does not perform any runtime operations, data processing, or external communications. No potential malicious behavior such as data theft, backdoors, or system interference is evident. The code appears to be purely structural, with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of interface and type definitions for a dependency injection framework. It contains no executable logic, network activity, or security vulnerabilities. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. Overall, the code appears safe and benign.",
