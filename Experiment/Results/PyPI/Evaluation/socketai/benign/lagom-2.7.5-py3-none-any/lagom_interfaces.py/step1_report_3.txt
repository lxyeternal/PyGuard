{
  "purpose": "Defines abstract interfaces and type annotations for a dependency injection container system within the 'lagom' package.",
  "sources": "The code reads module imports, type variables, and function/class definitions. No input data or external data sources are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted input directly or pass data to untrusted destinations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks. The code primarily defines interfaces and type annotations without executing data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. The code is purely abstract interface definitions with no executable logic.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines abstract classes, type variables, and type annotations for dependency management. There are no implementations, data processing, or external communications. It does not include any dynamic execution, system calls, or suspicious logic. The absence of concrete implementations or runtime behaviors reduces suspicion of malicious intent. The structure appears to be a standard dependency injection framework interface setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of abstract interfaces for a dependency injection container system, with no evidence of malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks. It is intended for dependency management and does not pose any security threats.",
