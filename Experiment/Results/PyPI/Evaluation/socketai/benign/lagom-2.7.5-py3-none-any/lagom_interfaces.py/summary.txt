  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, purely structural set of interface definitions for a dependency injection framework. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify its safe and standard nature. The security risk score should be 0, the malware score 0, and the obfuscated score 0, reflecting the code's harmless and transparent design."
