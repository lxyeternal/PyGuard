  "purpose": "Provides decorators for dependency injection, reflection-based registration, and context management within a container.",
  "sources": "Function annotations, reflection utilities, container method calls (partial, magic_partial, define, define with context managers).",
  "sinks": "Container methods that register dependencies; reflection to determine return types; context managers for resource handling.",
  "flows": "Decorators invoke container methods (partial, define) based on reflected return types; context_dependency_definition wraps generator functions for resource management.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. Reflection and container interactions are standard for DI frameworks.",
  "analysis": "The code implements dependency injection decorators using reflection to determine return types, registering functions or generators with the container. It employs standard patterns for DI, reflection, and context management. No external data, network activity, or code injection observed. Reflection is used for type introspection, which is typical and safe in this context. No obfuscation or backdoors are present. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and adheres to common DI practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard dependency injection utility with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. Reflection and container interactions are typical and do not pose significant security risks. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware likelihood is negligible.",
