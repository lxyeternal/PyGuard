  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The report correctly identifies that the code provides decorators for dependency injection, reflection, and container registration.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** The container methods called are standard for DI frameworks; no external or unsafe inputs are processed.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are detected. Reflection is used for dependency registration, which is typical.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment that the code is safe and standard is accurate.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem reasonable given the analysis.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, correctly identifies DI decorators and reflection.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external network or file operations; container interactions are standard.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior or obfuscation; reflection is used as intended.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, the code appears safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern, dependency injection decorators, reflection, container registration.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or unsafe code execution.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns, no obfuscation, standard reflection usage.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar analysis, decorators for DI, reflection for return types.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or malicious data handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is standard DI framework code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 are appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same, DI decorators, reflection, context managers.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or unsafe data handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, reflection is used normally.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe and standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code uses reflection and container registration in a typical manner.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero, reflecting the inherent risks in reflection and dynamic registration, but these are standard in DI frameworks.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code performs dependency injection registration, reflection-based type extraction, and context management.\n- No external inputs, network activity, file access, or code execution from untrusted sources are present.\n- Reflection is used for type inspection, which is common and safe in this context.\n- No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, standard code)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to reflection and dynamic registration, but within normal bounds for such frameworks)\n\n**Summary:** The code appears safe, standard for dependency injection frameworks, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The small risk score reflects the use of reflection, which is typical but should be used carefully in untrusted environments.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the risk score at 0.2, malware at 0, obfuscated at 0. unless future context indicates otherwise.",
