{
  "purpose": "The code provides decorators for dependency injection and resource management in an application container, facilitating modular and testable code.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function parameters, function return annotations, and reflection of functions (via 'reflect').",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive sinks include container.define and container.partial methods, which register dependencies; reflection of return types; use of context managers and async context managers.",
  "flows": "Data flows from decorated functions through reflection and extraction of return types, into container registration methods (define, partial, magic_partial).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. Use of reflection and dynamic dependency registration appears standard and intended. No obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines dependency injection decorators that register functions or generators into a container, using reflection to determine return types. It employs standard Python practices, including type annotations, reflection, context managers, and decorators. The functions validate input types, manage singleton or transient dependencies, and support asynchronous context management. No malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network communication, or system damage, is evident. The code's use of reflection and dependency registration is consistent with typical DI frameworks and does not suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard dependency injection module with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. It securely registers dependencies, handles context management, and employs reflection appropriately. There is no evidence of malware or security risks.",
