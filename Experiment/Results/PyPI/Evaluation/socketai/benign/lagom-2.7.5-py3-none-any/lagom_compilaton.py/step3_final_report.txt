  "purpose": "Attempt to import 'mypyc_attr' from 'mypy_extensions' for optional type-checking support, with a fallback no-op decorator if the import fails.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'mypy_extensions', fallback function definition",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or sinks involved",
  "flows": "Import attempt -> fallback function (if import fails)",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad 'except:' clause, but benign fallback implementation",
  "analysis": "The code tries to import 'mypyc_attr' from 'mypy_extensions'. If the import fails, it defines a fallback decorator that returns the input unchanged. This pattern is common for optional dependencies and compatibility. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The fallback is a simple identity decorator, and the broad exception handling is acceptable in this context. The code is straightforward and intended solely for compatibility, with no data leaks or malicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard pattern for optional dependency handling in Python. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and overall risk are correctly set to 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1.0).",
