{
  "purpose": "The code provides a fallback definition for 'mypyc_attr' in case it cannot be imported from 'mypy_extensions'.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'mypy_extensions' module",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data is processed or transmitted",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no data flows or untrusted data handling",
  "anomalies": "The fallback function simply returns the input unchanged, which is a common pattern; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import 'mypy_extensions.mypy_extensions' for 'mypyc_attr'. If the import fails, it defines 'mypyc_attr' as a no-op decorator that returns the input unchanged. The fallback does not perform any malicious activity, nor does it process sensitive data. The pattern is typical for compatibility purposes. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious intent is apparent. There are no external data sources or sinks. The code's purpose is purely to maintain compatibility.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple fallback mechanism for importing a typing-related decorator. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and is likely intended for compatibility with type-checking tools.",
