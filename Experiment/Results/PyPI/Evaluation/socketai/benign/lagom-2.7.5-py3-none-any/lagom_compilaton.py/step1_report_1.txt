  "purpose": "Provide a fallback definition for mypyc_attr if the import from mypy_extensions fails, ensuring compatibility.",
  "sources": "Import statement from mypy_extensions, fallback function definition",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present in this code",
  "flows": "Import attempt leading to fallback function definition; no data flows involving untrusted input or output",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad exception clause without specifying exception type; fallback function returns identity, which is benign",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import mypyc_attr from mypy_extensions. If the import fails, it defines a no-op decorator function that returns the input unchanged. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious operations are present. The fallback is designed for compatibility and does not execute any harmful code. The exception handling is broad but contextually benign, as it only substitutes a placeholder. No obfuscation or malware signals are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple compatibility shim that defines a no-op decorator if the import fails. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
