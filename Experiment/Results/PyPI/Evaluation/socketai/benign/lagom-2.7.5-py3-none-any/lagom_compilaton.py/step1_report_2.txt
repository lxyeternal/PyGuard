  "purpose": "Define a fallback decorator function for mypyc_attr if the mypy_extensions import fails.",
  "sources": "Import statement for mypy_extensions and the fallback function definition",
  "sinks": "No clear untrusted data sinks; no external data handling present",
  "flows": "Import attempt -> fallback function definition (no data flow involving untrusted sources)",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad exception clause without specifying exception type; fallback to a simple identity decorator, which is benign",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import 'mypy_extensions' and its 'mypycc_attr' for type annotations or compilation purposes. If the import fails, it defines a no-op decorator that returns the input unchanged. This pattern is common for optional dependencies, ensuring code compatibility without malicious intent. No suspicious or malicious code behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The fallback function is benign and used for compatibility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard fallback implementation for optional type extension support with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It safely handles the absence of the 'mypy_extensions' package by defining a benign decorator.",
