{
  "purpose": "Define a fallback decorator for 'mypy_extensions.mypyc_attr' if the import fails, likely for type hinting or static analysis purposes.",
  "sources": "The import statement from 'mypy_extensions' and the fallback function definition within the except block.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; the code only defines a function or decorator.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow from external sources to sinks; the code is mainly defining a utility function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a common pattern for optional dependency fallback. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious behavior, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import 'mypyc_attr' from 'mypy_extensions'. If the import fails, it defines a dummy 'mypyc_attr' function that acts as a no-op decorator, returning the input unaltered. This pattern ensures compatibility whether or not 'mypy_extensions' is installed, typically used for type checking purposes. The fallback function has no malicious or suspicious characteristics, and the code is straightforward. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility pattern for optional static type extension. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It simply provides a fallback decorator to avoid import errors during runtime or static analysis.",
