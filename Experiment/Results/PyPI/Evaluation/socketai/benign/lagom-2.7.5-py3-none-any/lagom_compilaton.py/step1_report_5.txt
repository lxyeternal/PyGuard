  "purpose": "Provide a fallback implementation for the mypyc_attr decorator if the mypy_extensions package is not installed.",
  "sources": "Import statement for mypy_extensions, and the fallback function definition for mypyc_attr.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks or sensitive operations are present in this code.",
  "flows": "Import attempt (source) to fallback function definition (sink), which is harmless and typical in Python code.",
  "anomalies": "The fallback function simply returns the input unchanged, which is common for decorators that do nothing. No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code tries to import 'mypy_extensions'. If the import fails, it defines a no-op decorator 'mypyc_attr' that simply returns the input unchanged. This pattern is typical for optional dependencies. There are no malicious actions, data leaks, or security issues present. The fallback does not perform any harmful operation and is a benign pattern for optional features.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a safe, standard fallback implementation for a decorator used in type-checking scenarios. It does not contain malware or security risks.",
