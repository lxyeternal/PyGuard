  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for wrapping and decorating functions with argument updating and error handling, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous functions.",
  "sources": "Function arguments (*args, **kwargs), FunctionSpec annotations for dependency info",
  "sinks": "Function invocation with untrusted arguments, raising exceptions with detailed messages",
  "flows": "Input args/kwargs -> wrapped function -> function call -> error handling (if exception) -> custom exception",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external data sources; straightforward logic",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard function wrapping with argument updating and error handling, supporting coroutines. It uses common modules and custom exceptions, with no network, file, or external system interactions. Error handling enhances debugging without security risks. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The security implications are minimal, primarily related to untrusted inputs, but the code itself remains safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for function decoration, with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The scores across reports are consistent and appropriate, with malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk (~0.1). It poses minimal security concerns and is suitable for use in secure environments.",
