{
  "purpose": "The code provides decorators and utility functions for wrapping other functions to add argument updating and error handling capabilities, specifically for functions bound to a container context.",
  "sources": "Reads input from function arguments (`args`, `kwargs`), especially in `_bound_func` and `_error_handling_func`.",
  "sinks": "Function invocation points (`func(*args, **kwargs)`) and exception raising in `_error_handling_func`.",
  "flows": "Inputs are processed by `argument_updater`, then passed to `inner_func` or `func`, with error handling potentially altering control flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic observed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or data exfiltration activities.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, wrapping functions with optional error handling and argument updating. It does not perform any network operations, file manipulations, or access sensitive data. Error handling enhances debug messages for `TypeError` exceptions related to function invocation. No signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a utility for function decoration with error handling and argument modification. There are no malicious behaviors or security risks detected.",
