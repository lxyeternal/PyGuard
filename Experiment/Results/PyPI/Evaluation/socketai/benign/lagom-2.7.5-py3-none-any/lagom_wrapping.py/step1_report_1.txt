{
  "purpose": "The code provides decorators and utility functions to wrap and enhance other functions with additional behavior such as argument updating and error handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function parameters, such as args and kwargs, and inspects function annotations via the 'spec' parameter.",
  "sinks": "Potential data flow from untrusted inputs (args, kwargs) to function invocation; error messages could include details about unresolvable dependencies.",
  "flows": "Input arguments (args, kwargs) -> wrapped functions (_bound_func, _error_handling_func) -> original functions or error handling logic.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior. The error handling adds clarity but is standard. No obfuscation or suspicious imports beyond reflection and functools.",
  "analysis": "The code wraps functions with argument updater logic and optional error handling, particularly for coroutines and synchronous functions. It inspects function annotations and manages errors by raising a custom exception with dependency information. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks are present. The imports are standard for reflection and function wrapping. The logic appears straightforward and typical for decorator functions used in frameworks.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate utility module for function decoration, with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It safely manages function wrapping and error handling in a controlled manner.",
