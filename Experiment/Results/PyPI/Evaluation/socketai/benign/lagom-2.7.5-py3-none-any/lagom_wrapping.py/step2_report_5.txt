  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a utility for wrapping functions, handling arguments, and managing errors.\n- No report identifies suspicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, code obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- The code relies on standard Python modules (`functools`, `inspect`) and custom modules for exceptions and reflection, with no signs of malicious imports.\n- Error handling is focused on providing clearer `TypeError` messages, wrapping the original function calls.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious data flows are present.\n- The code's logic is straightforward, with no indications of malicious intent or backdoors.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports consistently assign 0, citing no malicious behavior. This aligns with the code's functionality.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's clarity.\n- **Security risk score:** Very low (0.1 to 0.2), justified by the code being a benign utility with no external side effects or sensitive data handling.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n\n- The reports are thorough and consistent; no adjustments needed.\n- The highest confidence (1.0) is assigned in some reports, which is appropriate given the clear benign nature.\n- The logic of error handling and function wrapping is standard and safe.\n\n**Critical evaluation:**\n\n- No evidence of supply chain attack vectors, malicious code, or vulnerabilities.\n- The error handling improves debugging but does not introduce security risks.\n- The code does not perform any external operations that could be exploited.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\nBased on all reports and my review, I concur with the provided scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, as it is a utility module)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n\nThis code is a benign, standard utility for function decoration with no malicious or security concern indications.",
