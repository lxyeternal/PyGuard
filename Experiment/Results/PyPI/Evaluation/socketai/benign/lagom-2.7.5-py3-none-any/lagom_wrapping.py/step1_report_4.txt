{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to wrap and decorate functions, primarily for handling argument updates and error handling related to bound functions in a containerized environment.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function arguments (*args, **kwargs) passed to wrapped functions.",
  "sinks": "The code executes the wrapped functions and raises custom exceptions. It does not write to external systems or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Input arguments are passed to argument_updater, which modifies them before calling the original or wrapped function. Errors are caught and transformed into custom exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious data handling, or obfuscation are present. The code uses standard Python libraries and custom exceptions for error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily involves wrapping functions to modify or handle arguments and exceptions. It imports modules for reflection and custom exceptions but does not process or handle any external data sources like network, files, or environment variables. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, remote command execution, or backdoors. The functions perform straightforward wrapping and error handling logic, with no suspicious code flows or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for function decoration and error handling within a Python application. It does not contain malware or security risks based on the provided code snippet.",
