{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes and functions for representing and resolving dependencies in a dependency injection framework, including support for synchronous, asynchronous, generator-based, and alias dependencies.",
  "sources": "Import statements, especially '.exceptions', '.interfaces', and '.util.functional'; class constructors; functions like arity and normalise; method calls such as container.resolve.",
  "sinks": "get_instance methods which resolve dependencies; container.resolve calls; asyncio.ensure_future for asynchronous instantiations.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., resolver functions or types) flow through normalise, which categorizes them into different dependency types, then to get_instance methods which resolve or instantiate dependencies, possibly asynchronously via asyncio.ensure_future.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Lock for thread safety in SingletonWrapper; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious network or file operations; straightforward dependency resolution logic. The code appears to be standard dependency management code with no malicious intent or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple dependency classes, handling synchronous, asynchronous, generator, and alias dependencies. Functions like async_construction, construction, and yielding_construction determine dependency types based on function arity. The SingletonWrapper uses threading.Lock to ensure thread safety during singleton instantiation, which is typical. There are no indications of data leaks, code injection, or malicious behaviors. No suspicious network activity or backdoors are present. The code structure and import usage are consistent with dependency injection frameworks and contain no obfuscated or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard dependency resolution implementation for a dependency injection framework, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The only noteworthy aspect is proper thread safety in singleton creation, which is standard practice. Overall, it is safe based on the provided content.",
