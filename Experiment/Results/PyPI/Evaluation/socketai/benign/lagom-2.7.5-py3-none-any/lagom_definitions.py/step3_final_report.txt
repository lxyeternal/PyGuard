  "purpose": "Dependency injection utility providing classes and functions for constructing, wrapping, aliasing, and managing singleton instances of dependencies, supporting sync, async, generator, and container-based resolutions.",
  "sources": "Callable functions, generator functions, container.resolve calls, constructor invocations, class types, and external resolver functions.",
  "sinks": "Execution of user-provided callables and container.resolve method, which may invoke arbitrary code or external dependencies.",
  "flows": "From source inputs (callables, constructors, container.resolve) through get_instance methods to potential execution points, including user functions and container resolve calls.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code, no obfuscation, proper thread safety in singleton implementations, standard patterns for dependency management.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a dependency injection framework with classes for synchronous, asynchronous, generator-based, aliasing, singleton, and plain object dependencies. It uses thread locks for singleton safety and supports wrapping various callable types. It invokes user-provided functions and container resolve methods without validation, which is typical for such frameworks but could execute malicious code if those functions are compromised. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and inherent trust assumptions in dependency injection systems.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured dependency injection utility with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The main security consideration is the execution of user-provided functions, which is inherent to such frameworks and not indicative of malicious intent. The existing security scores are appropriate and justified.",
