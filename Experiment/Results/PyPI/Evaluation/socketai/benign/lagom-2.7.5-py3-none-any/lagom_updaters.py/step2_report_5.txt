  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code.\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n- The code manages dependency injection containers by cloning extendable containers and wrapping specified dependencies in singleton wrappers with lazy resolution via lambdas.\n- It does not contain hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity.\n- The use of lambdas and wrappers is standard for dependency injection frameworks.\n- No malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration are evident.\n- The code relies on trusted inputs; if 'container' or 'singletons' are malicious, they could cause issues, but this is typical in dependency management.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** No, the code appears correct and standard for dependency injection patterns.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical flaws or security issues are apparent. The code does not perform any unsafe operations beyond standard dependency wrapping.\n\n### Evaluation of Reports:\n- **Purpose:** All reports correctly identify the code as managing singleton dependencies within a container.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** They correctly note reading from 'container' and 'singletons', and writing singleton wrappers into 'new_container'.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No anomalies, no suspicious code patterns, no obfuscation, no external network activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** All reports agree that this is a standard DI pattern, with no malicious intent or security risks.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 in all reports seems reasonable given the straightforward nature.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, correctly identified.\n- **Malware:** 0, no malware present.\n- **SecurityRisk:** The scores are mostly 0.1 or 0.2, reflecting minimal risk. Given the code's benign nature, these seem appropriate.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies:\n- The reports assign a **securityRisk** of 0.1 or 0.2, which is low but not zero. Since the code does not perform any malicious activity, I agree with a **risk score of 0.0** for all reports.\n- The **malware score** is 0 across all reports, which is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- The code is a standard dependency injection utility, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable but could be slightly lowered to reflect the benign nature more accurately.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 (no security risks identified)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are consistent in their assessment that the code is benign and standard for dependency injection. The minor security risk scores could be adjusted downward to zero, but their current values are not unreasonable.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The code is safe, and the scores should reflect that with zero malware and obfuscation scores, and a risk score of 0.",
