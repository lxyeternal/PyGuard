{
  "purpose": "The code manages singleton dependencies within container objects, allowing for cloning and registration of singleton instances.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'container' object via 'resolve' method, and from the 'singletons' list of types.",
  "sinks": "The code assigns new singleton wrappers to the 'new_container' using item assignment, which may alter container state.",
  "flows": "Input 'container' is cloned if extendable, then for each singleton type, a singleton wrapper is created that resolves the dependency from the original container, and this wrapper is assigned to the new container.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious external calls. Use of lambda with resolve is standard in dependency injection. No unusual or malicious code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs dependency injection management by cloning containers if necessary, then wrapping dependencies with singleton wrappers. The 'resolve' method fetches dependencies dynamically, and the singleton wrappers encapsulate these dependencies for singleton behavior. No suspicious data leakage, malicious payload, or backdoor is evident. The code operates within expected dependency management patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard dependency container management utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply manages singleton dependencies in containers, using standard patterns without malicious behavior.",
