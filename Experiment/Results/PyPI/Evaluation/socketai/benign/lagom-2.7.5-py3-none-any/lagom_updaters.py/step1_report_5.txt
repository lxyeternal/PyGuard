{
  "purpose": "The code updates a container with singleton instances wrapped in a SingletonWrapper, utilizing dependency resolution and container cloning.",
  "sources": "Reading container objects (container, new_container), reading dependency types (dep), and resolving dependencies via container.resolve(dep).",
  "sinks": "Assigning SingletonWrapper instances to new_container[dep], which could affect container behavior or data flow if misused.",
  "flows": "Input: container and singletons list → Cloning or referencing container → Wrapping resolve(dep) in SingletonWrapper → Assigning to new_container[dep].",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no obfuscated code; no dynamic code execution; straightforward dependency wrapping.",
  "analysis": "The code performs dependency injection by wrapping resolved dependencies within singleton wrappers and updating a container. It clones the container if it is extendable, ensuring the original container remains unaffected. The process involves resolving dependencies dynamically and storing them in a structured manner. No malicious or suspicious behavior such as network activity, file manipulation, or hidden backdoors is evident. Usage appears to be standard dependency management; no anomalous data flows or code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard dependency container update mechanism with safe practices. There is no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It correctly handles container cloning and dependency wrapping without exposing vulnerabilities.",
