  "purpose": "Manage dependency injection containers by cloning extendable containers and wrapping specified dependencies in singleton wrappers with lazy resolution.",
  "sources": "container.resolve(dep) called within lambdas; container.clone() method; input lists of dependencies.",
  "sinks": "assignment to new_container[dep], which could be exploited if container or dependencies are malicious.",
  "flows": "from container.resolve(dep) via lambda to singleton wrapper assigned in new_container.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard dependency injection pattern: cloning containers if extendable, wrapping dependencies in singleton wrappers with lambdas for lazy resolution, and assigning them back. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is present. The use of lambdas and wrappers is typical in DI frameworks. The security implications depend on the trustworthiness of the container and dependencies, but the code itself is benign. The malware score is correctly 0; the low security risk scores (0.1-0.2) are justified given the pattern, but could be considered as 0 if assuming trusted components. The confidence in the benign nature is high (0.9).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard dependency injection utility for singleton management with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. No modifications are necessary.",
