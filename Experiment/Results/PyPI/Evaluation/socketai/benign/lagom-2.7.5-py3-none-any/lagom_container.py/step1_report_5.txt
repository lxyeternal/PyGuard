{
  "purpose": "This code implements a dependency injection container system in Python, facilitating object construction and management within applications.",
  "sources": "Input data is primarily read from type annotations, function parameters, and configuration via define() methods. No explicit external input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data could flow into constructed objects via dependencies, but there are no direct data leaks, network connections, or file manipulations in the code.",
  "flows": "The flow involves resolving dependencies through reflection and custom definitions, constructing objects, and injecting them into functions. No external data flows to malicious sinks are observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors such as network communication, file modification, or obfuscation are present. The code uses standard dependency injection patterns and reflection. No suspicious code patterns or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a dependency injection framework with classes for managing object creation, container cloning, dependency resolution, and reflection-based instantiation. No suspicious or malicious constructs are present. The logic involves safe and typical patterns for dependency injection, including context management and error handling. The only notable point is the reflective instantiation and dependency resolution, which are common in such frameworks and do not indicate malicious intent. No external network, file, or system modifications are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate dependency injection framework with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It follows standard design patterns without any hidden or malicious code components.",
