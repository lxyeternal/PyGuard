  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, standard dependency injection container that employs reflection for dependency resolution. There are no signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation. The reflection-based design introduces minimal risk when inputs are trusted, and no external malicious data is evident. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use in dependency management scenarios."
