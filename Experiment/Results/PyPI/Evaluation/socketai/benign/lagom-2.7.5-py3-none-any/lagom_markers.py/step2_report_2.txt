  "review": "Let's analyze each report and the associated code carefully.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code defines a singleton class `Injectable` used as a marker for dependency injection.\n- It implements singleton behavior via `__copy__` and `__deepcopy__`.\n- The `__getattr__` method raises an `InjectableNotResolved` exception if attributes are accessed, indicating unresolved dependencies.\n- The singleton object `injectable` is used as a marker in function signatures.\n\n**Security implications:**\n\n- No network calls, data leaks, or external system interactions are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code.\n- The exception raising in `__getattr__` is standard for dependency injection error signaling.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code's behavior aligns with typical DI marker patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and concerns:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports describe the code as a standard DI marker. No issues or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  The code appears well-structured and intentional. The singleton pattern and exception handling are appropriate for its purpose.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`. These are consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n- **Risk scores higher than 0.5?**  \n  None of the reports assign high risk scores. Given the code's benign nature, this is appropriate.\n\n- **Malware score justification:**  \n  Since no malicious activity or payloads are present, malware score should remain 0.\n\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities?**  \n  No assumptions are made beyond the code's apparent purpose; all claims are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- The code is a standard dependency injection marker class with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The scores assigned (all zeros for malware, obfuscated, and low security risk) are justified.\n- The purpose and analysis are accurate; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimates:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, as a precaution, but essentially negligible)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, and the reports correctly identify it as a benign dependency injection utility with no security risks.",
