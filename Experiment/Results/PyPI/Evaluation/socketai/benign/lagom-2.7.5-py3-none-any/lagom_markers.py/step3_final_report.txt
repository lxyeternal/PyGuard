{
  "purpose": "This code defines a singleton class 'Injectable' used as a marker for dependency injection, signaling unresolved dependencies via exceptions.",
  "sources": "The class methods (__bool__, __copy__, __deepcopy__, __getattr__) and the singleton instance 'injectable'.",
  "sinks": "Attribute access (__getattr__) which raises exceptions; no external data or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Attribute access on 'injectable' triggers exception if unresolved; no other data flows or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard singleton pattern and exception raising for unresolved dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard dependency injection marker with singleton behavior, raising exceptions on attribute access to indicate unresolved dependencies. It contains no network calls, data leaks, obfuscation, or malicious payloads. The methods behave as expected for such a pattern, and the singleton 'injectable' serves as a marker object. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard dependency injection utility with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify its purpose and assign appropriate scores.",
