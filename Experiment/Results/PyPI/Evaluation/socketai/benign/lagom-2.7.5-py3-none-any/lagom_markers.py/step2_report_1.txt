  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the original code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code defines a singleton class `Injectable` used as a marker for dependency injection.\n- It implements singleton behavior via `__copy__` and `__deepcopy__`.\n- The `__getattr__` method raises an `InjectableNotResolved` exception unless the attribute is a dunder method.\n- The `injectable` object is an instance of `Injectable`.\n\n**Security assessment:**\n\n- No network, file, or system calls are present.\n- No hardcoded credentials or secrets.\n- No obfuscation or malicious code detected.\n- The pattern is typical for dependency injection frameworks.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n#### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Defines a singleton marker class.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies singleton behavior, exception raising, and standard DI pattern.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent or security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n#### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Similar to above, standard DI marker.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, no malicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard pattern.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n#### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Same pattern, singleton marker with exception handling.\n- **Analysis:** No external interaction, no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard pattern.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n#### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Similar DI marker.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** No security issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n#### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, straightforward DI pattern.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, no risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n\n**Note:** The code's purpose is to serve as a dependency injection marker, which is a common pattern and does not inherently pose security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent.\n- No changes needed.\n- The code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is straightforward, well-understood, and does not perform any malicious actions or obfuscation. It is a standard dependency injection utility.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. The code is safe, with no security concerns.",
