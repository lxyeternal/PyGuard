{
  "purpose": "This code defines an Injectable class used for dependency injection, serving as a singleton marker object to indicate arguments should be injected.",
  "sources": "The code reads class attributes and method calls within the Injectable class, as well as the singleton object 'injectable'.",
  "sinks": "The code could potentially raise exceptions when accessing attributes, but no external data sinks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "No external or untrusted data flows are present; attribute access may trigger exceptions but no data transfer occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code is straightforward, primarily raising exceptions for missing attribute resolution.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a singleton pattern for dependency injection purposes, with methods to prevent multiple instances and to signal unresolved dependencies. The __getattr__ method raises an exception if a non-dunder attribute is accessed, which indicates a misconfiguration or missing binding. No external inputs, network activity, or obfuscated code are present. The pattern is typical for DI frameworks, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard dependency injection utility without any malicious behavior or security risks. It mainly raises exceptions for unresolved dependencies, with no evidence of malicious or harmful code.",
