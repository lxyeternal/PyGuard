{
  "purpose": "Defines an Injectable class used as a singleton marker for dependency injection in Python functions.",
  "sources": "None explicitly; the code does not read input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no outputs or external data handling that could leak data or cause harm.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code does not process untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "The class implements singleton-like behavior and custom attribute access, which is typical for dependency markers. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns are observed. The code only raises exceptions in specific attribute access scenarios.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a singleton marker class 'Injectable' for dependency injection, with methods that ensure it behaves as a singleton and raises exceptions if certain attributes are accessed. No external data input, network activity, or suspicious behavior is present. The purpose is to serve as a marker object, not to perform any harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of a dependency injection marker class with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and consistent with common dependency injection patterns.",
