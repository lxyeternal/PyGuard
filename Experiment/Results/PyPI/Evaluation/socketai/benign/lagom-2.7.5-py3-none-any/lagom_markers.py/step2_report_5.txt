  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- The code defines a singleton class `Injectable` with specific behaviors for dependency injection, including raising exceptions on attribute access and singleton pattern methods.\n- The singleton instance `injectable` is used as a marker for unresolved dependencies.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or data sinks are present.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are detected.\n- The code appears to be a standard pattern used in dependency injection frameworks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Potential Issues:\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Behavior?**  \n  No. The code is a typical DI marker pattern, with no malicious payloads or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscation?**  \n  No obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Code Logic and Behavior:**  \n  The methods `__copy__`, `__deepcopy__`, and `__getattr__` behave as expected for a singleton marker object. The raising of `InjectableNotResolved` on attribute access is a common pattern to signal unresolved dependencies.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Summary:** Correctly identifies the class as a singleton marker for DI, with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0  \n  **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n#### Report 2:\n- **Summary:** Accurately describes the purpose and behavior; no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0  \n  **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n#### Report 3:\n- **Summary:** Same as above; standard DI pattern, no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0  \n  **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n#### Report 4:\n- **Summary:** Correctly notes the class as a singleton marker with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0  \n  **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n#### Report 5:\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion; standard DI utility, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0  \n  **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Analysis and Final Judgment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0. The code does not contain malicious payloads or behaviors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk detected)\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n\nThe code is a standard dependency injection marker pattern, with no signs of malicious activity or security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n| Score Type       | Final Estimated Score |\n|------------------|------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                      |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                      |\n| Security Risk    | 0                      |\n\n**This analysis confirms that the code is safe, standard, and does not pose any security threat.**",
