{
  "purpose": "Defines a singleton class 'Injectable' used as a marker for dependency injection in a larger framework.",
  "sources": "No direct input or data reading sources present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling points observed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow, as the code primarily defines a class with specific behaviors.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to implement a singleton marker object with methods that raise exceptions for attribute access, which could potentially hide malicious behavior but seems standard for dependency injection markers. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. No obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'Injectable' meant for dependency injection markers. It implements singleton-like behavior by returning self in __copy__ and __deepcopy__. The __getattr__ method raises an exception unless the attribute is a dunder method, indicating misuse. The 'injectable' object is an instance of this class, used as a marker. No network calls, data leakage, or suspicious activity are present. The structure and content are consistent with legitimate dependency injection practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate dependency injection marker with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware or suspicious behavior. The design is typical for such frameworks.",
