  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code defines a singleton class `Injectable` used as a marker for dependency injection.\n- The class methods (`__bool__`, `__copy__`, `__deepcopy__`) enforce singleton behavior.\n- The `__getattr__` method raises an `InjectableNotResolved` exception for attribute access, signaling unresolved dependencies.\n- The singleton instance `injectable` is used as a marker object.\n- No external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation is present.\n- The code appears to be a standard pattern in dependency injection frameworks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Potential Issues:\n- **Presence of malicious code?** No. The code is straightforward and aligns with common DI patterns.\n- **Obfuscation?** No. The code is clear.\n- **Malware?** No. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected.\n- **Security risks?** No. The code raises exceptions on misused attributes, which is typical for such markers.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Summary:** Correctly identifies the class as a singleton marker for DI, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0, Confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n#### Report 2:\n- **Summary:** Also correctly describes the class as a DI marker with standard behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0, Confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n#### Report 3:\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, describes singleton pattern and exception raising.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0, Confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n#### Report 4:\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the standard DI marker pattern, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0, Confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n#### Report 5:\n- **Summary:** Same as others, straightforward DI utility.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0, Confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Are the scores reasonable?** Yes. All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which aligns with the code content.\n- **Any anomalies or hidden risks?** No. The code is a standard DI marker class, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Are the explanations consistent?** Yes. They correctly interpret the purpose and behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0. No malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at 0. No obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** Should be 0, as the code is benign and standard.\n\n**Additional note:** The reports are thorough and consistent with the code's intent and structure.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is a benign, standard dependency injection marker pattern with no security concerns.",
