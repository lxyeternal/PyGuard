{
  "purpose": "Defines a singleton class 'Injectable' used as a marker for dependency injection in Python code, and creates a singleton instance 'injectable'.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from class methods, attribute access, and the singleton instance 'injectable'.",
  "sinks": "Potential attribute access triggers exceptions, but there are no data sinks like network, file, or system calls.",
  "flows": "Attribute access on 'injectable' may lead to exceptions if attributes are accessed; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code appears to implement a dependency marker pattern without malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a singleton pattern for 'Injectable' with custom attribute access behavior to signal unresolved dependencies. No network, file, or system interaction is present. The attribute access raises exceptions when attributes are accessed improperly, which is intended for error signaling. The singleton 'injectable' acts as a marker object. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The use of exceptions and singleton pattern appears legitimate for dependency injection management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard dependency injection marker pattern with no malicious intent or security issues. It functions as an internal utility with no external side effects or data leaks.",
