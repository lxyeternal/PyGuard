{
  "purpose": "This code defines a singleton class 'Injectable' used as a marker for dependency injection in Python functions, with methods to indicate unresolved dependencies and prevent attribute access on the singleton object.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function signatures (via annotations and the 'injectable' singleton) and attribute access on the 'injectable' object.",
  "sinks": "Attribute access on 'injectable' object, raising 'InjectableNotResolved' exception.",
  "flows": "Function signatures reference 'injectable'; attribute access on 'injectable' triggers exception if attributes are accessed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, malicious functions, or obfuscated logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a dependency injection marker class, with standard singleton pattern behavior. The __getattr__ method raises an exception when invalid attribute access occurs, which is typical for injection mechanisms. No external network, file operations, or data leakage mechanisms are present. The code does not contain any obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious logic. The only notable aspect is its role in dependency injection, but this is a standard pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign component used in dependency injection. No signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks are detected. It functions as intended for dependency management without any malicious intent.",
