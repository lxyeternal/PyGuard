  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**1. Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n- The code solely defines custom exception classes used within the 'lagom' dependency injection library.\n- It reads type annotations, class attributes, and constructs error messages based on internal state.\n- No external input, network operations, or system modifications are present.\n- The utility function `_dep_type_as_string()` handles type introspection for string representation, primarily for debugging and messaging.\n\n**2. Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is a benign set of exception classes.\n- They note the absence of malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n- The only minor point is the use of `repr()` in `_dep_type_as_string()`, which is benign and standard for debugging.\n\n**3. Score Justifications:**\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate. There are no signs of malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0 or very low values, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**4. Potential Risks and Assumptions:**\n- No claims of vulnerabilities or malicious intent are based on assumptions; the code is purely for error handling.\n- The only potential concern is the use of `repr()` in `_dep_type_as_string()`, but this is standard practice and not malicious.\n\n**5. Consistency of Scores with the Code:**\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis; no discrepancies are evident.\n\n**6. Additional Considerations:**\n- Since the code is only defining exception classes, it does not perform any dynamic execution, input handling, or external communication.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malicious patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, well-structured set of exception class definitions for internal error handling within a dependency injection framework. It does not contain any malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or security risks. The exception messages are informative and based solely on internal state and type information. There are no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or supply chain attacks.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and align with my analysis. The code is benign, with no security concerns. The scores should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk.",
