{
  "purpose": "The code defines a set of custom exception classes used within the 'lagom' dependency injection library to handle various error scenarios such as unresolved dependencies, invalid definitions, circular dependencies, and environment variable issues.",
  "sources": "Type annotations, class attributes, and internal state used to generate exception messages and store error context.",
  "sinks": "String formatting within exception messages, utilizing internal type information and error details; no external input or untrusted data involved.",
  "flows": "Exception classes are instantiated with internal data (types, messages), which are then used to produce descriptive error messages when exceptions are raised.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present. The use of 'repr()' in '_dep_type_as_string()' is standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured set of exception class definitions for internal error handling. It performs type introspection and constructs messages based on internal state, with no dynamic execution, network activity, or external data handling. The utility function '_dep_type_as_string()' safely converts types to strings for messaging. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The exception messages are informative and based solely on internal data, making the code safe for supply chain purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as internal error handling classes for a dependency injection framework. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. The scores are appropriately set to zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk, reflecting its safe and standard nature.",
