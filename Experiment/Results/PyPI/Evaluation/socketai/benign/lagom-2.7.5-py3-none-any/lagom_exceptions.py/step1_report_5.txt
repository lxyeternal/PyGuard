{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes for a dependency injection library named 'lagom'. The purpose is to handle various error scenarios related to dependency resolution, configuration, and environment variable management.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (inspect, typing, abc), and class definitions that create custom exceptions.",
  "sinks": "None detected. The code only defines exception classes and utility functions; it does not perform data processing, input/output operations, or network communication.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow occurs in class definitions or exception declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code contains typical exception class definitions with descriptive messages. The only minor point is the potential usage of repr() for type strings, which is benign and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, focusing on defining exception classes for various error conditions in a dependency injection framework. All classes extend from standard exception types or an internal base exception. Methods and constructors assign attributes and construct error messages, often using internal helper functions like _dep_type_as_string. No input handling, network activity, or code execution is present. The code adheres to standard patterns for defining custom exceptions. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code, such as dynamic code execution, hidden backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of exception class definitions for a dependency injection framework with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is designed for error handling and does not perform any network, file, or system modification actions. The likelihood of malicious behavior is extremely low.",
