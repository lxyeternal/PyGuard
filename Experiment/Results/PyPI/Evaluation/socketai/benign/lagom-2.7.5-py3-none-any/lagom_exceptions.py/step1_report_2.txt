{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes for a dependency injection library called 'lagom'. These exceptions handle various error scenarios such as unresolved dependencies, circular dependencies, environment variable issues, and other configuration errors.",
  "sources": "The code reads static class definitions, class attributes, and constructor parameters. No external or user input sources are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data flows into security-critical functions or external systems. No network communication, file writing, or environment variable modification occurs here.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow paths from external inputs to critical functions; the code primarily raises exceptions with descriptive messages based on internal state.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward with no obfuscated constructs or suspicious logic. The class attributes and exception messages are standard for error handling. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. The `_dep_type_as_string` function includes type handling that is typical for debugging or introspection, not malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code provides structured exception classes for a dependency injection framework. All classes inherit from standard Python exception types, and constructor implementations are for setting up descriptive error messages. The only dynamic behavior involves converting dependency types into strings for messaging purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or hidden code execution. The overall design is consistent with a robust error handling module without any suspicious or malicious components.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for a Python dependency injection library. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code is clean, well-structured, and appears safe for use in production environments.",
