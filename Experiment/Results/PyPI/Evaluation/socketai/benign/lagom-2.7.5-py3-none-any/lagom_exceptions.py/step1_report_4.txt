{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for a dependency injection library to handle various error conditions related to dependency resolution, environment variables, and configuration issues.",
  "sources": "The code reads class and type attributes, constructs error messages, and handles exceptions; no external or untrusted input sources are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "Error messages constructed and raised as exceptions; no data is sent over the network or written to external files. No sinks appear vulnerable to injection or data leakage.",
  "flows": "No complex data flows involving untrusted input to sensitive functions; exception instantiation is straightforward, and message formatting is static or based on internal type info.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are present. The code is standard for exception class definitions. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions used for error handling within a dependency injection framework. It uses standard Python features to define and initialize exception classes, including handling type attributes and constructing informative error messages. There are no external inputs, no network communication, and no code that executes untrusted data. All classes are straightforward, inheriting from built-in exception types, and do not perform any dynamic code evaluation, code injection, or data exfiltration. The purpose is to manage error reporting in a controlled, structured manner.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical set of exception class definitions for internal error handling within a Python library. There is no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It appears to be a benign, standard implementation without security risks or malicious code.",
