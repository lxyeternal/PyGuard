  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code solely defines custom exception classes and a utility function for converting types to strings.\n   - There are no signs of malicious code, dynamic execution, or data leaks.\n   - The exception messages are constructed from internal state and type info, typical for error handling.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward, with no suspicious behavior.\n   - They note the absence of external input handling, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n   - No flaws are evident in the reasoning; the reports are consistent and thorough.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n   - Security risk scores are also 0, which is appropriate.\n   - No changes are necessary; the scores seem reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The code does not perform any network communication, data processing beyond exception messaging, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The exception classes are standard and do not introduce security vulnerabilities.\n   - Therefore, a risk score higher than 0.5 is unwarranted.\n\n5. **Malware Score Justification:**\n   - The code contains no malicious behaviors, backdoors, or hidden functionalities.\n   - The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are based on static analysis; no assumptions about malicious intent are made beyond what is evident.\n   - The reports correctly avoid speculative claims.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risk identified.\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThe code is a standard, well-structured set of exception class definitions for a dependency injection framework. It poses no security threat, contains no obfuscation, and does not perform any malicious activities.\n\n**This supply chain report can be confidently rated as safe.**",
