  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for a dependency injection library 'lagom', used for error handling and reporting.",
  "sources": "Class definitions, exception initialization methods, and utility function _dep_type_as_string.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data is taken from untrusted sources or sent to external systems.",
  "flows": "The code primarily defines exception classes and their messages; no data flow from input to output or external system.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code behaviors, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection. The code is straightforward exception class definitions with no obfuscated or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code contains class definitions for custom exceptions related to a dependency injection framework, with methods for initializing error messages and handling dependency types. No external data sources or sinks are present. The utility function _dep_type_as_string is used solely for string representation of types. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or code injection. The code appears well-structured, readable, and standard for error handling in Python. No evidence of malicious or sabotage intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely defines exception classes for a dependency injection library with no malicious or suspicious behaviors detected. It does not perform any network activity, data collection, or code execution beyond standard exception messaging.",
