      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured dependency injection utility with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The main security consideration is the execution of user-provided functions, which is inherent to such frameworks and not indicative of malicious intent. The existing security scores are appropriate and justified."

The scores across reports are consistent and appropriate, with malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk (~0.1). It poses minimal security concerns and is suitable for use in secure environments."

      "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, standard dependency injection container that employs reflection for dependency resolution. There are no signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation. The reflection-based design introduces minimal risk when inputs are trusted, and no external malicious data is evident. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use in dependency management scenarios."
