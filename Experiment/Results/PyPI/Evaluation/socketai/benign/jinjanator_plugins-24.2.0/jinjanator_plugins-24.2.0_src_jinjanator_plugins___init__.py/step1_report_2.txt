{
  "purpose": "This code defines protocols, exception classes, type aliases, and plugin hook specifications for a plugin-based system related to format parsing and extension management.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (collections.abc, typing), pluggy module, and typing_extensions. Class and function definitions with no external data input.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data. No network operations, file I/O, or command execution observed.",
  "flows": "Not applicable—there are no data flow paths involving untrusted input; code primarily establishes class structures and type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily declares classes, exceptions, type aliases, and plugin hook specifications using the 'pluggy' framework. It defines protocol classes for formats and plugin hooks, with no data processing, input handling, or output generation. No external data is read or written. No code injection, system commands, network access, or data leakage mechanisms are present. The design is consistent with a modular plugin system setup, and all components appear to serve configuration and extensibility purposes without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured setup for a plugin architecture using 'pluggy'. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this module. It functions as a foundational interface and exception framework for a larger plugin system.",
