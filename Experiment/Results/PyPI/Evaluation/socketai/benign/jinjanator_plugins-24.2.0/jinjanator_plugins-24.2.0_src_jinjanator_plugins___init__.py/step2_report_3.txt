  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines protocols, exceptions, and type aliases for a plugin system related to format handling. No external data handling, network calls, or suspicious code. The code is purely structural.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n  Justified: No malicious behavior or code execution present.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n  Justified: Clear, straightforward code.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1  \n  Justified: Very low, as it’s just interface setup.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it emphasizes the code's role in establishing plugin interfaces and error handling, with no external data processing or malicious activity.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n  Justified.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n  Justified.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0  \n  Justified: No security risk.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code sets up plugin hook specifications and error classes, with no external data handling or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n  Justified.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n  Justified.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0  \n  Justified.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, focusing on plugin interfaces and error handling, no external data or malicious activity.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n  Justified.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n  Justified.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0  \n  Justified.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a structural plugin interface setup with no external data processing or malicious code.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n  Justified.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n  Justified.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1  \n  Slightly higher, but still very low. The code is purely structural.\n\n**Assessment:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify zero malware risk. The code is purely structural and interface-defining.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports agree on zero obfuscation; the code is clear.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Very low (0.1) across all reports, justified by the fact that this code is a framework setup with no external data handling or execution.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\nGiven the detailed analysis, I concur with the assessments that:\n\n- **Malware risk is negligible (0).**  \n- **Obfuscation is absent (0).**  \n- **Security risk remains minimal (around 0.1),** mainly because this is just interface and protocol definitions, not executable logic.\n\n**Therefore, my final estimates are:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.1\n\nThis code appears to be a standard, well-structured plugin interface setup with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
