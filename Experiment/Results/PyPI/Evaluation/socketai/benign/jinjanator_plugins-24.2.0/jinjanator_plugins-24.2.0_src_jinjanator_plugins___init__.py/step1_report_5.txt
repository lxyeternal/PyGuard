{
  "purpose": "This code defines interfaces, exceptions, and plugin hook specifications for a plugin system, likely related to data formatting and plugin management.",
  "sources": "The code reads type annotations, class definitions, exception constructors, and plugin hook specifications; no external input data or user input is read.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or where data could be leaked or manipulated.",
  "flows": "The code primarily defines static method signatures and type annotations; there are no data flows from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, such as dynamic execution, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic, are present. The exception classes are straightforward. The use of 'cast' for plugin markers is standard for plugin systems. No suspicious external network activity or backdoors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type-safe definitions and plugin hook interfaces using the 'pluggy' library. It includes custom exception classes for format options, which handle error messages related to format options. The plugin system is set up with clear interface protocols for plugins to implement various functions. The use of 'cast' to assign plugin hook implementations appears standard. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security flaws. The code does not process untrusted input, perform external communications, or include obfuscated logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a well-structured plugin interface setup with no malicious intent, no suspicious data handling, or security vulnerabilities. It serves as an API scaffold for plugin development with no signs of malware or security risks.",
