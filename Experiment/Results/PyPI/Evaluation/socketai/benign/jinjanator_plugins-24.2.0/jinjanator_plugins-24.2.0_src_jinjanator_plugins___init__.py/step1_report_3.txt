  "purpose": "Defines interfaces, exceptions, and hook markers for a plugin system related to file formats, filters, globals, tests, and extensions, using pluggy for plugin management.",
  "sources": "Imports external libraries (collections.abc, typing, pluggy, typing_extensions). Class and function definitions that set up plugin interface and error handling.",
  "sinks": "None present. No data from external sources is read or transmitted.",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. Code appears to establish plugin system interfaces, error classes, and type aliases without executing any malicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines protocols for format handling and plugin interfaces, along with custom exceptions for format options. It utilizes pluggy markers to declare hook specifications and hook implementations for plugin features such as identity, formats, filters, globals, tests, and extensions. No external input handling, network activity, or system modifications are present. The code is purely structural and interface-oriented, with no execution of external commands or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup for a plugin architecture using pluggy, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It does not perform any data processing, network operations, or system modifications. The code is safe from a security perspective.",
