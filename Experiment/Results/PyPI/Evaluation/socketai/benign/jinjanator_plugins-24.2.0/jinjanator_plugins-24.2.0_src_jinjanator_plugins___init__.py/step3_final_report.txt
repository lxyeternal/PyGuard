{
  "purpose": "Defines plugin interface protocols, exceptions, and type aliases for a plugin system using 'pluggy'. No external data handling or malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Type alias definitions, protocol classes, exception classes, and 'pluggy' hook marker applications.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input, output, or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; code is static definitions and markers, no data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution; straightforward structure.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of interface definitions, custom exceptions, and plugin hook specifications. It uses standard 'pluggy' markers and type annotations. No external data processing, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The code is purely structural, serving as scaffolding for plugin registration and protocol enforcement. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the code's nature, reflecting a minimal security risk due to its role as a plugin interface framework.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured plugin interface setup with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and justified.",
