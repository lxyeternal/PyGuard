  "purpose": "Define protocol interfaces, custom exceptions, type aliases, and hooks for a plugin system related to format handling, filtering, and extension management in a Python application.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class definitions, exception initializations, and type alias declarations.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external input/output operations are evident.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks is detected.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code mostly consists of interface definitions, type annotations, and straightforward class implementations.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily composed of class and protocol definitions to establish expected interfaces for plugins, format handlers, and exceptions for error handling. Usage of 'cast' with 'pluggy' markers appears to be standard for plugin registration. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or handling of sensitive data that could indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic are present. The code is clean, structured, and appears to serve as a framework component.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured plugin interface setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not process external data or execute any risky operations. It is safe for use in a larger application context.",
