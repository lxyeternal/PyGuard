  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: presence of malicious code, logical flaws, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary**: The code is mainly interface definitions, custom exceptions, and plugin hook specifications. No external data handling, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The analysis states the code is standard, well-structured, and free of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — aligns with the absence of any malicious activity.\n\n- **Risk Score**: 0.1 — minimal, given that the code is purely structural.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n\n**Assessment**: The report's conclusion and scores seem reasonable. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code defines protocols, exceptions, and plugin hooks without external data handling or malicious intent.\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — no signs of malware.\n\n- **Risk Score**: 0 — no significant security risk.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — straightforward code.\n\n**Assessment**: The reasoning is consistent. The code is purely structural, with no suspicious elements.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary**: Again, the code sets up plugin interfaces and exceptions, with no external data processing or malicious activity.\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Risk Score**: 0 — no security concerns.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — clear, standard code.\n\n**Assessment**: The report's conclusion aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar observations; no external data handling, no malicious activity, purely interface definitions.\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — no malware.\n\n- **Risk Score**: 0 — minimal security risk.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — no obfuscation.\n\n**Assessment**: Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary**: Same as others; no external data, no malicious logic, well-structured.\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — no malware.\n\n- **Risk Score**: 0.1 — very low, justified by the structural nature.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — no obfuscation.\n\n**Assessment**: Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware Scores**: All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated Scores**: All are 0, consistent with the straightforward, well-structured code.\n\n- **Risk Scores**: Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports, justified by the fact that this code could be part of a larger system. However, on its own, it's low risk.\n\n### Overall Recommendation:\n\n- The scores across all reports are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n- The code appears to be a standard plugin interface setup with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimate**:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** (clear, non-obfuscated code)\n\n- **Risk Score**: **0.1** (minimal, justified by the structural role, but no active risk)\n\nThis thorough review confirms the code's safety and correctness within its intended scope.",
