{
  "purpose": "Define interfaces, exceptions, and type aliases for plugin system and format handling in a Python application, facilitating extension and customization.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, third-party 'pluggy', and type annotations; class and function definitions within the code.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flows from untrusted sources or external inputs within this code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code mainly defines types, protocols, and exceptions without processing external or untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; use of 'cast' with 'pluggy' markers appears standard for plugin registration. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a set of protocols and type aliases for a plugin system, utilizing 'pluggy' for hook implementations. Custom exception classes manage errors related to format options. The use of 'cast' and 'TypeAlias' is consistent with typical plugin architecture design. No suspicious logic, data leakage, or malicious constructs are present. The code primarily provides structural scaffolding for plugins and formats, without processing external data or executing untrusted code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup for a plugin system and format handling, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be well-structured, focusing on interface definitions rather than data processing or external interactions.",
