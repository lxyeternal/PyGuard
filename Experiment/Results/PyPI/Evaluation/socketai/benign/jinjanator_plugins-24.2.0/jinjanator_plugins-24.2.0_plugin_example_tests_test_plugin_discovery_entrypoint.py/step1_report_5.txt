  "purpose": "Unit tests for the jinjanator plugin system, verifying hook calls and plugin behaviors.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (pluggy, pytest), loads plugin entry points, and calls plugin hook functions.",
  "sinks": "Assertions and iteration over plugin hook outputs; no data sinks involving untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Imports -> plugin hook calls -> iteration -> assertions",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The code is standard test code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary testing libraries and plugin modules, sets up a plugin manager, and performs multiple tests on plugin hooks by iterating over results and asserting expected values. There are no signs of malicious data handling, code injection, or hidden behaviors. All operations are standard unit testing procedures without suspicious patterns or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward test suite for plugin hook interfaces with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a normal, safe testing script.",
