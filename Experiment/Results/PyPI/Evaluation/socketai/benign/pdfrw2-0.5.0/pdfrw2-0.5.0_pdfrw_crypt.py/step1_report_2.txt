  "purpose": "The code implements PDF encryption and decryption mechanisms, including password hashing, RC4 and AES decryption, and object stream decryption within PDF files.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include password inputs, document encryption parameters, object streams, and cryptographic key material.",
  "sinks": "Decryption functions process potentially untrusted stream data; the decryption keys are derived from user passwords and document parameters.",
  "flows": "Input password and document parameters -> create cryptographic keys -> decrypt stream objects -> output decrypted data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The code performs standard cryptographic operations consistent with PDF security standards.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly implements standard PDF encryption/decryption algorithms: MD5 hashing, RC4, AES, and key derivation per PDF specs. It includes functions for creating user hashes, checking passwords, and decrypting stream objects. The cryptographic operations depend on user-provided passwords and document parameters, with no indications of malicious data handling or hidden backdoors. The presence of cryptographic libraries is conditional, based on availability. No suspicious behavior or malicious payloads are present; all functions perform expected cryptographic tasks. The code appears legitimate and consistent with open-source PDF encryption implementations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of PDF encryption/decryption routines with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It performs legitimate cryptographic operations for PDF security. No malware or security risks are identified.",
