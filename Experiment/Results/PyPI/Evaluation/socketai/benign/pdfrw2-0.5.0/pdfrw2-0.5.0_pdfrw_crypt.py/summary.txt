  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of PDF encryption and decryption routines, with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. The low security risk score reflects the inherent sensitivity of cryptographic code but does not indicate vulnerabilities. The malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate. Overall, the code appears safe and compliant with PDF standards."
