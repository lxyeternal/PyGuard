  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the pdfrw library, defining metadata and reading the README file.",
  "sources": "Reading the README file via open() and importing version info from pdfrw.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static package metadata definition.",
  "flows": "Importing version info -> reading README file -> setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() without a context manager, which is common in setup scripts but not ideal.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script that imports version info, reads a static README file, and calls setup() with package metadata. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is present. The only minor concern is the open() call without a context manager, which does not pose a security risk. No obfuscation or malicious code is detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign setup script with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The minor file handling concern does not elevate the security risk. Overall, the package is safe for use.",
