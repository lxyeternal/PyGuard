  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code, and evaluate the reasoning, scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script is a standard setup script, no malicious activity detected.\n- **Code analysis:** Confirms that the code only reads static files and imports version info. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or untrusted input processing.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is benign, and the score aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with minor concern about open() without a context manager.\n- **Code analysis:** Uses open() without a context manager, which is a minor code quality concern but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The minor risk score of 0.1 is appropriate; the reasoning is correct. No malicious activity is implied.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard setup script, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Code analysis:** Reads a local README file; no external or untrusted data processing.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is accurate. The code is typical and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Typical packaging script, no malicious activity.\n- **Code analysis:** Same as above, straightforward setup script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard setup script, no suspicious activity.\n- **Code analysis:** Same as above, no dynamic or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no indication of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, consistent with straightforward, readable code.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly elevated (0.1) in Report 2 due to open() without a context manager, which is a minor concern but not malicious.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\nGiven the uniformity and the nature of the code, I agree with the scores assigned. The only point of slight concern is the open() call without a context manager, but this is standard in many setup scripts and does not constitute a security risk.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.05 (a very minor concern, but negligible in practice)\n\nThe code is benign, straightforward, and adheres to typical packaging conventions.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate. The code is safe, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The risk is minimal and primarily related to minor coding style rather than security.",
