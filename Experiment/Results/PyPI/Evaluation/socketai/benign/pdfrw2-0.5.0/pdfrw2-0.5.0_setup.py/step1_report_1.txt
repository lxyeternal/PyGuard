{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the pdfrw2 Python package, used for packaging and distribution of a PDF manipulation library.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.rst file via open() for long_description.",
  "sinks": "None detected that would process untrusted input directly; the code primarily loads static package metadata.",
  "flows": "open() reads static file content for long_description; no user input or external untrusted data flows into security-sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() with a hardcoded filename 'README.rst' is standard for setup scripts; no suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a typical setup configuration for a Python package, importing version info from a package module and reading a README file for description. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or handling of untrusted input is present. The only file access is reading a static README file. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious behavior, or obfuscated code are detected. The package appears to be a legitimate setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign setup script for a Python package. No malicious activity, malicious code, or security risks are detected.",
