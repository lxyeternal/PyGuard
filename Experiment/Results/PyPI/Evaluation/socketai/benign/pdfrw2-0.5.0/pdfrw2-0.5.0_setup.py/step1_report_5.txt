  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no external data or untrusted input handling.",
  "flows": "Reading README.rst content during setup for long_description; no flow of untrusted data to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration for packaging a Python library. It imports version info from the pdfrw package and loads the README file content for the long description. The code uses well-known setup parameters without any dynamic or untrusted code execution, no network activity, or credential handling. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are detected. The code structure is typical and straightforward for a Python package setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a normal setup script for packaging the pdfrw library, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
