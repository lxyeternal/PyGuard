{
  "purpose": "This module provides functions for finding, wrapping, and processing PDF XObjects, specifically Form and Image types, for manipulation or rendering.",
  "sources": "Input can come from a PdfDict or iterable source containing PDF objects, which are processed in find_objects and page_per_xobj functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential untrusted data outputs are the wrapped PDF page objects created in wrap_object and yielded in page_per_xobj, which could be embedded or rendered.",
  "flows": "Data flows from source input into find_objects to identify relevant objects, then into wrap_object to create page objects, and finally to output via generators.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected. The code performs standard PDF object processing. The use of eval-like dynamic attribute access and generator expressions is typical for PDF parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically traverses PDF object structures without recursion, identifying XObjects of type Form or Image. It filters objects based on their Type and Subtype, and wraps them into page objects. The function trivial_xobjs attempts to filter trivial XObjects based on stream content, using string analysis to detect simple or empty streams. No external network calls, system modifications, or suspicious behavior are evident. All functions operate on PDF data structures, and there are no signs of malicious data exfiltration, code injection, or covert channels.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for processing PDF XObjects, with no malicious intent or malicious behavior detected. It performs standard PDF object traversal and manipulation, with safeguards against infinite loops and trivial object filtering. No malware or security risks are identified.",
