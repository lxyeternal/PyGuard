{
  "purpose": "This module provides functions for finding, wrapping, and processing PDF XObjects (such as images and form objects) within a PDF document.",
  "sources": "The code reads PDF object data from provided source objects, primarily through the find_objects() generator, which traverses PDF dictionaries and arrays.",
  "sinks": "The wrap_object() function writes to PdfDict objects, potentially creating new PDF pages or object streams. No direct data leaks or network communications are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from source PDF objects into internal functions like find_objects(), which identify specific object types, then into wrap_object() to generate new wrapped page objects, and finally into page_per_xobj() to yield pages per object.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are evident. The code is straightforward for processing PDF objects. The trivial_xobjs() function analyzes streams but only to determine triviality, not for malicious purposes. No obfuscation or unusual control flow detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard PDF object traversal and manipulation without any external network activity or system modifications. It uses common Python idioms and safe operations. The only noteworthy aspect is the analysis of stream content in trivial_xobjs(), which appears to be a benign heuristic for identifying trivial XObjects. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. All functions operate within the expected scope of PDF processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate PDF processing utility for extracting and wrapping XObjects. No malicious intent or security risks are evident. It functions as intended for PDF manipulation without any signs of malware or security issues.",
