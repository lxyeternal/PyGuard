{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to find specific XObjects (Form and Image) within PDF documents and wrap them into page objects for further processing or rendering.",
  "sources": "It reads PDF object dictionaries, arrays, streams, and resource dictionaries to identify relevant XObjects.",
  "sinks": "Creates new PDF page objects with resources and content streams, potentially exposing the data for rendering.",
  "flows": "Source data (PDF objects/streams) is traversed, filtered, and then used to generate wrapped page objects; no external data flow or network activity occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present. The heuristic in `trivial_xobjs()` is benign and intended for filtering trivial XObjects.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard PDF object traversal and wrapping. It avoids recursion for efficiency, handles different object types, and constructs new page objects with appropriate resources. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is evident. The stream processing and heuristic filtering are typical for PDF utilities and do not indicate malicious intent. The code's logic is straightforward, and no external communication or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a legitimate, standard PDF utility for handling XObjects. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The low security risk score reflects the potential for maliciously crafted PDFs but does not indicate active threats. The scores are consistent with the code's functionality and the reports' assessments.",
