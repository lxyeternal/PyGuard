{
  "purpose": "The module provides functions for locating specific XObject types within PDF documents and wrapping these objects into page objects, primarily for manipulation or rendering purposes.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from PDF object dictionaries, arrays, or sources passed to find_objects and page_per_xobj functions.",
  "sinks": "Generated PDF page objects, including manipulated streams and resource dictionaries, potentially used for rendering or saving modified PDFs.",
  "flows": "find_objects reads PDF structures; wrap_object creates new PDF page objects; page_per_xobj processes XObjects and outputs wrapped pages.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not include hardcoded secrets or typical malicious indicators; it straightforwardly manipulates PDF objects. The ignore function uses simplistic stream analysis which could be exploited if streams are maliciously crafted, but no active malicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a PDF processing utility for locating and wrapping XObjects such as images and forms within a PDF. It uses standard Python features and straightforward PDF structure traversal. There are no suspicious external network calls, hidden backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The only potential concern is the stream analysis in trivial_xobjs, which performs simplistic string parsing—this is not malicious but could be misused if input streams are maliciously crafted to cause performance issues or false positives. No code injection, credential handling, or external communication is present. The code appears to be safe and intended solely for PDF manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign PDF utility module with no malicious intent or behavior. It performs standard PDF object processing and wrapping without any suspicious or harmful actions.",
