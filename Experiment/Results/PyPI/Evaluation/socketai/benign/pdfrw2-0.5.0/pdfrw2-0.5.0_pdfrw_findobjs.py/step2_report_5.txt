  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard PDF object traversal and filtering.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Creates PDF page objects; no external communication.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious patterns; streams could be crafted maliciously but this is typical.\n- **Analysis:** Legitimate PDF utility, no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 seem reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing straightforward PDF object processing.\n- No suspicious code or network activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 are appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on safe traversal and manipulation.\n- No external or malicious activity; stream analysis is benign heuristic.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 seem justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Standard PDF object handling; no malicious indicators.\n- Constructing new PDF objects is typical.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 are consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar findings; no malicious activity.\n- Stream analysis is benign heuristic.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's nature—standard PDF processing functions without any malicious payloads or behaviors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, which is correct; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above 0.1 in most cases, around 0.2, reflecting minimal inherent risk in processing untrusted PDF streams, but no active malicious behavior.\n\n**Given the analysis:**\n- The code is a standard, legitimate PDF utility module.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Overall malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected).\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear code).\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** (low, due to potential risks in processing maliciously crafted streams, but no active threat).\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis assessment aligns with the reports and the code's functionality.",
