  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions and set up logging for error handling in the pdfrw library.",
  "sources": "Importing the logging module; no external input sources are used in this code.",
  "sinks": "Logging outputs, which are configured to output to standard stream (console). No untrusted data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; logging configuration is static.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present. The logging setup is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a logging configuration and defines custom exception classes for the pdfrw library. It does not process user input, read files, or handle data that could lead to security issues. No suspicious behaviors or malicious actions are evident. The exception classes are straightforward, inheriting from Exception with no additional logic. The logging setup uses standard formatter and stream handler to output warnings and above. Overall, the code is typical for setting up error handling and logging in a Python module.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is a standard setup for logging and exception handling with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
