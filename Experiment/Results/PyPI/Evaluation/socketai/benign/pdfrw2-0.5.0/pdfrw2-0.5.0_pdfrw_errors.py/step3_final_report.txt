  "purpose": "Setup for logging and defining custom exception classes for PDF processing errors",
  "sources": "No external data sources; code defines classes and logging configuration",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data handling or external communication",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow; code only sets up classes and logging",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions and logging setup",
  "analysis": "The code configures logging with a specific format and level, then defines several custom exception classes inheriting from Exception. It contains no input/output operations, network activity, data processing, or dynamic code execution. The code is clear, standard, and typical for error handling in a Python library. No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, all consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup for logging and exception handling in a Python library, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
