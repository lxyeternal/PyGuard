{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes and sets up logging for error handling in the pdfrw PDF processing library.",
  "sources": "Logging configuration and import statements at the beginning of the code.",
  "sinks": "Logging output stream (StreamHandler) that outputs formatted logs.",
  "flows": "Logging configuration flows from import to log setup, no external data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior; code is straightforward and typical for logging setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the logging module, configures a formatter, a stream handler, and attaches it to a logger named 'pdfrw'. It then defines several custom exception classes for various PDF errors. There are no data leaks, external connections, or malicious constructs. The code is standard for error handling and logging setup, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging and exception setup for a PDF processing library, with no malicious or suspicious elements identified. It performs expected error handling tasks without any malicious behavior.",
