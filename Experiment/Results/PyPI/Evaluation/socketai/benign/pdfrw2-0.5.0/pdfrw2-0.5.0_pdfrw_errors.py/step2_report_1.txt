  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checkting the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward setup: configuring logging and defining custom exception classes.\n- No input/output operations, network activity, or data handling that could introduce security vulnerabilities.\n- No obfuscated code, no suspicious constructs, and no external data sources or sinks.\n- All reports consistently identify the code as standard, benign, and typical for error handling in a Python library.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** The code does **not** contain any issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior.\n- **Malware:** Score of 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated:** Score of 0 is correct; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** Overall, the code presents no security risk; a score of 0 is justified.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are present in the code or the reports.\n- The reasoning in all reports is consistent and accurate.\n\n### Score assessments:\n- The **malware score** is 0 in all reports, which is correct.\n- The **obfuscated score** is 0, also correct.\n- The **security risk** score is 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- Since no suspicious or malicious activity is present, scores higher than 0.5 are unwarranted.\n- The reports correctly assign a score of 0 for malware and obfuscated code, and 0 for security risk.\n\n### Potential discrepancies:\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code, and their reasoning is sound.\n- No adjustments needed; the scoring is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores based on the code and reports:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — No malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk:** 0 — No security risks identified.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard setup for logging and exception handling in a Python library, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is safe, standard, and contains no security concerns.  \n- The scoring is consistent and justified.  \n- No further adjustments are necessary.",
