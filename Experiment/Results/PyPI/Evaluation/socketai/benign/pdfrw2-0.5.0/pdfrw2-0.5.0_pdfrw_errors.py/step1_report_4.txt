  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes and set up logging configuration for the pdfrw library.",
  "sources": "Logging configuration setup and the import statement for the logging module.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is being written or sent to external sources.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only sets up logging and defines exception classes without data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is standard for setting up logging and custom exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the logging module, configures a logging formatter, adds a stream handler, and sets the log level to WARNING. It defines a base exception class 'PdfError' and three derived exception classes for specific PDF errors. There is no input reading, data processing, or external communication. The code appears to be a standard setup for error handling in a PDF library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical logging and exception setup with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not contain security risks or malware indicators.",
