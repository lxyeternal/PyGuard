  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions and configure logging for error handling within the pdfrw PDF processing library.",
  "sources": "None (no input reading operations or external data sources are present).",
  "sinks": "None (no data output or untrusted data handling observed).",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink; the code only sets up exception classes and logging configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; straightforward exception class definitions and logging setup.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up logging formatting and handlers, then defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for PDF processing errors. It does not perform any input/output operations, network activity, or data handling that could pose security risks. The exception classes are simple and only used for internal error handling. No obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security concerns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for error handling and logging configuration in a Python library. It does not contain malicious code, security risks, or anomalies. It appears safe and typical for its purpose.",
