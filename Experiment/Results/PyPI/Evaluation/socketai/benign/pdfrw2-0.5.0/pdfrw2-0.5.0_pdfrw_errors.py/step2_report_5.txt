  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior**:\n   - The code only sets up logging and defines custom exception classes for a PDF processing library.\n   - No input/output operations, network activity, data processing, or external data handling.\n   - No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.\n   - The exception classes inherit straightforwardly from `Exception` with no additional logic.\n\n2. **Malware & Obfuscation**:\n   - All reports correctly identify no malware or obfuscation.\n   - The code is transparent, standard, and typical for error handling in a Python library.\n\n3. **Security Risks & Anomalies**:\n   - No evidence of security vulnerabilities, data leaks, or malicious behavior.\n   - The setup is conventional and safe.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications**:\n   - **Malware score**: Consistently 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n   - **Obfuscated score**: 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - **Risk score**: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n5. **Potential Issues or Claims**:\n   - The reports do not assume or suggest any vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n   - They correctly identify the code as standard setup code.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment**:\n\n- The code is purely for error handling and logging configuration.\n- It does not perform any operations that could introduce security risks.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are reasonable and justified.\n- No changes needed; the reports' evaluations are accurate.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risks present)\n\n**Conclusion**: The code is safe, standard, and free from malicious or obfuscated content. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.",
