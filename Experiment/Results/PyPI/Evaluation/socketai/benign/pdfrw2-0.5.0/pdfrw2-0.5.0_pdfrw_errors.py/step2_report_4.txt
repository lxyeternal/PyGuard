  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports agree that the code is straightforward, consisting solely of logging setup and custom exception class definitions. There are no signs of input processing, data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. Therefore, **no issues or vulnerabilities are present** in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning**:  \n   The reports uniformly state that the code is standard, with no suspicious or malicious behavior. Their reasoning aligns with the code's simplicity. No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in their assessments.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - Obfuscated: 0\n   - Malware: 0\n   - Security Risk: 0  \n   These are appropriate given the code's nature. No changes are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since all reports indicate no malicious activity, no reason exists to assign a high risk score. The code is purely for error handling and logging, with no vulnerabilities or malware.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the code's content. No malicious behavior is present or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions. They correctly identify the code as standard setup for logging and exceptions, with no suspicious elements.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's purpose and content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Rationale**:  \nThe code is a typical logging and exception class setup, with no input/output operations, no external data handling, and no suspicious constructs. It does not perform any actions that could compromise security or contain malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**:\nThe code is benign, with no security risks or malware. The scores assigned are appropriate, and the reasoning is sound. No modifications or escalations are necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:  \n- Keep malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0.  \n- Confirm that the code is safe and free of vulnerabilities.",
