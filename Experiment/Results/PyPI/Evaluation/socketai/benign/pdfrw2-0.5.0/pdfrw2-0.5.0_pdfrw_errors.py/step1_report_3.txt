{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes and set up logging for PDF processing errors in the pdfrw library.",
  "sources": "The code reads import statements, logging configuration, and exception class definitions; no external input or untrusted data sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling points that process untrusted data or could lead to data leakage or malicious activity.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely defines classes and sets up logging configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code appears to be standard error handling and logging setup without suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the logging module, configures a formatter and handler, and creates custom exception classes inheriting from Exception. No external inputs, user data, or untrusted sources are processed. The code does not perform network operations, execute dynamic code, or access sensitive data. It solely establishes error classes and logging configuration relevant to a PDF library. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward setup for error handling and logging in the pdfrw library. It contains no malicious intent, no suspicious behaviors, and no security vulnerabilities. The likelihood of malicious behavior is very low.",
