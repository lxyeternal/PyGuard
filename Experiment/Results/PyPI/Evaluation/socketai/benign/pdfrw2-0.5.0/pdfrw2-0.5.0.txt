The primary security consideration is processing untrusted PDF files, which is inherent to PDF tools but not indicative of malicious intent within this code. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting the minimal inherent risk due to external input handling."
