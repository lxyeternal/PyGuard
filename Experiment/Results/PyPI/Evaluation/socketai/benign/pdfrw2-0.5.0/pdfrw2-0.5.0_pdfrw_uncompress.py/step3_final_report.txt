  "purpose": "Implement decompression routines for PDF streams, including support for PNG prediction filters to reconstruct image data within PDFs.",
  "sources": "Reads from PdfDict stream objects, their Filter and DecodeParms attributes, and the stream data itself.",
  "sinks": "Outputs decompressed and filtered data back into the stream objects, possibly converting data formats.",
  "flows": "Source: stream objects and their parameters -> Decompression and PNG predictor functions -> Sink: updated stream data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual control flow; uses standard libraries and algorithms.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard PDF decompression with support for PNG prediction filters, implementing PNG filter algorithms (sub, up, avg, paeth). It handles errors gracefully, logs issues, and does not perform network operations or malicious actions. The use of fallback imports and data conversions are typical in such libraries. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk ~0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's purpose and implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of PDF stream decompression and PNG predictor filtering routines. There is no evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. The low security risk score reflects the processing of untrusted data but does not indicate any active threat.",
