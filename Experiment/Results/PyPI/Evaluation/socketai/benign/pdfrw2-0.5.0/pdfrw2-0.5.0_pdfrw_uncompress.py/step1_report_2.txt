{
  "purpose": "This code implements decompression filters for PDF files, specifically handling FlateDecode and PNG predictor-based decompression within PDF streams.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from PdfDict objects' stream attributes, and reads parameters from PdfDict attributes such as Filter and DecodeParms.",
  "sinks": "Data is decompressed and processed, potentially outputting uncompressed PDF stream data. No explicit data sinks like network connections or file writes are present.",
  "flows": "Source: PdfDict stream attributes and DecodeParms → Decompression functions (uncompress, flate_png) → Processing of decompressed data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. The code includes standard decompression and PNG predictor algorithms. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or stealth mechanisms are evident. Use of try-except blocks for error handling is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to decompress PDF stream objects with support for PNG predictors. It uses standard Python libraries and safe mathematical operations. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful system modifications. The code's purpose is legitimate for PDF processing. No suspicious or malicious code patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of PDF decompression filters, including PNG predictor support. It performs expected data decompression tasks without any malicious intent or malicious code patterns. No security risks or malware are detected.",
