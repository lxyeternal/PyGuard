{
  "purpose": "This code initializes the pdfrw library module by importing core components, setting version info, and defining public API exports.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (pdfwriter, pdfreader, objects, tokens, errors, pagemerge), version string, and compatibility aliases.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; the code does not process or transmit untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only sets up module exports and aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or unusual code behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module setup script, importing internal components and defining exports. It contains no dynamic execution, network activity, or data handling that could pose security risks. The structure is typical for an open-source library initialization, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a standard setup for the pdfrw library. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
