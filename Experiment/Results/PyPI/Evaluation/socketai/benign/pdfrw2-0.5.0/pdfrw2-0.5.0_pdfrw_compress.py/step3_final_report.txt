  "purpose": "Compresses PDF stream objects using zlib (flate) algorithm to reduce size.",
  "sources": "Reads stream objects from the provided list via streamobjects(), accesses obj.Filter, obj.stream, and obj.DecodeParms.",
  "sinks": "Updates obj.stream, obj.Filter, and obj.DecodeParms; potential for data leakage if stream data is sensitive, but unlikely in this context.",
  "flows": "streamobjects() -> iterates over objects -> checks obj.Filter -> compresses obj.stream -> updates obj attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward compression logic. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code iterates over PDF stream objects, compresses their stream data if not already filtered, and applies a heuristic to only replace streams if the compressed size is significantly smaller. It avoids compressing streams that won't benefit much, which is efficient. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The code uses standard libraries and practices, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of PDF stream compression with no evidence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The empty reports do not provide any issues or concerns. The overall security risk is minimal, and malware likelihood is zero.",
