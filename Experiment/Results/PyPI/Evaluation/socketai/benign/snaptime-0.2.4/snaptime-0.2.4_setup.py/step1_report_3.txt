  "purpose": "Define the package setup configuration for the 'snaptime' Python project, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Input data from setup() parameters such as name, version, description, author, URL, and install_requires.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or output untrusted data at runtime.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flows or untrusted data handling present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'distutils.core' instead of 'setuptools' is outdated but not malicious; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script that specifies package metadata and dependencies. It does not include any dynamic code execution, external data fetching, or other potentially malicious patterns. The dependencies listed are common packages related to datetime processing. No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a typical package setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It simply provides metadata and dependencies for the package distribution.",
