  "purpose": "Define package metadata and configuration for distribution of the 'snaptime' Python package.",
  "sources": "Static strings and lists defining package name, version, description, dependencies, author info, URLs, keywords, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any operations that could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration data without data flow or dynamic processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a standard setup script with no obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script using distutils to specify package metadata. It contains only static, hardcoded strings and lists, with no dynamic code, user input, network activity, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the static, transparent nature of the code. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present, and the code does not process untrusted data or contain code sinks. The use of distutils is outdated but not malicious or risky. Overall, the code is a standard, benign package configuration script with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a benign, static setup script for packaging a Python project. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements, and the scores assigned are appropriate. No modifications or further security measures are necessary.",
