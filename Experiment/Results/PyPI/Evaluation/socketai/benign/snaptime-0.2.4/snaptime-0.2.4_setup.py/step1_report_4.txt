  "purpose": "Define the package setup configuration for the 'snaptime' Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data such as package name, version, description, dependencies, author info, and URLs.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no input or data leaks are indicated.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks; the code only constructs setup metadata.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, using standard setup from distutils without any obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, importing distutils.core.setup to define package metadata and dependencies. There are no indications of malicious code, such as network activity, hidden backdoors, or data leaks. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present. The dependencies are standard and widely used. No suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign package setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
