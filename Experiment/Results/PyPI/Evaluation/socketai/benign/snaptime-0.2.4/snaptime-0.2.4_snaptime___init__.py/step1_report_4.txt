  "purpose": "Import specific functions 'snap' and 'snap_tz' from the 'snaptime.main' module, likely for use elsewhere in the project.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'snaptime.main' module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "None observable; code only performs import statements.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with an empty __all__ list and a straightforward import. No unusual language features or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets an empty __all__ list, indicating no explicit public API exports, and imports two functions from a local module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code activity. The minimal structure suggests standard module setup without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a normal module import statement with no malicious or security concerning behavior.",
