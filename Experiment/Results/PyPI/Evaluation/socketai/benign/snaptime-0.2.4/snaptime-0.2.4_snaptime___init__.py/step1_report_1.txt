  "purpose": "The code appears to be importing functions 'snap' and 'snap_tz' from the 'snaptime.main' module, likely for time-related operations.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'snap' and 'snap_tz' from 'snaptime.main'",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data or external output is present in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis needed as there is only an import statement with no further code execution",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected",
  "analysis": "This snippet sets an empty list '__all__' to control module exports, then imports specific functions from a module named 'snaptime.main'. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. The import seems legitimate and standard. The code is very simple and does not perform any actions that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, performing standard import operations with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
