  "purpose": "Minimal module setup importing functions from 'snaptime.main' with an empty __all__ list.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'snaptime.main' module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "Import from 'snaptime.main' as the only source; no data flow leading to security impact.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual but benign setting of '__all__ = []', no malicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module with an empty export list and a simple import statement. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The import is from a known module, and the code does not perform any operations that could lead to data leakage or system compromise. The only minor anomaly is the empty '__all__', which is not malicious but somewhat atypical in minimal modules. Overall, the code is benign, and the risk is negligible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The assessments in the reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
