{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific functions from a module, likely to be used elsewhere in the project.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing functions 'snap' and 'snap_tz' from 'snaptime.main'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data sources or sinks are evident in this minimal code.",
  "anomalies": "Empty __all__ list; no anomalies present. The import appears standard without any obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an empty '__all__' list, which typically controls module exports. It then imports two functions from 'snaptime.main'. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious code, or data leakage. The code is minimal, straightforward, and standard in structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and standard, with no malicious intent or security issues detected based on this snippet. It likely prepares for module exports and imports necessary functions without any suspicious activity.",
