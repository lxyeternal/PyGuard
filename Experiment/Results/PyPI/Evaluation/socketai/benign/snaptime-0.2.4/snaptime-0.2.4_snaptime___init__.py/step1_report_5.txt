{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up an empty list and import functions 'snap' and 'snap_tz' from the 'snaptime.main' module, likely for later use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'snaptime.main' module.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no data is processed or transmitted in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are observable in this minimal code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hardcoded secrets are evident in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes an empty list '__all__' which is standard for defining module exports. It then imports two functions from a third-party or local module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation. The imported functions' implementations are not shown, so potential malicious activity cannot be assessed further, but based solely on this snippet, nothing suspicious is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is straightforward, with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger module setup, possibly for exporting or using 'snap' and 'snap_tz' functions later. No malicious or security concerns are identified in this minimal code.",
