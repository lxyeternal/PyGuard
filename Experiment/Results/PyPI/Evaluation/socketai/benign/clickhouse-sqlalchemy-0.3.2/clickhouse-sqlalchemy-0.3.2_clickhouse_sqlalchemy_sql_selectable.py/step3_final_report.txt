  "purpose": "Extension of SQLAlchemy's Select class to support advanced SQL clauses such as cube, rollup, totals, sample, limit_by, and array joins, facilitating complex query construction.",
  "sources": "External functions and classes like sample_clause, LimitByClause, ArrayJoin, LeftArrayJoin, and the imported StandardSelect, which are used to set internal clause attributes.",
  "sinks": "Internal attribute assignments and clause object creations; no direct data leaks or external code execution observed.",
  "flows": "Method calls modify internal state or create clause objects based on input parameters; no untrusted data flows into dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected; code is straightforward and standard for extending SQLAlchemy.",
  "analysis": "The code extends SQLAlchemy's Select class with additional methods for complex SQL features, using decorators to support method chaining. It stores clause parameters internally, which are likely used during query compilation. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. External functions like sample_clause and LimitByClause are invoked with user-provided data, but their implementation is unknown; potential security issues depend on their sanitization. Overall, the code is a benign extension with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard extension of SQLAlchemy's query builder, adding syntactic sugar for complex SQL clauses. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The primary security consideration is ensuring external clause functions are implemented securely. Scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) due to external functions.",
