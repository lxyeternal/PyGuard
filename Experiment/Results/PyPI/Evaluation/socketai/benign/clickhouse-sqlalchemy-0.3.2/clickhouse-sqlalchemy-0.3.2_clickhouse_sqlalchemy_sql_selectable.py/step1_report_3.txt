{
  "purpose": "This code defines a custom subclass of SQLAlchemy's Select class with additional methods for advanced SQL query modifications, including cube, rollup, totals, sampling, limit-by, and array joins.",
  "sources": "Method inputs such as 'sample' parameter in sample(), 'by_clauses', 'limit', 'offset' in limit_by(), and *columns in array_join() and left_array_join().",
  "sinks": "Assignment to internal attributes (e.g., self._sample_clause, self._limit_by_clause, self._array_join). No direct external data sinks like network, file, or environment variables are used.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are stored into class attributes for later use in query construction. No dynamic code execution or untrusted data flows to external systems are detected.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic are present. Use of standard SQLAlchemy methods and custom attributes is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code extends SQLAlchemy's Select class with additional query clauses, providing methods to set various SQL options via attribute assignments. Methods are designed to modify internal state with no apparent external data leaks or malicious side effects. No input data is used insecurely, and no untrusted data flows into critical operations or external systems. The code appears to be a legitimate extension for SQL query building with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, straightforward extension of SQLAlchemy's query builder. It contains no malware, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It appears to be intended for enhancing SQL query capabilities without introducing vulnerabilities.",
