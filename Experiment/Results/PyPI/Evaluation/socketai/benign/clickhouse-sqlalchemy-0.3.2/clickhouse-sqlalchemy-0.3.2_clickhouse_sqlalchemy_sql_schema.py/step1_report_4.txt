  "purpose": "Define custom table and materialized view classes for SQLAlchemy with extended functionality.",
  "sources": "Import statements for SQLAlchemy modules, class initializations, property accesses, method calls such as bind and create/drop.",
  "sinks": "Method calls to bind._run_ddl_visitor with schema manipulation classes, attribute accesses for inner_table and metadata, potential SQL command generation.",
  "flows": "Initialization and method calls on class instances lead to execution of _run_ddl_visitor which may generate DDL statements.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Use of internal methods like _run_ddl_visitor could be sensitive if malicious DDL objects are used, but the code itself is standard extension of SQLAlchemy classes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines extended classes for tables and materialized views, mainly wrapping SQLAlchemy functionality. It manipulates metadata and invokes schema DDL visitors for create/drop operations. No untrusted data input, no network activity, no suspicious code patterns. Use of internal methods (_run_ddl_visitor) is standard within the SQLAlchemy extension context, but could be malicious if malicious DDL objects are passed externally; however, in normal usage, this is controlled. No obfuscated code or hidden logic is present. The overall structure appears to be standard extension and manipulation of SQLAlchemy constructs, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard extension of SQLAlchemy classes for custom table and materialized view handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It simply manipulates schema objects and calls known methods for schema changes. No immediate security risks are identified.",
