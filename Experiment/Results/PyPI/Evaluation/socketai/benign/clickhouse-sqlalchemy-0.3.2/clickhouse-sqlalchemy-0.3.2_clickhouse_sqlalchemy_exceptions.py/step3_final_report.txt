{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class 'DatabaseException' that wraps an original exception and provides a formatted string representation.",
  "sources": "The class stores an exception object 'orig' passed during initialization.",
  "sinks": "The __str__ method formats and outputs the stored exception; no external data sinks or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Input: exception object 'orig' during instantiation. Output: formatted string including 'orig' when __str__ is called.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, standard custom exception class for wrapping database errors. It stores an original exception and customizes its string output. No data sources, sinks, or external communications are involved. The code does not perform any malicious actions, obfuscation, or security-sensitive operations. The purpose is clear and typical for exception handling. All scores (malware, obfuscated, security risk) are appropriately set to 0, reflecting the benign nature. The logic is sound, and the code is free of vulnerabilities or malicious intent. The reports' assessments are consistent and justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward custom exception class with no security risks or malicious behavior. The scores assigned are accurate and should remain as is.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
