  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for database-related errors.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; only class definition.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external communication; no vulnerable code paths.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only class and method definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of Exception named DatabaseException, which captures an original exception and overrides the __str__ method for custom messaging. It is straightforward and does not include any suspicious or malicious logic, external data handling, or security-sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign custom exception class for database errors with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
