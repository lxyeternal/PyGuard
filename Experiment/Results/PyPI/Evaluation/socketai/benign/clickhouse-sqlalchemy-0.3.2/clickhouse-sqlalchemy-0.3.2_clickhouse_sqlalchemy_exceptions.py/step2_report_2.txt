  "review": "Let's systematically analyze the provided reports and the original code to verify the claims, evaluate the scoring, and identify any inconsistencies or overlooked issues.\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Code Flaws:**\n   - The original code is a simple custom exception class that wraps an original exception and customizes its string output.\n   - All reports agree that the code is straightforward, with no data sources, sinks, or external interactions.\n   - No evidence of obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious intent is present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports consistently conclude the code is benign and standard.\n   - No logical errors or flaws are identified.\n   - The reasoning is sound; the code's purpose is clear and typical.\n\n3. **Scores Given and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n     - obfuscated: 0 (not obfuscated)\n     - malware: 0 (no malware)\n     - securityRisk: 0 (no security risk)\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and the absence of suspicious behavior.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is benign, the risk score of 0 is justified.\n   - No reason to assign higher risk scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, aligning with the analysis.\n   - No malicious activity detected.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions or Unsubstantiated Concerns:**\n   - All reports avoid making unfounded assumptions.\n   - They correctly interpret the code as a benign exception class.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis.\n   - No discrepancies observed.\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**\n- The code is a straightforward, standard custom exception class.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behavior is present.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- I agree with the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is benign and does not pose any security concerns.",
