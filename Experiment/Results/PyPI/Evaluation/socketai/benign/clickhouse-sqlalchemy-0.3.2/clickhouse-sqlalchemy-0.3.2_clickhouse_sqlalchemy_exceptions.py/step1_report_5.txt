  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for database-related errors.",
  "sources": "The class takes an original exception as input and stores it.",
  "sinks": "The __str__ method formats the exception message; no untrusted data handling or external calls.",
  "flows": "Input exception -> stored in self.orig -> displayed via __str__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard exception wrapping.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class 'DatabaseException' that extends Python's built-in Exception. It stores an original exception object passed during initialization and customizes the string representation to include the original exception message. There are no external data sources, network calls, or suspicious patterns. The code appears to serve a typical error-handling purpose with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign custom exception class with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
