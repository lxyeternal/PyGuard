  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for database-related errors",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations present",
  "sinks": "No output or data handling operations present",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths in the code",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to be a straightforward custom exception class with no suspicious elements",
  "analysis": "The class 'DatabaseException' extends Python's Exception class, storing an original exception and customizing the string representation. There are no signs of data leaks, malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs. The code's purpose is to encapsulate database error information for exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a custom exception class with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs a typical task of wrapping an original exception for better error handling.",
