  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for database-related errors.",
  "sources": "No input reading; the class is solely defining behavior.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output sinks present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only defines a class without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple custom exception class inheriting from Exception, with an initializer that stores the original exception and a string representation method. There are no data inputs, external calls, or risky behavior. The code appears straightforward and typical for exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard custom exception class with no malicious intent, no anomalies, and no security risks detected.",
