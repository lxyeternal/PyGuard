  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a simple, standard custom exception class (`DatabaseException`) that wraps an original exception and provides a custom string representation.\n   - The code does not read input, write output, handle untrusted data, or perform any external communication.\n   - There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n   - **Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code; it is benign.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is straightforward and typical for exception handling.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - **Conclusion:** The reports are accurate; no flaws are detected.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Suggestion:** No score adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - The highest risk score assigned is 0, which is correct.\n   - No reason exists to assign a higher risk score since there's no malicious activity or security concern.\n   - **Conclusion:** The risk scores are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n   - **Conclusion:** Malware score is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n   - **Conclusion:** The analysis is sound.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - All scores are consistent across reports.\n   - The overall assessment aligns with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Overall, the code is a benign, standard custom exception class with no security issues or malicious intent.**",
