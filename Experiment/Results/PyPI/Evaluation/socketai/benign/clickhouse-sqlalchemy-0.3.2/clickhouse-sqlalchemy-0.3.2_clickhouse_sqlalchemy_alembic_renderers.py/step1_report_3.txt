{
  "purpose": "The code provides custom rendering functions for Alembic migration operations related to materialized views, formatting SQL commands with proper escaping and structure.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from 'op' objects (e.g., op.name, op.selectable, op.engine, op.columns, op.inner_name) and the autogen_context for prefixing.",
  "sinks": "The formatted strings are returned as SQL command strings, which could be executed in the database context.",
  "flows": "Input data from 'op' objects is escaped and formatted into SQL command strings, which are then returned for execution or further processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors detected. Usage of escape functions is standard for SQL string safety. No external network calls, system modifications, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines rendering functions for creating and dropping materialized views, attaching and detaching them, using standard string formatting and escaping. The functions process input 'operation' objects to generate SQL commands. The escape function escapes single quotes in input strings to prevent SQL injection. All data flows are into string templates meant for database commands. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code's structure is straightforward, and the context suggests it's used for database migrations, with no suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate rendering functions for database migration operations involving materialized views. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks identified. It uses standard practices for SQL string construction and escaping.",
