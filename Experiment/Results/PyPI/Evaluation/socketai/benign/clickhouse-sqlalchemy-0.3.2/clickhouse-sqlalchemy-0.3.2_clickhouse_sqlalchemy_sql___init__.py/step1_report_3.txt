{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define and export classes and functions related to database schema and query selection, likely as part of a larger database abstraction or ORM system.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules .schema and .selectable, which are sources of code and data within the package.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are visible in this snippet; no untrusted data handling or external communication is evident.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are apparent in this minimal code snippet; the code primarily exports references imported from other modules.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present. The code structure and content are straightforward and standard for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and functions from internal modules, then explicitly exports them via __all__ for package API control. There are no dynamic code execution, network operations, or credential handling. Since the code is limited to import/export statements, it doesn't pose any security risk or malicious intent. It appears to be standard package setup code.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple module initializer that imports and exports symbols without any malicious behavior or security issues. No suspicious activity is detected.",
