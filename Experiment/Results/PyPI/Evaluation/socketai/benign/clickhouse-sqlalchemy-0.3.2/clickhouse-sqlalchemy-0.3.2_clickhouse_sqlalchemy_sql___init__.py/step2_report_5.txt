  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**1. Confirm if the reported issues are present in the code:**\n\n- The code is a simple Python module that imports classes/functions from internal modules (.schema and .selectable) and re-exports them via `__all__`.\n- No dynamic code execution, data processing, network communication, or user input handling.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads.\n- The code is standard boilerplate for module exports, typical in Python packages.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports correctly identify that this code is benign and contains no malicious or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**2. Identify and record any errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic, reasoning, or summary:**\n\n- The reports uniformly state that the code is straightforward, with no anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n- They correctly note the absence of data flows, sinks, or sources involving untrusted data.\n- The analysis in each report aligns with the code snippet, which is purely import/export declarations.\n\n**No errors or flaws are evident in the reports' reasoning.**\n\n---\n\n**3. Review the scores given to each issue:**\n\n- All reports assign:\n  - Confidence: 1 (high confidence)\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Malware: 0\n  - SecurityRisk: 0\n\n- These scores are consistent with the analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n**Recommendation:** The scores seem appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**4. Justify any risk score higher than 0.5:**\n\n- Since all reports assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious activity, and security risk is also 0, no justification for higher scores is necessary.\n- The code is a simple module initializer, with no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:** No higher risk scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**5. Pay close attention to the malware score:**\n\n- All reports agree on malware score 0.\n- The code does not perform any suspicious or malicious actions.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads.\n\n**Therefore, the malware score remains 0.**\n\n---\n\n**6. Challenge any claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n\n- The reports correctly avoid assumptions; they state the code is standard and safe.\n- There are no hidden or implied vulnerabilities in this minimal code snippet.\n\n**7. Ensure the scores are consistent with the report:**\n\n- The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- The code is a standard Python module that imports and exports symbols without any malicious or suspicious behavior.  \n- No data flows from untrusted sources, no dynamic code, no obfuscation, and no security risks are evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The scores are appropriate and consistent. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is safe, standard boilerplate for a Python package, with no security concerns.",
