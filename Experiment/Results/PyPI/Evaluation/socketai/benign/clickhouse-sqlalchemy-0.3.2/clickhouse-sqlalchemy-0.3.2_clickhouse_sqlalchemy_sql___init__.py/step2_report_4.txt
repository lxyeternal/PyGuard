  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the code snippet to determine if the assessments are accurate and consistent, and to derive my own risk estimates.\n\n**Code Review Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward Python module that imports specific classes/functions from internal modules (.schema and .selectable) and then defines `__all__` to specify what symbols are exported. There are no dynamic behaviors, no data processing, no user input handling, no network operations, and no obfuscation or malicious code evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Observations:\n- The code is purely declarative, serving as an API surface for other modules.\n- No data flows from untrusted sources.\n- No anomalies, secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code is standard boilerplate for module exports.\n\n### Analysis of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Correctly identifies the code as module export declarations.\n- **Findings:** No issues; straightforward.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Same as Report 1, consistent analysis.\n- **Scores:** All zero, appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same as above; emphasizes the simplicity and standard nature.\n- **Scores:** All zero, appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same consistent conclusion.\n- **Scores:** All zero, appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same as others; no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** All zero, appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Are any issues present?** No. The code is a minimal, standard module interface pattern.\n- **Are the scores reasonable?** Yes, all reports assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n- **Is there any unaccounted malicious activity?** No. The code only imports and exports symbols, with no logic that could be malicious.\n- **Are any claims based on assumptions?** No. All reports correctly identify the code as boilerplate.\n\n### Final Justification:\nGiven the evidence, I agree with the reports' assessments. The code is benign, with no security risks or malware indications.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk detected)\n\n**In conclusion,** this is a standard, safe module export pattern with no security concerns.",
