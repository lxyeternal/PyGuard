  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the reports:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple module export file (`__init__.py`-like pattern), importing classes/functions from internal modules and exposing them via `__all__`.\n- They uniformly state that there are no data flows, no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and no security risks.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, and malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all 0.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the code against the reports:\n\n**Code:**\n```python\nfrom .schema import Table, MaterializedView\nfrom .selectable import Select, select\n\n__all__ = ('Table', 'MaterializedView', 'Select', 'select')\n```\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The code only imports specific classes/functions from internal modules and re-exports them.\n- No dynamic code execution, no data handling, no external inputs, no network or file operations.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malicious code.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports' assessments are accurate: this is boilerplate module setup code with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Critical review of the reports:\n\n- **Logical accuracy:** The reports correctly identify the nature of the code as a simple import/export module.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk justification:** Since there's no code execution, data handling, or external communication, the risk scores are justified as zero.\n- **Malware score:** Also correctly set to 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The reports do not assume any vulnerabilities beyond the scope of the code snippet; they correctly conclude that there's no suspicious activity.\n\n### Any inconsistencies or unreasonable scores?\n- No. The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on all reports and the code:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Additional comments:**\n- The code is a standard module initializer, common in Python packages.\n- No further action needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The code is benign, with no security concerns.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n- Keep the scores as is: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- No changes necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always remain vigilant for more complex snippets or if the context changes, but for this code, everything appears safe and standard.",
