{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define module exports for database-related classes and functions, likely for a database abstraction or ORM system.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules '.schema' and '.selectable' within the package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks related to untrusted data processing or external output; no network or file operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as the code only imports and exports symbols without executing any logic or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected. The code is straightforward module export statements.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports specific classes and functions from internal modules and defines the public API via __all__. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code execution. The code structure is clean, and no obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup for an ORM or database abstraction library, with no malicious intent or security risks evident. It appears safe and purpose-driven for organizing module exports.",
