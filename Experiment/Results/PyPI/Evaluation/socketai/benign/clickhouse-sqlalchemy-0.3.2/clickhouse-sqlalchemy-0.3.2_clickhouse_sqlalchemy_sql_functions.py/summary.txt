  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign extension for SQLAlchemy to support ClickHouse-specific quantile functions. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is detected. The main issue is a logical bug in the constructor's flow control, which should be fixed. The current security risk scores are justified; the malware and obfuscation scores should remain at 0. The low risk score (~0.1) is acceptable considering the string formatting context."
