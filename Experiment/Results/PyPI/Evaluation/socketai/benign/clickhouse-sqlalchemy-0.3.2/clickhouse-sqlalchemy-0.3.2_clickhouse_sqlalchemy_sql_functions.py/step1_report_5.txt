{
  "purpose": "Define custom SQL functions for quantile calculations in SQLAlchemy with ClickHouse dialect support.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include 'expr' and 'condition' parameters passed to the quantile class, which are coerced into SQL expression elements.",
  "sinks": "The code generates SQL function calls via the compile function, which outputs a string representing the SQL command.",
  "flows": "Input expressions are coerced into expression elements, then used to generate SQL function calls during compilation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors detected. The code uses standard SQLAlchemy extension patterns. No suspicious network activity or backdoors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a generic quantile function with optional conditions, infers return types based on input types, and registers compilation rules for ClickHouse SQL dialect. All data flows are typical of SQL expression construction. No anomalies, hidden behaviors, or malicious patterns are present. It adheres to standard SQLAlchemy extension practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard extension for defining quantile functions in SQLAlchemy targeting ClickHouse. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks based on the code provided.",
