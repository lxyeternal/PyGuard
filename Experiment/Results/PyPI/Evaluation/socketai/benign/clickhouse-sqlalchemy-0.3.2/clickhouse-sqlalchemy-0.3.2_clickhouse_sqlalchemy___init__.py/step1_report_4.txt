{
  "purpose": "The code defines module exports for a Python package, importing functions and classes from internal modules related to database schema and session management.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (.ext.declarative, .orm.session, .sql), and the version tuple.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network calls, file writes, or execution points that handle untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only sets up imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The version string is straightforward. No unusual code structures or dynamic execution are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, version setting, and an __all__ declaration, which specifies public API exports. No user input handling, no network or file operations, and no suspicious code patterns are present. The code appears to be standard module setup code, with no evidence of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a module initializer with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It imports functions/classes and defines the public API for the package.",
