{
  "purpose": "This code module appears to define version information and import certain functions and classes from internal packages for use elsewhere in a larger project.",
  "sources": "The code imports functions and classes from relative modules (.ext.declarative, .orm.session, .sql), which are internal to the package.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks such as network operations, file writes, or execution of untrusted input data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is present. The code primarily manages internal imports and version info.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward and standard for a Python package.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions and classes from internal modules, sets a version tuple and a string version, and defines the __all__ variable for module exports. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The code does not interact with external data sources or perform any operations beyond defining metadata and exposing internal functions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package module that defines version info and exports certain functions/classes. There are no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious behavior.",
