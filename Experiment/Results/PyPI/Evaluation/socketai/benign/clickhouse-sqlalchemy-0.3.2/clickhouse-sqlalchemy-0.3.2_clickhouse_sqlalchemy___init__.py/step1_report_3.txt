{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an import and export module, defining the version and exposing specific functions and classes for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (.ext.declarative, .orm.session, .sql).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no data handling, network operations, or untrusted data processing present.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code only imports and exports functions and classes without data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, a version tuple, a version string, and an __all__ list to specify exports. There are no input reads, data processing, or external interactions. The version information is static. No suspicious code or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module setup with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely re-exports imported components and defines a version. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling.",
