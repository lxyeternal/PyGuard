  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate the reports and the code:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - The code imports internal modules related to database schema (`.ext.declarative`), session management (`.orm.session`), and SQL constructs (`.sql`).\n   - It defines a version tuple and string, and sets `__all__` to specify the public API.\n   - There are no dynamic code executions, no input handling, no network operations, or file manipulations.\n   - The code appears to be a typical package module, likely an `__init__.py` or similar, used for exposing internal components.\n\n2. **Analysis of the Reports**:\n   - All reports agree that the code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior.\n   - They correctly identify that there are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks, and no external interactions.\n   - The code is described as a benign setup or initialization module for a larger package.\n\n3. **Potential Security Concerns**:\n   - No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious code.\n   - No hardcoded secrets or credentials.\n   - No evidence of obfuscation or suspicious constructs.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature.\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - **Security Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, justified by the lack of any security-sensitive operations.\n\n5. **Any Discrepancies or Unreasonable Scores?**\n   - The scores are consistent and reasonable given the code content.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n6. **Overall Risk Estimation**:\n   - Based on the analysis, the code is benign.\n   - Malware score should remain 0.\n   - Obfuscated score should remain 0.\n   - Risk score should be 0, reflecting no security concern.\n\n**Final Summary**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code. There are no indications of malicious or suspicious behavior. The code is a standard, benign module setup for a Python package.",
