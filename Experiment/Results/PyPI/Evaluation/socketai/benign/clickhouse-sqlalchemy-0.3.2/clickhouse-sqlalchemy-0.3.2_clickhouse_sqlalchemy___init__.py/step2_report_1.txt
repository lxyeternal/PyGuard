  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward module that imports internal functions and classes, sets version info, and defines an `__all__` list.\n- There are no signs of dynamic code execution, obfuscation, network activity, or data handling.\n- All reports conclude that the code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly identify that the code only performs imports, version setting, and exports. No issues or vulnerabilities are present.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  No. The reasoning is consistent and aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n- **Scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, risk):**  \n  All reports assign malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0, with confidence = 1. This seems appropriate given the code.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  Since the code does not perform any suspicious operations, the malware score should remain at 0.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  The code is clear and straightforward; no obfuscation is present. Score remains at 0.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  The overall security risk is minimal; the code is a benign module setup. Score remains at 0.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable.  \n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; all findings are based on static analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  The current scores are appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n- **Justification for scores > 0.5:**  \n  Not applicable here; all scores are 0, reflecting no risk.\n\n- **Potential improvements:**  \n  None necessary. The reports are accurate and comprehensive.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard module for a Python package, involving no malicious or suspicious behavior. The reports correctly identify this, and the assigned scores are justified.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- Malware score: **0**  \n- Obfuscated score: **0**  \n- Risk score: **0**\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, and the security assessment aligns with the analysis.",
