{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define and expose functions and classes related to database schema and session management, setting version info and public API.",
  "sources": "The code imports functions and classes from internal modules: .ext.declarative, .orm.session, and .sql. These are not user inputs but internal code references.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks such as network communication, file operations, or execution of untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code mainly defines exports and version info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated elements are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing internal modules, setting version info, and defining an __all__ export list. It does not perform any input handling, data processing, or network operations. All imported modules are internal or part of the package, with no evident malicious behavior or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module setup file, primarily for exporting functions and classes related to database handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this fragment.",
