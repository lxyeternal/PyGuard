{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer or setup file that imports internal components, sets version information, and defines the public API for a package.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only imports internal modules and sets static variables.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static and only performs imports and variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports internal modules related to database schema, session management, and SQL constructs, then defines version info and exports. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or data handling. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module setup for a Python package, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The assessments and scores are justified and accurate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
