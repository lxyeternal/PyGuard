{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define and expose modules and functions related to database operations, such as declarative base retrieval, session creation, and SQL constructs.",
  "sources": "The code imports functions and classes from internal modules (.ext.declarative, .orm.session, .sql). It also defines a version tuple and string, and an __all__ list for exports.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; the code only imports and exposes functions and classes. No untrusted data handling or output occurs within this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks. The code primarily defines module exports and versioning.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code patterns are evident. The version string is straightforward; imported modules are internal and standard for database handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical module initialization or package __init__.py file. It imports specific functions/classes from internal modules and sets up versioning information. The use of relative imports suggests it's part of a larger package. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior is present. No input/output flows or external data handling that could be exploited.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It simply prepares and exposes functions and classes for database interactions. No malware or security risks are evident.",
