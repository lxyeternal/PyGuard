  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code details, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code manages schema operations, views, TTL expressions, with no malicious behavior observed.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code appears clear.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — low, consistent with minimal risk.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's reasoning is sound. The code is standard schema management, with no signs of malicious intent. The scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on potential unsafe SQL execution via `connection.execute()` and use of dynamic SQL expressions.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity identified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — low, considering potential SQL injection risks are mitigated by ORM and validation.\n\n**Assessment:** The concern about dynamic SQL is valid but does not indicate malicious activity. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code performs schema management, TTL expressions, and view creation, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — minimal risk.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The code is standard for schema management, and the scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing standard schema management, TTL functions, and no malicious signs.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — very low, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusions are reasonable. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—schema management, TTL, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malware.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — clear code.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — low.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is consistent. The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, matching the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low (0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal security concerns, mainly related to dynamic SQL execution which is typical in schema management.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a standard implementation of schema management functions for a database system, likely ClickHouse, using SQLAlchemy.\n- It constructs and executes SQL commands for dropping/creating tables/views and manages TTL expressions.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or malware.\n- The use of custom SQL operators is consistent with database-specific features and does not indicate malicious intent.\n- The validation via `assert` statements is safe and standard.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, mostly due to dynamic SQL potential, but well within normal bounds.\n\n**In conclusion, the reports' scores are appropriate and consistent with the code.**",
