  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code manages schema operations, views, and TTL expressions for a database, likely ClickHouse. No malicious behavior is detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code is standard for schema management, with no signs of malicious activity. The low risk score aligns with this.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion and scores seem reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with focus on schema management and TTL expressions. Slight concern about dynamic SQL execution.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n- **Assessment:** The code constructs SQL commands dynamically but in a controlled manner, typical for such systems. No malicious intent is evident.\n\n**Verdict:** The risk score appears appropriate. No changes recommended.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code handles schema operations and TTL expressions, with standard SQLAlchemy patterns. No malicious activity is detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; the code is purely schema management with no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** The low risk score is justified. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to above, focusing on schema management, TTL functions, and safe execution. No malicious signs.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's purpose; the minimal risk score is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No change necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is for schema and TTL management, with no malicious intent. The functions are standard for such tasks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent; no signs of malware or malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores and reasoning are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code analysis. The code is standard schema management with no malicious payloads.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate; the code is clear and readable.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variations (0.0 to 0.2) are justified based on the controlled nature of the code. The highest risk is 0.2, reflecting minimal concern due to dynamic SQL execution, but overall, the code is safe.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, readable code.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — Slight potential concern due to dynamic SQL, but overall very low risk.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard schema management utility for a database like ClickHouse, with no malicious intent or malware. The scores reflect this well.",
