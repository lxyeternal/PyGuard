{
  "purpose": "Implement HTTP Negotiate authentication, including Kerberos and NTLM, for requests using the requests library.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from request parameters, response headers, response content, and response peer certificate.",
  "sinks": "Headers being set or modified ('Authorization', 'Cookie'), request body (seek operations), network send calls, response headers.",
  "flows": "Response headers (WWW-Authenticate, set-cookie) -> Authorization headers (via base64 encoding) -> network send (requests connection.send).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behavior detected. The code performs standard SSPI-based negotiation, with optional delegation and channel binding.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Windows SSPI-based Kerberos/NTLM authentication for HTTP requests. It handles challenge-response mechanisms, including parsing server challenges and responding accordingly. It includes optional channel binding with TLS peer certificates and delegates credentials if specified. No obfuscated code, no suspicious network connections, no data exfiltration mechanisms, or hidden backdoors are present. The use of sspi, win32security, and related modules aligns with typical Windows security practices. The code correctly manages the request flow and responses, and there are no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements legitimate Windows authentication protocols for HTTP requests with no evident malicious intent or security risks. It performs expected functions for negotiate-based auth, with proper handling of challenges and credential delegation. No malware or malicious activities are detected.",
