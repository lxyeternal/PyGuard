{
  "purpose": "This code enhances the 'requests' library to expose peer SSL certificate information during HTTP responses, likely for debugging or logging purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the 'requests' library internals, specifically from response objects and the socket connection.",
  "sinks": "Assigns peer certificate data to response objects; no direct data leaks or untrusted data flows identified.",
  "flows": "Intercepts the initialization of HTTPResponse objects to store peer certificate data; does not process external untrusted input beyond this point.",
  "anomalies": "The monkeypatching of internal methods to expose peer certificate data is unusual and potentially unsafe if misused, but no malicious intent is evident from this snippet alone.",
  "analysis": "The code modifies the internal behavior of the 'requests' library's response handling to include peer SSL certificate data. It captures the certificate during response initialization and attaches it to the response object. The modifications are straightforward and do not involve user input, environment variables, or untrusted data sources. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code is apparent. The purpose appears to be for debugging or inspection, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign monkeypatch intended to expose SSL peer certificates for debugging or logging. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks within this code snippet.",
