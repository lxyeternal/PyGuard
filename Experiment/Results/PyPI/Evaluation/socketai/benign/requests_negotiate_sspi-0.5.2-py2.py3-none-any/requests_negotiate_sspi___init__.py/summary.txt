  "conclusion": "The code is a benign debugging enhancement that monkeypatches the requests library to expose SSL peer certificates. It does not contain malware or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score should be around 0.2 to 0.3 due to potential exposure of sensitive data through internal patching."
