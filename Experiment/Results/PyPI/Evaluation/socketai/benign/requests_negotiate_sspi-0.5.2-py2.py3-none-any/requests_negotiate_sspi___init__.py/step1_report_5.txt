{
  "purpose": "Enhance the requests library to expose peer SSL certificate information for HTTPS connections.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the response object (resp.peercert) and modifies the HTTPResponse and HTTPAdapter classes in the requests library.",
  "sinks": "The peer certificate data is stored in the response object, which could potentially be accessed or leaked if misused, but no data is transmitted externally by this code.",
  "flows": "HTTPResponse.__init__ retrieves the peer certificate and stores it in self.peercert; HTTPAdapter.build_response transfers this data to the response object.",
  "anomalies": "The code monkeypatches internal methods of the requests library to expose peer certificates, which is an unusual practice and may indicate attempts to bypass standard security controls. No hardcoded credentials or malicious payloads are present.",
  "analysis": "The code redefines __init__ of HTTPResponse to capture the peer SSL certificate during response creation, and modifies build_response to attach this certificate to the response object. This behavior is intended for debugging or security analysis, not malicious activity. It does not transmit or leak data externally, but the practice of monkeypatching internal library functions can be risky if misused. No malicious behavior or malware signatures are detected. The code’s purpose appears to be to expose SSL peer certificates, which can be sensitive but is not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to expose peer SSL certificate information within the requests library by monkeypatching internal methods. While this is an unusual practice and could be misused, it does not contain malicious intent or malware signatures. It poses some security concerns related to exposing sensitive SSL data but does not actively harm or exploit systems.",
