{
  "purpose": "The code modifies the behavior of the requests library to expose peer SSL certificate information in HTTP responses.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input data; it primarily modifies existing classes within the requests library.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks are present that handle untrusted input for processing or leakage; the code only augments the existing library functionality.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows, as the modifications do not process external data but enhance internal responses.",
  "anomalies": "The code monkeypatches internal methods of the requests library, which can be risky or unusual but is not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports requests and its internal modules, then redefines the __init__ method of HTTPResponse and build_response method of HTTPAdapter to add a 'peercert' attribute. This allows access to the peer SSL certificate information directly from responses, which can be useful for security inspection. There are no external data inputs, no malicious payloads, and no suspicious behavior such as data exfiltration or backdoors. The modifications are aimed at exposing SSL peer certificates, a legitimate debugging or security feature, but they do involve internal patching which can be considered unusual or potentially risky if used maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate attempt to expose SSL peer certificate information by monkeypatching the requests library. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks beyond the potential misuse of internal patching techniques. Overall, it is a benign modification primarily aimed at enhancing SSL inspection capabilities.",
