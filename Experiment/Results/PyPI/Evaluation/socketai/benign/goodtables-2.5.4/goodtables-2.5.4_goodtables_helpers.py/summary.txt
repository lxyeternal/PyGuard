  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign utility for creating a data package from resource files. It does not contain malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious logic. The main security consideration is the lack of resource path validation, which could be exploited if resource_paths are untrusted, but this is a common pattern and not an active threat. The assigned scores are appropriate: malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk around 0.2. Minor improvements could include validating resource paths to enhance security, but overall, the code is safe and trustworthy."
