  "purpose": "Initialize a data package with resources by inferring schema from given paths.",
  "sources": "Function parameter 'resource_paths', 'path' in for loop",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data leads to leaks or malicious actions",
  "flows": "resource_paths → for loop → dp.infer(path)",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated logic. The code uses external library 'datapackage' but does not misuse it.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to create a data package object and infer schemas from provided resource paths. It leverages the 'datapackage' library. There are no hardcoded secrets, no external network calls, and no suspicious logic. The use of 'dp.infer' suggests schema inference from local file paths, which appears legitimate. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling are observed. The code appears to be straightforward and intended for data packaging tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility function for creating data packages from resource paths, with no malicious or suspicious elements detected.",
