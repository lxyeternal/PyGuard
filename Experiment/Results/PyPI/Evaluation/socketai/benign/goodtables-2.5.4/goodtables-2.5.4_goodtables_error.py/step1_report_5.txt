{
  "purpose": "Defines an Error class for data validation, describing validation check errors with properties and methods for error details and comparisons.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__ for compatibility, imports functools, and a local 'spec' module; reads error codes and specifications from 'spec'.",
  "sinks": "Uses error codes and message substitutions that could potentially process untrusted input, but primarily for internal error handling.",
  "flows": "Error instantiation uses input parameters (code, message, substitutions) to generate error objects; message property formats messages using provided substitutions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a validation error class that utilizes external specifications and supports error comparison. It includes message formatting with substitutions but does not execute untrusted code or perform network operations. The code structure and imported modules are standard and do not show signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a validation error class with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It relies on external specifications and safe formatting. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected.",
