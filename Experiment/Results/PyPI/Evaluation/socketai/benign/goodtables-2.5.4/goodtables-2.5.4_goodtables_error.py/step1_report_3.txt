{
  "purpose": "This code defines an Error class used for handling validation check errors, including error code, message, context, and comparison functionalities.",
  "sources": "The code reads error definitions from an imported spec module, and input data may be passed via parameters such as cell, row_number, and message_substitutions.",
  "sinks": "The message property uses string formatting that involves message_substitutions, which could potentially be exploited if untrusted data is used in substitutions. The class does not perform any system calls, network operations, or data leaks directly.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data in message_substitutions can flow into the message property through string formatting. The class itself does not include external sinks like network or file I/O.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code structure is straightforward and standard for data modeling.",
  "analysis": "The class primarily manages error information with standard attributes and comparison methods. It reads error specs from an imported module and formats messages using provided substitutions. The use of string.format on message with external input could be a concern if the input is untrusted, but this is a common pattern. There are no network calls, no file operations, or any system-level commands. No malicious code or backdoors are present. The code appears to be a typical data container with minimal logic, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard error handling class with no malicious behavior. The only minor concern is the string formatting with user-provided substitutions, which should be sanitized if derived from untrusted sources. Overall, it poses no significant security risk.",
