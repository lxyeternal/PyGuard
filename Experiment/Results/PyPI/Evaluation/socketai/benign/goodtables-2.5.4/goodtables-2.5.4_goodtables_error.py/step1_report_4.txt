{
  "purpose": "This code defines an Error class used for representing validation check errors within a data quality framework.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from parameters passed during object instantiation, specifically 'code', 'cell', 'row_number', 'message', and 'message_substitutions'. It also accesses 'spec' imported from a local module.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data flows into system commands, network calls, or file operations. The class mainly formats and returns error messages based on provided data.",
  "flows": "Input data (error details, message substitutions) flows into the object during initialization. These are used in properties like 'message' which formats strings with this data. No data flows into external systems or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present. The code appears to be straightforward class implementation for error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features for compatibility, defines an Error class with properties and methods to describe validation errors, and accesses a 'spec' for error message templates. The class formats messages dynamically with provided substitutions. No network or file operations, no data leaks, no suspicious code patterns. All operations are within the scope of error data representation. The usage of 'spec' for error details appears legitimate, assuming 'spec' is a safe, static configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of an error handling class for data validation purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. It simply manages error data with formatted messages. Overall, the code appears benign.",
