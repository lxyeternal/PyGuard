  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign error handling class with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The only minor concern is the use of string formatting with external data, which should be sanitized if from untrusted sources. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting this minor concern. The reports' assessments are consistent and appropriate."
