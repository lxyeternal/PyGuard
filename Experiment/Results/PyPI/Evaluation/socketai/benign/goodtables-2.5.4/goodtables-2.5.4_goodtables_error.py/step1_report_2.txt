{
  "purpose": "Define a class 'Error' to represent validation check errors with associated metadata, messages, and comparison capabilities.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the 'spec' module for error specifications, constructor parameters (code, cell, row_number, message, message_substitutions), and potentially external error codes.",
  "sinks": "The code generates formatted error messages using 'message' and 'message_substitutions', but no direct sinks such as network, file, or database operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters and 'spec' data flow into class attributes; error messages are constructed via string formatting during 'message' property access; no external data flow or untrusted input execution is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns detected. The code strictly manages error information with standard Python features. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features, defines an Error class with properties and methods for error handling, including message formatting and comparison operations. It relies on an external 'spec' for error codes and messages, and formats messages with substitutions. There are no network calls, file operations, or unsafe practices. It appears to be a standard, well-structured error management class with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward error handling class that does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. It does not contain hidden backdoors, data leaks, or malicious network activities. The overall security risk is negligible.",
