  "purpose": "Load and parse a JSON specification file located in the same directory as the script.",
  "sources": "Reading 'spec.json' file using os.path.join and io.open with utf-8 encoding.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; only local file read operation without data transmission or execution.",
  "flows": "Source: File system read of 'spec.json' -> Load JSON into 'spec' variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward configuration loading with no suspicious code or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features for compatibility, constructs a file path to 'spec.json' relative to the script's directory, opens and reads the JSON file with utf-8 encoding, and loads its contents into a variable. It performs a simple, standard configuration load without user input, network activity, or code execution. No signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security issues are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with high confidence. The code's behavior is safe, and the scores are justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration loader with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
