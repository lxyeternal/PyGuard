  "purpose": "Load a JSON specification file located relative to the current script.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'spec.json' file located in the same directory as the script.",
  "sinks": "The loaded data is stored in the 'spec' variable; no untrusted sinks are directly present.",
  "flows": "The code reads 'spec.json' from the filesystem and loads it into memory without further processing.",
  "anomalies": "Uses __future__ imports, which are standard; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a function to load a JSON file relative to the script's directory, and assigns the loaded data to a global variable. It performs straightforward file reading and JSON parsing without executing or evaluating untrusted data. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious flows.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a simple, benign task of loading a JSON configuration file. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
