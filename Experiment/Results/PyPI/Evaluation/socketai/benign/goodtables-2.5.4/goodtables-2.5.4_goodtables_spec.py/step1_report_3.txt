{
  "purpose": "The code loads a JSON specification file from the same directory as the script, possibly for configuration or data purposes.",
  "sources": "Reading the file 'spec.json' from the local filesystem using os.path and json.load.",
  "sinks": "The file content is loaded into memory; no data is written or sent elsewhere in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "File path construction -> Opening and reading 'spec.json' -> Parsing JSON into a Python object.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __future__ imports is standard for compatibility; no suspicious or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function '_load_spec' that constructs a file path based on its own directory and loads a JSON file named 'spec.json'. It then assigns the loaded data to a variable 'spec'. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no data output or network communication, and no suspicious or malicious code. The code appears to be straightforward configuration loading with standard libraries. No signs of obfuscation, malware, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply loads a JSON specification file from its directory. It exhibits no malicious behavior, no suspicious anomalies, and poses no security threat.",
