  "purpose": "Load a JSON specification file from the same directory as the script.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'spec.json' file from the local filesystem using os.path and io.open.",
  "targets": "No direct outputs or external data sinks are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "File path construction (os.path.join) -> Opening and reading 'spec.json' -> Loading JSON content into 'spec'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; standard usage of filesystem and JSON loading.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features for compatibility, defines a function to load a JSON spec from a local file, constructs the file path relative to the current script's directory, opens and reads the JSON file with utf-8 encoding, then loads it into a variable 'spec'. No user input, external data sources, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be a straightforward configuration loader.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply loads a local JSON file for configuration purposes without any malicious intent or security risks. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors detected.",
