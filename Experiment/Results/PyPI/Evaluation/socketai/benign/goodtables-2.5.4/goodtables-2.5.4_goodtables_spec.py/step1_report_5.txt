  "purpose": "Load a JSON specification file from the same directory as the script.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'spec.json' file from the filesystem using os.path.join and io.open.",
  "sinks": "json.load reading data from the spec.json file; no other sinks present.",
  "flows": "File path constructed with os.path.join, data loaded via json.load from the file opened with io.open.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code uses standard libraries, and the logic appears straightforward. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features for compatibility, then defines a function to load a JSON file named 'spec.json' located in the same directory. It constructs the path with os.path.join and loads the JSON content using io.open with UTF-8 encoding. The module API assigns the loaded spec to a variable. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a simple and legitimate operation of loading configuration data from a JSON file. There are no indications of malicious activity or security risks in this fragment.",
