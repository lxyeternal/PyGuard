  "purpose": "Load a JSON specification file from the same directory as the script.",
  "sources": "Reading the file 'spec.json' located in the same directory as the script.",
  "sinks": "json.load reads data from the file; no untrusted data is processed or sent elsewhere.",
  "flows": "os.path.join constructs the file path -> io.open reads the file -> json.load parses the data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and standard for loading a JSON configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script imports future features for compatibility, then loads a JSON file named 'spec.json' located relative to the script's directory. It opens and parses the JSON file into a Python object. No user input, network activity, or data leaks are involved. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for loading configuration data and shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
