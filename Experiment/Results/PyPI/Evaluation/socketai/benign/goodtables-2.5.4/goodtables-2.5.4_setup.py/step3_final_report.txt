{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for packaging a Python project, responsible for defining dependencies, metadata, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Static files read (README.md, VERSION), dependency lists, and package metadata definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "Reading static files into variables, then passing these variables into the setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no dynamic execution, network activity, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It reads static files and defines dependencies and metadata without any dynamic or suspicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or obfuscated code are present. The functions used are typical and controlled. The code's structure and content indicate a benign, well-formed package configuration. No vulnerabilities, malicious payloads, or obfuscation are detected. The dependency lists are standard, and no suspicious patterns are evident. The code does not process untrusted input or perform any operations that could lead to data leaks or system compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. All signals, including malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores, are appropriately zero. The code poses no security threat, and the scores are consistent with the analysis.",
