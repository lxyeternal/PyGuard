  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It is a typical `setup.py` script for packaging a Python project.\n- Reads version info and README from local files.\n- Defines dependencies and package metadata.\n- Uses standard `setuptools` functions.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated code.\n- No secrets or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Code presence:** The code matches the description and contains no suspicious or malicious elements.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Security risks:** None evident.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- The `tests_require` argument in `setup()` is incorrectly written as `tests_require` instead of `tests_require` (which is the correct argument name). But this is a common typo and does not impact security or malware detection.\n\n### Scores and reasoning:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — No malware or malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — Code is straightforward and well-structured.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — No security risk or vulnerabilities identified.\n\n### Critical assessment:\n- All reports agree that this is a benign, standard setup script.\n- No suspicious code, network activity, or data leaks.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified here; the code is static and controlled.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are appropriate.\n- No changes needed.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** This setup script is benign and poses no security threat. All reports are consistent with this assessment.",
