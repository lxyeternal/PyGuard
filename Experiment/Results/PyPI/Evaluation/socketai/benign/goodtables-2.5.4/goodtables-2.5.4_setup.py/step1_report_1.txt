  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'goodtables' Python package, used to configure package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads package version from a file, reads README content, and loads dependencies from predefined lists.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data flows into potentially dangerous functions or network operations.",
  "flows": "Reads version and description files, then passes data into setup() to configure package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior. Use of standard setup tools and straightforward dependency management.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup operations: reading files for version and README, defining dependencies, and configuring package metadata. No dynamic code execution, no network operations, and no obfuscated code are present. The code adheres to common packaging practices and contains no signs of malicious activity or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a typical setup configuration for a Python package, with no malicious or suspicious elements identified. It appears to be a benign, well-structured package setup script.",
