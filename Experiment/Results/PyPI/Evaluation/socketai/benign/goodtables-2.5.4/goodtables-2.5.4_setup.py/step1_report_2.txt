{
  "purpose": "The code sets up and prepares a Python package named 'goodtables' for distribution, including dependencies, metadata, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading files 'README.md' and the version file, and defining dependency lists.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; setup configuration data is static and controlled.",
  "flows": "Reading package files → constructing setup configuration → executing setup() with static data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; all code uses standard library functions and static data. No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs package setup operations: reading files for long description and version, defining dependencies, and invoking setup() with static parameters. The read() function reads files using controlled paths; no untrusted input sources are present. No obfuscated code, code injection, or malicious behavior detected. The dependencies listed are standard Python packages, with no indication of malicious intent. No network activity or data leaks are observed. The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, with no suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It only performs package configuration with static data and controlled functions.",
