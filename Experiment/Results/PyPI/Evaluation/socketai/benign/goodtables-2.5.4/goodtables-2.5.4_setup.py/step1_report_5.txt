{
  "purpose": "This script configures the setup and installation parameters for the 'goodtables' Python package, including dependencies, metadata, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file, reading the VERSION file within the package directory, and gathering package files with find_packages.",
  "sinks": "None of the code explicitly writes to or executes untrusted data; it primarily reads static files and defines package setup parameters.",
  "flows": "Reads static files for description and version, then passes data to setuptools.setup() to configure package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious network activity or obfuscation. The code adheres to standard setup script conventions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules for setup configuration, reads static files for description and version information, and defines dependencies and metadata for packaging. There are no functions that process user input, nor any code that executes untrusted data. The only dynamic aspect is reading files from the filesystem, which is standard for setup scripts. No anomalous or suspicious code patterns, such as hidden network connections, code obfuscation, or backdoors, are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It performs no malicious actions, contains no malicious code, and poses no security risks. It is safe and appears to be legitimate project configuration code.",
