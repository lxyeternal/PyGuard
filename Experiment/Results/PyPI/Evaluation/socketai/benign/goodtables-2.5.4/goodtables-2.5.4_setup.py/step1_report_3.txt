{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'goodtables' Python package, used for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads 'VERSION' file and 'README.md' for long description; imports standard modules and 'setuptools'.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data is used directly in a way that could cause harm.",
  "flows": "Reads version and README files during setup; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup operations: reading files for version and description, defining dependencies, and calling 'setup()'. All inputs are static or local files, with no user input or network input involved at runtime. There are no suspicious functions or code paths. The dependencies listed are typical for a Python package, with no signs of malicious libraries. The code structure and content are consistent with a normal setup.py file. No anomalies or malicious intent observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging the 'goodtables' library. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and performs typical setup tasks. It poses no security risks.",
