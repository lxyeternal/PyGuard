  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a wrapper for data validation, delegating to an Inspector class. No suspicious activity or malware detected. Confidence 0.9, malware 0, risk 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly notes the absence of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The logic is straightforward, and no external network or data exfiltration is evident.\n\n- **Verdict:** The assessment is accurate. No issues found.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the safe handling of data sources, no external calls, and no malicious patterns. Slightly higher security risk score (0.1), but malware remains 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The only minor concern is the \"securityRisk\" of 0.1, which might be due to the potential for untrusted sources being passed to the Inspector, but without evidence of malicious activity, this is acceptable.\n\n- **Verdict:** The scoring aligns with the reasoning. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the safe handling of sources, no suspicious code, and standard input normalization. Malware score remains 0, securityRisk 0.2, which is acceptable given the input normalization.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The slight increase in securityRisk is justified, considering the potential for untrusted sources, but no actual vulnerabilities or malware are present.\n\n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the straightforward nature of the code, with no suspicious patterns or malicious code. Malware score 0, securityRisk 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code acts as a simple wrapper with input normalization and delegation.\n\n- **Verdict:** Accurate assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights that the code is a safe validation wrapper, with no malicious behavior. Security risk is slightly higher at 0.2, but malware is 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The potential \"sink\" is passing untrusted sources to the Inspector, but without evidence of malicious activity, this is not a security concern.\n\n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** None of the reports identify actual vulnerabilities, malware, or obfuscation. All recognize the code as a straightforward wrapper delegating to an Inspector class.\n\n- **Scores:** The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity. The security risk scores are low (0.1–0.2), reflecting the potential for untrusted input but no actual exploitation.\n\n- **Logic flaws:** No logical flaws or reasoning mistakes are evident. The reports are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malware.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — The code is clear, straightforward, and uses standard practices.\n\n- **Risk score:** **0.1–0.2** — Slightly elevated due to potential untrusted input handling, but no actual security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a benign, standard data validation wrapper with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The existing reports' scores are reasonable and justified.",
