{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for validating data sources (files, URLs, dicts, etc.) using an Inspector class, returning validation reports.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from file paths, URLs, dictionaries, lists of dictionaries, or file-like objects; it also processes optional parameters for validation.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks handling untrusted data or executing commands; the code mostly manages data flow and configurations for validation.",
  "flows": "Input data (sources) are processed, options are parsed, and then passed to Inspector.inspect(). There are no evident flows leading to unsafe operations or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The use of 'from __future__' imports and handling of different input types is standard. The code appears straightforward and does not include obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes validation options, parses arguments, and calls an Inspector object for data validation. The argument parsing accounts for different input types, including Path objects and lists of dicts. No unsafe code, external command execution, or suspicious network activity is present. The functions serve as an API wrapper for validation, with proper handling of options and inputs. There are no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard validation API that processes input data and options for a data inspector. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The implementation is straightforward, with no suspicious or harmful patterns.",
