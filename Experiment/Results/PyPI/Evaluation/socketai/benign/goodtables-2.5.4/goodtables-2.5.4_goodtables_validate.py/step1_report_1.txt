{
  "purpose": "The code provides a validation function for different data sources, primarily to check data integrity and structure, and generate reports.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are accepted as strings (file paths, URLs), dictionaries, lists of dictionaries, or file-like objects; it processes paths and list elements possibly containing sources.",
  "sinks": "The code itself does not process or output untrusted data directly; it passes data to the Inspector class and its methods, which are not detailed here.",
  "flows": "Input source → parsed in _parse_arguments → passed to Inspector.inspect() → generates report",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic is present. Use of future imports is standard for compatibility; no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code acts as a wrapper for data validation, with argument parsing and input normalization. It supports various source types and options, delegating actual inspection to the Inspector class. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present; no external network connections or data exfiltration mechanisms are visible. The functions are straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data validation wrapper with no malicious intent, no suspicious activities, and no security risks identified. It performs input normalization and delegates validation to an external inspector. There are no signs of malware or security threats within this code fragment.",
