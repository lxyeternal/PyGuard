  "purpose": "Generate structured cell data from headers, schema fields, and optional values for tabular data processing.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: headers, schema_fields, values, row_number",
  "sinks": "create_cell function, which outputs a dictionary representing a cell",
  "flows": "Headers and schema_fields are combined with values in zip_longest; create_cell constructs cell dictionaries from these values",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. Usage of '_fillvalue' as a fill value is standard for handling missing data; no suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: create_cells and create_cell, to build a list of cell dictionaries based on provided headers, schema fields, and optional values. It uses zip_longest to pair inputs, handling missing data with '_fillvalue'. The create_cell function generates a dictionary with cell attributes, removing None values via _remove_none_values. No external data sources, network operations, or security-sensitive functions are present. The code appears to be a standard utility for tabular data processing without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation for creating cell data structures, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It handles missing data carefully and employs typical patterns. There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or suspicious data handling.",
