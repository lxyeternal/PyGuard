{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to generate a list of cell dictionaries based on headers, schema fields, and optional values, typically for data processing or table creation.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: headers, schema_fields, values, row_number",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data is being sent to external systems, networks, or file writes",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> create_cells -> create_cell -> _remove_none_values",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'zip_longest' with a fillvalue, but no suspicious dynamic code, obfuscation, or malicious logic detected. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors. The comment about deprecated 'number' attribute is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python constructs for iterating and creating data structures. No input sanitization or external data handling appears, thus no injection or leak vectors. No suspicious external calls, network access, or data exfiltration. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. The functions are focused on data structuring, with clear and safe logic. The comment about removing a deprecated attribute indicates maintenance, not malicious intent. Overall, the code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical data processing utility for table-like structures, with no indications of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears safe and benign.",
