{
  "purpose": "Create structured cell data from headers, schema fields, and optional values for use in tabular data processing.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: headers, schema_fields, values, row_number.",
  "sinks": "The function 'create_cell' outputs cell dictionaries, but no untrusted data is directly used in sensitive operations; no external sinks or network actions.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through 'create_cells' into 'create_cell', which formats data into dictionaries, then removes None values.",
  "anomalies": "Use of '_fillvalue' as a sentinel; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; no obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code generates cells from headers, schema, and optional values, handling default and empty cases with fill values. It employs 'zip_longest' for iteration and constructs dictionaries for each cell. The '_remove_none_values' function cleans the output. No external or network operations, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious logic or data handling are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard data structuring utility for tabular data, with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or malware. It mainly manipulates in-memory data structures and uses safe practices.",
