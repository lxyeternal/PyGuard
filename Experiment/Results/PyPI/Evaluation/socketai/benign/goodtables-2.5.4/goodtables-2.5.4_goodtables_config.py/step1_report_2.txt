  "purpose": "The code initializes configuration settings for a data validation tool called 'goodtables', setting version info, limits, presets, and checks.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from a file located relative to the script's directory.",
  "sinks": "No data flows to external systems or untrusted sources; no sink points identified.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from a local file; no further data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated patterns, or hardcoded secrets present. The code appears standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily imports future features for compatibility, reads version info from a local file, and defines configuration lists for checks and presets related to data validation. There are no indications of malicious code, backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious behaviors. All code appears to serve legitimate configuration purposes for the 'goodtables' package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration setup with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply reads a version file and defines configuration constants and lists.",
