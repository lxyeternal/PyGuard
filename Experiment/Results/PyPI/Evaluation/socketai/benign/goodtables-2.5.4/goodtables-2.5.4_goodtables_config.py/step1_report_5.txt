{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define configuration constants and import statements for a data validation library, likely related to the 'goodtables' package, setting up presets, checks, and version info.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'VERSION' file from the same directory as the script",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data could cause harm or leaks",
  "flows": "The version string is read and stored; no data flows from untrusted sources or external inputs into critical sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors observed; the code is straightforward configuration and import statements",
  "analysis": "The code performs import statements, reads a version file, and defines lists of presets and checks for data validation. All operations are static, without dynamic code execution, network operations, or handling of untrusted input. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration setup for a data validation framework and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be safe and legitimate.",
