{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define configuration parameters, presets, and checks for a data validation tool called 'goodtables'. It loads version information from a file and lists various checks to be performed on tabular data.",
  "sources": "The code reads version information from a file named 'VERSION' located in the same directory as the script.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data directly flows into sensitive operations or external systems. No database or network interactions are present.",
  "flows": "The flow involves reading a version string from a file, but there are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward, with standard import statements and configuration variables.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features for compatibility, loads version info from a local file, and defines lists for presets and checks used by a data validation tool. All operations are benign and typical for configuration files. There are no signs of code obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration module for a data validation library. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The likelihood of malware or malicious intent is very low.",
