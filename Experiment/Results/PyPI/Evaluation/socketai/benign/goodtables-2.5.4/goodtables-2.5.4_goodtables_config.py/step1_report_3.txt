{
  "purpose": "This code appears to set up configuration and presets for data validation checks in a data quality framework.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'VERSION' file from the current directory to obtain version information.",
  "sinks": "No evident sink for untrusted data; no external network or sensitive data handling present.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from local file; no data flows from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code; standard import practices.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features for compatibility, reads a version string from a local file, and defines various configuration constants including limits, presets, and checks. It contains no network operations, external data handling beyond the version file, or code execution functions. The use of 'io.open' to read a local file is standard and does not pose security risks. The overall structure is typical for a configuration module for a data validation library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration script for a data validation package. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. The implementation is standard, with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
