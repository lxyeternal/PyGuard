{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a configuration module for the 'goodtables' data validation library, defining version info, preset configurations, and validation checks.",
  "sources": "Reads version string from a local 'VERSION' file.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed; no external sinks involved.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward configuration script that imports future features for compatibility, reads a version string from a local file, and defines lists for presets and checks. It contains no dynamic code execution, network operations, or handling of untrusted input. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions indicate a benign purpose. All observed behaviors are standard for configuration modules, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration module with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
