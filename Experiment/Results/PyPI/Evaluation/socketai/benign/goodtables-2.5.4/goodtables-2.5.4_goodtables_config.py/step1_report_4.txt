{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up configuration variables, version reading, and define preset checks for data validation tools, likely part of a data quality or validation library.",
  "sources": "The code reads the VERSION file from the same directory as the script using io.open.",
  "sinks": "No sinks (e.g., data output, network, or system modification functions) are present; the code only reads a file and defines constants.",
  "flows": "The flow involves reading the version string from a local file; no untrusted data or external input is processed in a way that could lead to security issues.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior; no hardcoded secrets other than a version string read from a local file. No obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious functions are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports future features for compatibility, reads a version file, and defines preset check lists for data validation purposes. There are no external inputs, network operations, or data manipulations that could be exploited. The code structure is straightforward, primarily configuration data, and does not contain any malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration/setup module for data validation checks, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It only reads a version string from a local file and defines constants.",
