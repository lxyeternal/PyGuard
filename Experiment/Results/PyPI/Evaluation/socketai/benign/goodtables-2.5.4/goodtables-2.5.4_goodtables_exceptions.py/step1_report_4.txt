  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling errors related to 'goodtables' within a larger project.",
  "sources": "No data sources or input reading; only import statements and class definition.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output actions present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely defines a class with no execution or data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of future imports is standard for compatibility; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features for compatibility and defines a simple custom exception class. It does not include any input/output operations, network access, or code execution. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The code appears to be part of a larger codebase intended to handle specific exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign class definition for a custom exception, with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It is standard and straightforward, serving a purpose within a larger application.",
