  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-reference with the provided code.\n\n**Code Review Summary:**\n- The code is a straightforward Python script defining a single custom exception class `GoodtablesException` inheriting from `Exception`.\n- It includes future imports for compatibility across Python 2 and 3.\n- There are no data inputs, outputs, external communications, or logic beyond class definition.\n- The code appears benign, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No, the code is a simple class definition with no issues.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Security risks:** None evident.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None, as the code is purely structural.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1-5:**\n- All reports describe the code as a \"simple custom exception class\" with no external interactions, data handling, or suspicious patterns.\n- The analysis in each report is consistent: standard use of future imports, straightforward class definition, benign intent.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, which aligns with the clear benign nature.\n- Obfuscated and malware scores are 0, matching expectations.\n\n### Scores and reasoning:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all reports is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** 0 in all reports is appropriate, given the benign nature.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- No issues are present; the code is a minimal, standard exception class.\n- The reports do not overstate or understate the security posture; they are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Additional comments:**\n- Given the simplicity and clarity of the code, I agree with the reports' assessments.\n- No modifications needed to the scores or conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is a benign, standard exception class.\n- The scores and reasoning in all reports are appropriate and consistent.\n- No further action or concern is warranted.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the actual code content.",
