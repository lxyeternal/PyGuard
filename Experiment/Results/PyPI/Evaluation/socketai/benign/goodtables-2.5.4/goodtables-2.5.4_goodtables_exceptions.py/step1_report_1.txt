  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for the 'goodtables' project.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading; no data input in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sink operations or data output points; no potential data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow between sources and sinks, as code only defines an exception class.",
  "anomalies": "Use of future imports is standard for compatibility; no anomalies observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward definition of a custom exception class inheriting from Exception, with no additional logic, data handling, or external interactions. It uses Python future imports for compatibility, which are common practices. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks. The class serves as a base exception for the project, and the code appears to be benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard exception class definition with no malicious intent or security issues. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or suspicious operations.",
