  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for the 'goodtables' project.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; the code solely defines an exception class.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code only declares a class.",
  "anomalies": "Use of future imports appears standard; no suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports features from __future__ to ensure compatibility across Python versions. It then defines a simple custom exception class inheriting from Exception. There are no inputs, outputs, data processing, or external communications. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard pattern for defining a custom exception class. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
