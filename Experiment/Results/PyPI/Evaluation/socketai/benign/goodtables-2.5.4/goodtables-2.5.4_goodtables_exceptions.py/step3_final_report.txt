  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for the 'goodtables' project.",
  "sources": "The class definition itself; no external data or input sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the class is a simple exception declaration without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with standard imports and class definition.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features for compatibility and defines a single custom exception class inheriting from Exception. It contains no data inputs, outputs, network calls, or complex logic. The code is minimal, clear, and standard, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns justify these assessments. No issues or security concerns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard custom exception class with no malicious activity or security risks. The reports' assessments are accurate and appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
