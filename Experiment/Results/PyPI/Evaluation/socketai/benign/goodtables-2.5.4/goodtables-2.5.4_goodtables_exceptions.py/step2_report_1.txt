  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Verification**:\n   - The code in all reports is a straightforward class definition:\n     ```python\n     class GoodtablesException(Exception):\n         \"\"\"Base goodtables exception\"\"\"\n         pass\n     ```\n   - It contains only import statements for future compatibility and a simple custom exception class.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, network calls, or any logic beyond class declaration.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or complex behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious or security issues.\n   - No logical errors or misconceptions are evident.\n   - The reasoning is sound: the code is a minimal, standard exception class.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1 (or 1.0)\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed; they are reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:\n   - Since all assessments are zero for malware and security risk, and the code is simple, there's no justification for higher scores.\n   - The code does not perform any suspicious activity or contain vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**:\n   - The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior.\n   - The malware score of 0 is justified and should remain.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's simplicity.\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities are made beyond the scope of the code snippet.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - The confidence levels are high, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Overall Evaluation & Personal Estimate**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThe code is a benign, standard exception class with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and comprehensive.\n\n**Final Summary**:\n- The code is a minimal, standard custom exception class for the 'goodtables' project.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate; no changes necessary.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nI agree with the reports' assessments. The code is safe, benign, and typical for a Python project.",
