  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Review:**\n\nThe provided code is a straightforward Python snippet that:\n\n- Imports future features for compatibility across Python 2 and 3.\n- Defines a single custom exception class `GoodtablesException` inheriting from `Exception`.\n\n**Presence of Issues:**\n\n- **Code correctness:** The class is syntactically correct and performs as intended.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Security risks:** No data input/output, network activity, or other operations that could pose security issues.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is clear and minimal; no obfuscation present.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** The code does not handle untrusted data, nor does it perform any processing that could introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n**Analysis of the Reports:**\n\nAll reports uniformly state that the code is benign, straightforward, and serves as a custom exception class with no malicious or security concerns. They correctly identify the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n**Scores:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is clear.\n- **Risk score:** 0 or 0.5, depending on the interpretation. Given the code's simplicity and lack of any security issues, a score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n**Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n\n- The reports assign a confidence of 1, which is reasonable given the code's simplicity.\n- No report suggests any suspicious behavior or reasons to assign a higher risk score.\n\n**Final Justification:**\n\n- The code is a standard, benign class definition.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n- The code's purpose is to define an exception class, a common pattern.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (confirmed benign)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risk detected)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a simple, standard pattern for defining a custom exception class with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as-is.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the code's nature.",
