  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - The code defines a single class `GoodtablesException` inheriting from `Exception`.\n   - It includes future imports for compatibility.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, external calls, or complex logic.\n   - The code is straightforward and standard for defining a custom exception.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is benign, with no data flow, no malicious activity, and no obfuscation.\n   - No errors, flaws, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n   - The code appears to be a simple, clean exception class definition.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - malware: 0\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n     - confidence: 1 (or 1.0)\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Scores:**\n   - Since the code is purely a class definition with no external interactions or malicious behavior, the scores of 0 for malware and security risk are justified.\n   - The confidence score of 1 indicates certainty about the benign nature, which is reasonable.\n\n5. **Potential Assumptions and Claims:**\n   - The reports do not make any unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No suspicious claims or vulnerabilities are suggested or implied.\n\n6. **Overall Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - The reasoning aligns with the code content.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, benign exception class with no security issues.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate.\n- No further changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code content.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward, benign exception class definition with no malicious intent or security concerns. The scores and analysis are appropriate and consistent.",
