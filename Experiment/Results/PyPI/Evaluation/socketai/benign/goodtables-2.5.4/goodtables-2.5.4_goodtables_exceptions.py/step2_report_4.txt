  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a straightforward class definition: a custom exception inheriting from `Exception`.\n   - All reports correctly identify that there are no data inputs, outputs, external communications, or suspicious behaviors.\n   - The use of `__future__` imports is standard for compatibility and does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment; they correctly identify that the code is benign.\n   - No logical flaws or inaccuracies are apparent in the reasoning.\n   - The conclusions are appropriate, emphasizing the benign nature of the code.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are reasonable given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No adjustments seem necessary unless considering the cumulative context.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely defining a class with no malicious or suspicious behavior, a `securityRisk` of 0 is appropriate.\n   - The `malware` score is also correctly set to 0, indicating no malicious activity.\n   - The overall risk is minimal; thus, scores above 0.5 are unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score of 0 across all reports is justified.\n   - There is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or harmful behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are based on the actual code content; no unwarranted assumptions are made.\n   - The code is minimal and standard, supporting the benign assessment.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - Given the simplicity and benign nature, the scores are appropriate.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a minimal, standard exception class with no malicious or security concerns.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The scores are justified and appropriate.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final conclusion:**\nThe code is benign, and the scores reflect that accurately. No changes are necessary.",
