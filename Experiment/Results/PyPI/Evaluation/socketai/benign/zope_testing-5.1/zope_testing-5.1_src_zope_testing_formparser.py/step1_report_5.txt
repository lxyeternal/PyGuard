  "purpose": "HTML parser for extracting form information from web pages, supporting functional tests.",
  "sources": "HTML data fed into the parse() function; data from HTML tags and attributes during parsing.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; the code primarily processes HTML data into form objects without executing or transmitting data.",
  "flows": "HTML content -> parsing handlers -> form and element objects. No data flows into system commands or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or backdoors. No suspicious dynamic code execution. The code uses standard libraries and patterns for HTML parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of an HTML form parser utilizing Python's standard html.parser. It converts HTML form elements into structured Python objects, with handling for forms, inputs, select options, and associated attributes. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. It does not perform network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration. The only notable operation is URL joining for form actions and source attributes, which are standard practices. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected. The parser is designed for testing purposes, not for executing or transmitting data, reducing risk.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign HTML form parser with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely as a data extraction utility without executing or transmitting untrusted data. Security risk and malware likelihood are minimal.",
