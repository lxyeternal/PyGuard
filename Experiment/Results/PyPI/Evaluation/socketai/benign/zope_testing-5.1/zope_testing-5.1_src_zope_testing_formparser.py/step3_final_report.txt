  "purpose": "A Python HTML parser designed to extract form information from HTML content for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "HTML content data fed into the parser; form, input, select, option tags, and their attributes.",
  "sinks": "URL join operations for form actions and src attributes; internal data storage within form and input objects.",
  "flows": "Data is parsed from HTML tags, stored in internal buffers, and mapped to form objects; URL attributes are resolved via urljoin.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code uses standard libraries and straightforward logic without obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured HTML form parser using Python's built-in html.parser. It handles form, input, select, option, and textarea tags, storing their attributes and values. URL attributes are safely joined with the base URL. No suspicious code, dynamic execution, network activity, or hardcoded secrets are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is minimal (~0.1-0.2), reflecting standard parsing operations without vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard HTML form parser with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with its functionality. It poses no supply chain security risk.",
