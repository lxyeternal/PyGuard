  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the key aspects: presence of malicious code, obfuscation, and overall security risk.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard HTML form parser, using Python's built-in html.parser library.\n- No suspicious or malicious behaviors are detected: no code injection, network activity, or backdoors.\n- The code performs URL joins for form actions and sources, which is standard practice.\n- The code appears to be straightforward, with no obfuscation or dynamic code execution.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 to 1.0), and malware scores are zero across all reports.\n- Security risk scores are low (mostly 0.1 to 0.2).\n\n---\n\n### Confirming Issues in the Code:\n- The code is a standard, well-structured form parser.\n- No issues or vulnerabilities are evident.\n- No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The URL join operations are safe and typical.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- The only minor point is that the code does not sanitize or validate the attributes of HTML tags, but given its purpose as a testing utility, this is acceptable.\n- No security flaws or injection points are evident.\n\n### Scores Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is reasonable given the code clarity.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2). Given the benign nature, these seem appropriate.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n- The code is purely for parsing HTML forms, with no external network activity or data leaks.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n- The low security risk scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned in all reports seem reasonable and consistent.\n- No adjustments are necessary based on the provided analysis.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (to reflect minimal inherent risk due to URL joins and parsing, but overall very safe)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, straightforward HTML form parser with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The reports' assessments are accurate and well-justified.",
