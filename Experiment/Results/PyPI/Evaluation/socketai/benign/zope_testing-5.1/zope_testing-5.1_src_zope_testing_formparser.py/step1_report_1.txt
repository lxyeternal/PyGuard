  "purpose": "HTML parser designed to extract form information from HTML content for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "HTML data fed into parse() function; data attributes in HTML tags during parsing.",
  "sinks": "URL join operations (urlparse.urljoin), which combine base URLs with form actions or src attributes.",
  "flows": "HTML content -> parsing handlers -> URL join operations for form actions and sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. Use of URL join is standard for form action and src attribute resolution.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard HTML form parser utilizing Python's built-in html.parser module. It processes HTML tags like form, input, textarea, select, and option, capturing their attributes and constructing form objects. No code injections, data leaks, or malicious network operations are present. URL joins are used for resolving relative URLs, which is standard. No obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors identified. The functions handle data and attributes securely and in accordance with typical parsing logic. The overall structure indicates a benign, well-structured parser for form extraction with no signs of malicious intent or security flaws.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate HTML form parser intended for testing purposes. It performs standard parsing, URL resolution, and form data collection without any malicious or malicious-looking code segments. No supply chain attack vectors or malware indicators are present.",
