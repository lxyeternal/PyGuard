{
  "purpose": "HTML parser to extract form information from HTML content, supporting functional tests.",
  "sources": "Reads HTML data from the 'data' parameter in parse() and from HTML parser events such as handle_data, handle_starttag, handle_endtag.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes data to external sinks or performs network or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input HTML data through the parser's event handlers to construct form objects and their fields.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of standard libraries for HTML parsing and URL joining, with no dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically parses HTML content to extract form elements, including input, select, option, and textarea tags. It maintains internal state to build form objects and handles URL resolution for form actions and src attributes. No external data transmission, code injection, or malicious logic is present. The code employs safe parsing practices, and all operations are contained within the form extraction context. There are no indicators of sabotage, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions solely as an HTML form extractor with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It employs standard parsing methods and maintains no external communications or system modifications. Overall, it appears to be safe and free from malware or security risks.",
