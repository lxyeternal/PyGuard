  "purpose": "Define and warn about deprecation of a specific exception class in the zope.testing package.",
  "sources": "The import of the warnings module and the deprecation warning issued at runtime.",
  "sinks": "The runtime warning output; no data sinks or external data processing present.",
  "flows": "Import warnings trigger the warning message at runtime; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior; standard deprecation warning and class definition.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the warnings module and issues a deprecation warning advising users to use a different module. It then defines a custom exception class. There are no external data inputs, no suspicious code, or hidden behaviors. The warning is a standard practice to guide users away from deprecated code. The class definition is straightforward and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard deprecation notice with no malicious intent or security issues. It simply warns users about deprecated usage and defines an exception class. No malicious behavior, supply chain threats, or security risks detected.",
