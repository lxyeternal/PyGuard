  "purpose": "Define custom exception for zope.testing and issue a deprecation warning about an old module",
  "sources": "Import warnings module, execute warnings.warn()",
  "sinks": "warnings.warn() could potentially alert users or trigger warning handling routines",
  "flows": "warnings.warn() is called immediately upon import, alerting users about deprecation",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code uses standard Python warnings and exception definitions",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a deprecation warning for a module, advising users to switch to a new module path. It defines a single custom exception class inheriting from AssertionError. The warning is issued at import time, which is standard practice for deprecations. No user input, external data, or untrusted data sources are involved. The code does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious network or system actions.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward, standard Python module for defining an exception and issuing a deprecation warning. It contains no malicious or suspicious activity.",
