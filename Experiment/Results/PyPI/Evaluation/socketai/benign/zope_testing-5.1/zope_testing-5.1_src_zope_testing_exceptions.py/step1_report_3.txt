  "purpose": "Define a custom exception for doctest failures and issue a deprecation warning for a module.",
  "sources": "The warnings.warn() call indicating deprecation of 'zope.testing.exceptions'.",
  "sinks": "Potential deprecation warning output, which is benign and does not pose security risks.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing warnings to issuing a deprecation warning, and defining a custom exception class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and typical for a Python module. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the warnings module, issues a deprecation warning about 'zope.testing.exceptions', and defines a custom exception class for doctest failures. There are no input sources, untrusted data, or data flows that could lead to security issues. The warning is a standard practice to inform users about deprecated modules. The exception class is a simple subclass of AssertionError with no additional logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module that issues a deprecation warning and defines a custom exception for testing purposes. No malicious behavior, no security risks detected.",
