{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception for zope.testing and issues a deprecation warning about an outdated module.",
  "sources": "The warnings.warn() call indicates the code reads its own source for executing the warning.",
  "sinks": "The warnings.warn() function outputs a warning message to the standard error stream.",
  "flows": "Code execution flows from import statements to the warning call, which then outputs a deprecation warning.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies. The warning is straightforward and standard; the custom exception class is simple and typical.",
  "analysis": "The script imports warnings, issues a deprecation warning about a module, and defines a custom exception class. There are no external data inputs, no unsafe code, no hardcoded secrets, nor suspicious behaviors. The warning is informational and does not cause code execution beyond emitting a message. The custom exception class is standard and not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily serving as a deprecation notice and defining a simple custom exception. No malicious activity or security risks are present.",
