  "purpose": "Deprecation warning issued upon module import and definition of a simple custom exception class for doctest failures.",
  "sources": "The warnings.warn() call that issues a deprecation warning; the class definition of DocTestFailureException.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks, network activity, or code execution points present.",
  "flows": "Import triggers the warning; class definition is static and does not involve data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward code with standard practices, no obfuscation, no hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports warnings, issues a deprecation warning about a module, and defines a custom exception class. It does not process external input, perform network operations, or execute malicious actions. The warning is a standard deprecation notice, and the exception class is simple. No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module for issuing a deprecation warning and defining an exception class. There is no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risk. The initial reports are accurate and appropriate.",
