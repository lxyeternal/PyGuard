  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the same or very similar code: importing `warnings`, issuing a deprecation warning about a module, and defining a simple custom exception class.\n- The code is straightforward, with no external data inputs, no network activity, no obfuscation, and no suspicious behavior.\n- The deprecation warnings are standard practice in software maintenance.\n- No evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security vulnerabilities is present.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Analysis:\n\n**1. Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n- The code is correct and functions as intended: it issues a deprecation warning and defines an exception class.\n- No issues, bugs, or errors are evident.\n\n**2. Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- They correctly identify that the code is benign, standard, and contains no malicious behavior.\n- No logical flaws or misinterpretations are apparent.\n\n**3. Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0\n- These scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**4. Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n- None of the reports assign a risk score higher than 0.5.\n- Given the benign nature, a higher risk score would be unjustified.\n\n**5. Malware Score:**\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- No malware present.\n- Scores are correctly set to 0.\n\n**6. Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n- All claims are based on straightforward code analysis.\n- No assumptions about hidden behaviors or vulnerabilities are made.\n- The assessments are justified.\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores:**\n- All reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n- No discrepancies.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is a simple, standard deprecation warning and exception class definition.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior detected.\n- The code is typical for library maintenance and does not pose security threats.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- Maintain the current scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- No additional security review needed for this code snippet.",
