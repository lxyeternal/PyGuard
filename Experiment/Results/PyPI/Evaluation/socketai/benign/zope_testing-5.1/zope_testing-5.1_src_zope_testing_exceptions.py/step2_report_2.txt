  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same or very similar code: a module that issues a deprecation warning upon import and defines a simple custom exception class.\n- No external data inputs, no untrusted data, no network activity, no obfuscated code, and no malicious logic are present.\n- The code is straightforward and follows standard Python practices for deprecation warnings and exception class definitions.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Deprecation warning and exception class.\n- **Analysis:** Accurate; no malicious behavior.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, security risk = 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly rated.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the warning being straightforward.\n- **Analysis:** Same as above; no issues.\n- **Scores:** Appropriate as all zeroes.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on the deprecation warning and exception class.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Correct as zero.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Highlights the immediate warning upon import.\n- **Analysis:** Standard practice; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar analysis; no anomalies.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Scores:** Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** None. All reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning:** None detected.\n- **Scores:**\n  - **Malware:** All reports correctly assign 0.\n  - **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, correct.\n  - **Risk score:** All assign 0 or very low, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Justification for higher scores:** None needed; the code is non-malicious, straightforward, and standard.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n---\n\n### Final conclusion:\nThe code is a simple, standard deprecation warning and exception class definition with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports are accurate and consistent. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is safe, benign, and standard.  \n- Scores are appropriate as given.  \n- No further action needed.",
