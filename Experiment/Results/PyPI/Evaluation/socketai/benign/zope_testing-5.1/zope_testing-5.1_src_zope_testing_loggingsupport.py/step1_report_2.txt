{
  "purpose": "The code implements a custom logging handler for collecting and managing log records for specified logger names, with automatic installation upon creation.",
  "sources": "The code reads logger names passed during initialization, and retrieves logger objects using logging.getLogger(name). It also accesses log record attributes such as name, levelname, and message.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted input data in a way that could lead to security vulnerabilities. It only appends log records to an internal list and formats them for display.",
  "flows": "Logger names are supplied at initialization; install() sets logger levels and adds the handler; emit() stores log records; uninstall() restores previous levels and removes the handler; __str__() formats stored logs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard logging library features, with no hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious external communications.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom logging handler that captures log records for specified logger names. It sets logger levels, attaches itself as a handler, and stores log records in a list. The install() and uninstall() methods manage the attachment lifecycle. The __str__() method formats collected logs for display. All operations involve safe, standard logging practices without user input processing or external data handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of a logging handler designed for collecting and managing log records. It uses standard Python logging practices with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
