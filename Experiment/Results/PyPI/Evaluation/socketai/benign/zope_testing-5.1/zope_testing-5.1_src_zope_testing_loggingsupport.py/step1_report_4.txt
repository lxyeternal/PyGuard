{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom logging handlers for collecting and managing log records for specified logger names.",
  "sources": "Logger instances accessed via logging.getLogger(name), reading their current level and adding/removing handlers.",
  "sinks": "Logging records stored in self.records, output via __str__ method; no external data sinks or network operations.",
  "flows": "Logging records are appended to self.records in emit(), and the records can be outputted or cleared; no external data flow or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code, no data leaks, and no suspicious external calls.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a custom logging Handler class that collects log records from specified logger names. It provides methods to install/uninstall itself as a handler, manage logger levels, and output collected records. The InstalledHandler class automatically installs itself upon creation. There are no external data flows, network operations, or sensitive data handling. The code is straightforward and does not contain suspicious patterns, malicious code, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign custom logging utility designed for capturing and managing log records. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. The overall security risk is very low.",
