  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Implements a `Wait` class for polling a condition function until true or timeout.\n- Uses standard Python `time` functions (`time.time`, `time.sleep`) by default, but allows customization.\n- Raises a custom exception (`TimeOutWaitingFor`) if timeout occurs.\n- The default instance `wait` is provided.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious logic are present.\n- The code is straightforward, flexible, and relies on standard libraries.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in the code?**  \n  No. The code functions as intended for polling with no evident bugs or security flaws.\n\n- **Malicious behavior?**  \n  No. The code does not perform network, file, or system manipulations. The customizable functions (`getnow`, `getsleep`) are standard testing hooks, not malicious.\n\n- **Obfuscation?**  \n  No. The code is clear and straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Score:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.2, obfuscated = 0  \n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is benign, and the small security risk score might reflect the flexibility of replacing functions, but this is expected and not malicious.\n\n#### Report 2:\n- **Score:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, obfuscated = 0  \n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risk.\n\n#### Report 3:\n- **Score:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, obfuscated = 0  \n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is a simple polling utility, no malicious behavior.\n\n#### Report 4:\n- **Score:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, obfuscated = 0  \n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues detected.\n\n#### Report 5:\n- **Score:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, obfuscated = 0  \n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code remains benign.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- All reports assign a very low or zero security risk, which aligns with the analysis.\n- Malware score is zero across all, consistent with the benign nature.\n- Obfuscation is zero, as the code is clear.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, due to the customizable functions, but this is standard and not a concern)\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard, well-structured polling utility with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (to reflect the flexibility of function replacement, but this is typical and not problematic)\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms that the code is safe and the reports are accurate in their assessments.",
