{
  "purpose": "Provides a class for polling a condition until it becomes true or a timeout occurs, raising an exception if timed out.",
  "sources": "Input functions: getnow, getsleep, and the func argument passed to __call__",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted functions passed to __call__, which could be malicious if they perform harmful actions when called.",
  "flows": "The 'func' is invoked repeatedly within the while loop; getnow and getsleep control timing; exception raised upon timeout.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns; the getnow and getsleep functions are customizable, allowing for flexibility but also potential manipulation if replaced.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a polling mechanism with configurable timeout, wait, and exception. It uses lambda defaults for getnow and getsleep, which call time functions. The core logic involves repeatedly calling 'func' until it returns true or timeout. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The design allows user-defined functions for time and sleep, which could be replaced maliciously if used improperly, but this is expected and not inherently malicious. Overall, the code is a standard polling utility with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign polling utility with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise. It offers flexibility via customizable time functions, which is a common pattern. No malware or security risks are evident.",
