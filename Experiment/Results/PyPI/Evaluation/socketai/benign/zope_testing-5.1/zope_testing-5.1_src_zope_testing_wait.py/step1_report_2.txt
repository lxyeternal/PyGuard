{
  "purpose": "The code provides a class `Wait` for polling a condition until it becomes true or a timeout occurs, used for synchronization or waiting in asynchronous operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads system time via `time.time()` and performs sleep via `time.sleep()`. No external inputs are read.",
  "sinks": "The only sink is the call to `sleep(wait)` and the potential raising of an exception `TimeOutWaitingFor`, which is used for control flow.",
  "flows": "The flow involves repeatedly calling a condition function `func()` until it returns true or the timeout is reached. The flow uses the system clock and sleep functions for timing control.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or obfuscated code are present. The exception class is a standard subclass of Exception. The code does not perform network operations, file manipulation, or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward polling utility with configurable timeout, wait interval, and exception. It uses standard library functions for timing and sleeping. The class allows customization through lambda parameters `getnow` and `getsleep`, which can be overridden for testing but do not introduce malicious behavior. There are no hidden or malicious code patterns, backdoors, or privacy violations. The code is well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The use of the exception class is conventional for signaling timeout conditions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign polling utility for waiting until a condition becomes true, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It relies solely on standard library functions and offers customization for testing. Overall, it poses no security threat.",
