  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured polling utility with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's characteristics. The overall security risk is very low, primarily related to potential misuse if functions are replaced maliciously, which is an expected feature rather than a flaw."
