{
  "purpose": "A polling utility that repeatedly calls a condition function until it returns true or a timeout occurs, with configurable parameters.",
  "sources": "The condition function `func`, and the customizable functions `getnow` and `getsleep` used for time retrieval and sleeping.",
  "sinks": "The `func` condition function, which could be untrusted if replaced maliciously, and the customizable functions `getnow` and `getsleep`.",
  "flows": "The code calls `func()` repeatedly, with delays controlled by `getsleep()`, and checks `getnow()` to determine if the timeout has been exceeded.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; the only notable aspect is the customizable `getnow` and `getsleep` functions, which are standard for testability but could be misused if replaced maliciously.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard polling mechanism with configurable timeout, sleep interval, and exception handling. It uses standard Python modules (`time`) and allows dependency injection for `getnow` and `getsleep`. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic are present. The exception class `TimeOutWaitingFor` signals timeout events. The default instance `wait` provides a reusable polling object. The design is straightforward, flexible, and safe, with minimal security concerns. The only potential risk is if the user replaces `getnow` or `getsleep` with malicious functions, but this is an intended feature for testing and not an inherent vulnerability.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured polling utility with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's characteristics. The overall security risk is very low, primarily related to potential misuse if functions are replaced maliciously, which is an expected feature rather than a flaw.",
