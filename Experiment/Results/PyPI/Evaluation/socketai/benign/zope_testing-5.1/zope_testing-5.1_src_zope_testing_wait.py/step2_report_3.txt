  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code provided.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Implements a `Wait` class for polling a condition function (`func`) until it returns true or a timeout occurs.\n- Uses customizable functions `getnow` and `getsleep`, defaulting to `time.time` and `time.sleep`.\n- Raises a custom exception `TimeOutWaitingFor` if timeout is reached.\n- The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- The `wait` instance provides a default, reusable object.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  No, the code does not contain any malicious or suspicious logic. It is a standard polling utility.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- The code appears correct and well-structured. No flaws or mistakes are evident in the logic, reasoning, or summary.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and not obfuscated.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0 or very low (0.2). Given the code's benign nature, 0 is justified.\n\n### Potential Issues:\n- The reports mention that the customizable `getnow` and `getsleep` functions could be replaced maliciously if used improperly. However, this is an expected feature for testing and flexibility, not an inherent security flaw.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The reports are consistent in their assessments, all correctly identifying the code as benign.\n- No report suggests any suspicious or malicious activity.\n- The code's logic is straightforward and safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** Given the benign nature, I would assign a risk score of **0**.\n\n**Overall, this code is a standard polling utility with no malicious intent or security concerns.**",
