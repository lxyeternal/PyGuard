{
  "purpose": "Provides a class `Wait` for polling a condition until it becomes true or a timeout occurs, with a default instance `wait`.",
  "sources": "Import of the `time` module; lambda functions for getting current time and sleeping; class methods and attributes.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include any explicit sinks such as network communication, file writing, or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "The `__call__` method calls `func()` repeatedly, with delays controlled by `sleep()`, until success or timeout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Use of lambda functions for `getnow` and `getsleep` appears flexible but harmless. No obfuscated code or unusual logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a polling mechanism encapsulated in the `Wait` class. It uses standard library `time` functions, allowing customizable time retrieval and sleep functions. The class raises a custom exception if the condition isn't met within the specified timeout. No code performs network access, data leaks, or other malicious activities. No suspicious code patterns or anomalies are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard polling utility with no malicious intent. It is well-structured and does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior. No security concerns arise from this code.",
