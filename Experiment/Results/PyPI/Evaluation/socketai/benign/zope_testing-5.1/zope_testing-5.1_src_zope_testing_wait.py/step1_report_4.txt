{
  "purpose": "Provide a class and instance for polling a condition until it becomes true or a timeout occurs.",
  "sources": "The class Wait reads no external data; it uses internal methods, defaulting to time.time and time.sleep.",
  "sinks": "No external or untrusted data sinks are present; the code only calls standard library functions.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; the code polls a condition function and potentially raises an exception upon timeout.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are detected. The exception class is customizable but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a polling utility with configurable timeout, wait interval, exception, and functions for current time and sleep. It uses standard library functions. No external data input, output, or suspicious behavior identified. The structure is straightforward, with no hidden or malicious logic. No signs of data leakage, code injection, or malicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign polling utility class with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It provides standard polling functionality using safe, well-known techniques. No security risks identified.",
