{
  "purpose": "Provides a class and instance for polling a condition until it becomes true or a timeout occurs.",
  "sources": "The class uses the built-in time module; getnow and getsleep functions are customizable.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not perform network operations, file writes, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "The flow involves calling a function repeatedly with delays, checking for success, or raising an exception upon timeout.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with configurable parameters and no hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Wait class that polls a condition function periodically, with configurable timeout, wait interval, and exception. It uses lambda functions for getnow and getsleep, defaulting to time.time and time.sleep. The wait instance is a default, reusable object. There are no external data sources or sinks, no suspicious or obfuscated logic, and no network or system manipulation. The code appears to be a utility for polling with safe and standard Python features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign polling utility with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain obfuscation, malware, or security concerns.",
