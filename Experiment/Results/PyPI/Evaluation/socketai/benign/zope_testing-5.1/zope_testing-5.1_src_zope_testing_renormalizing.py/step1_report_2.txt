{
  "purpose": "The code provides an extension to Python's doctest framework to support advanced output normalization and pattern-based output transformations in doctests.",
  "sources": "Imports the 'doctest' module, uses class constructors, methods, and patterns passed as arguments, especially in '_cook' method.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external output manipulation; no network, file, or environment interactions present.",
  "flows": "Input patterns → '_cook' method transforms patterns → 'check_output' and 'output_difference' methods apply transformers to 'want' and 'got' outputs for comparison.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated logic. The code performs pattern transformations and output comparisons only.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'OutputChecker' extending 'doctest.OutputChecker' to normalize test output using regex patterns or callables. Patterns are compiled or stored as functions, applied during output checks and differences. Methods are straightforward, with no external or hidden actions. The code does not interact with external data sources, network, or files. It is a utility class for test output processing, with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign extension of the doctest framework for pattern-based output normalization. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no external data handling, and performs solely in-memory transformations for testing purposes.",
