  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for output normalization in doctests. It does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only external risk relates to the patterns supplied, which is outside the code's control. Overall, the security risk is negligible, and the scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate."
