{
  "purpose": "This code provides support for advanced normalization of output in doctests, allowing pattern-based output transformations.",
  "sources": "Input data in the form of patterns for transformation, and the 'want' and 'got' strings in output comparison methods.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any apparent sinks that lead to data leaks, system commands, or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Patterns are compiled and stored as transformers, which are applied to 'want' and 'got''. The output_difference method modifies the 'want' for comparison, but does not execute or send data elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior are present. The code implements standard pattern matching and output normalization without obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard 'doctest' module and defines a class for output normalization using regex patterns or callables. Methods override output checking and difference reporting, applying transformations in a controlled manner. The class supports combining transformers via addition. There are no system calls, network operations, or security-sensitive actions. No obfuscated code or malicious logic identified. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate utility for testing purposes, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, utility class for normalizing doctest outputs. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard implementation with no suspicious activity.",
