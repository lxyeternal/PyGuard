  "purpose": "Provides advanced normalization of doctest output by applying pattern-based transformations to ensure consistent output comparison.",
  "sources": "Patterns provided during initialization, which can be regex tuples or callables, applied to output strings during check and difference reporting.",
  "sinks": "Internal string transformations; no external data or system interactions.",
  "flows": "Input patterns -> stored as transformers -> applied to 'want' and 'got' strings during check_output and output_difference methods.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward pattern application. External pattern injection could pose misuse if patterns are malicious, but this is outside the code's scope.",
  "analysis": "The class extends doctest.OutputChecker to normalize output strings via user-supplied patterns, which are stored as functions or regex substitutions. It applies these transformations during output comparison and difference reporting. The code does not perform any network, file, or system operations, nor does it contain obfuscation or malicious code. The main potential risk is if malicious patterns or callables are supplied externally, which could lead to code execution or unintended behavior, but this is an external input concern, not an inherent flaw. The code is simple, safe, and intended for testing utilities, with no evident security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for output normalization in doctests. It does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only external risk relates to the patterns supplied, which is outside the code's control. Overall, the security risk is negligible, and the scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate.",
