{
  "purpose": "Support for advanced normalization of output in doctests, providing pattern-based output checking and normalization.",
  "sources": "Patterns passed to the OutputChecker constructor, specifically the 'patterns' parameter, and method inputs such as 'want', 'got', and 'example.want'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially malicious transformation functions if 'patterns' contain malicious callables or malicious regex replacements, but no direct dangerous sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Patterns are stored as transformers and applied to 'want' and 'got' during output checking and difference calculations, influencing output comparisons.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic pattern transformation functions that could be manipulated if pattern input is malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for normalizing doctest outputs by applying user-provided regex patterns or callables. It initializes transformers from patterns, supports addition with other normalization objects, and applies transformations during output checks. The logic is straightforward and primarily for output normalization, with no network or file I/O, no execution of external commands, and no use of sensitive data or credentials. The only potential concern is if malicious patterns or callables are injected, but this is outside the scope of the provided code, which accepts patterns as parameters. No obfuscation or malware-like behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of pattern-based output normalization for doctests. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. Its design relies on external input for patterns, which could be misused if patterns are malicious, but the code itself is benign.",
