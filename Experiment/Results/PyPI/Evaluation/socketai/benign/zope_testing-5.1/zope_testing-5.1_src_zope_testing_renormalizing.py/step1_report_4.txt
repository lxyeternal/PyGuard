{
  "purpose": "Provide advanced normalization of output in doctests to allow flexible pattern matching.",
  "sources": "Import of the doctest module, class methods, and internal patterns/transformations.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data outputs observed; transformations are limited to regex substitutions and internal data manipulation.",
  "flows": "Input patterns are stored, transformed, and used within class methods; no external network or system interaction present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or suspicious behaviors detected. Use of regex transformations is standard for output normalization.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of doctest.OutputChecker to normalize and compare output strings by applying regex-based transformations. The class provides methods for checking output and reporting differences, with mechanisms for pattern transformations. There are no indications of malicious code, external data exfiltration, or harmful behavior. The code appears to be a utility for testing purposes, with standard implementation patterns. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility designed to normalize doctest outputs through pattern replacements. It contains no malicious intent, no external data handling, and no security risks. It appears safe and suitable for its intended purpose.",
