{
  "purpose": "The code provides support for advanced normalization of output in doctests, enabling pattern-based output transformations to improve test reliability.",
  "sources": "The code reads patterns for output transformation from initialization parameters, and input/output data during the check_output and output_difference methods.",
  "sinks": "The code does not directly handle untrusted data; it mainly processes patterns and strings within the testing framework. No data is sent over networks or stored insecurely.",
  "flows": "Patterns provided during initialization are transformed into functions; these are applied to 'want' and 'got' strings during output checking and difference calculation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present. The code primarily uses standard libraries and pattern matching for normalization.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an OutputChecker class for normalizing test output, utilizing pattern substitutions via regex. It includes methods for checking output equality and differences, applying transformations, and combining with other checkers. All operations involve string processing within a controlled testing environment. No external data sources, network operations, or file manipulations are present. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or malicious patterns. It appears to be a well-defined utility for testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign testing utility for output normalization in doctests. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is standard and safe within its intended scope.",
