  "purpose": "Configuration setup for building Sphinx documentation for zope.testing project.",
  "sources": "Imports os, sys, pkg_resources; environment variable 'PURE_PYTHON'; dependency requirement 'zope.testing'; sys.path modification.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows, external communications, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "Static configuration steps without data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward and typical for documentation build scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static configuration script for Sphinx documentation. It imports standard modules, sets an environment variable, modifies sys.path, and fetches dependency info using pkg_resources. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The environment variable 'PURE_PYTHON' is a common build flag, and no external network activity or dynamic code execution occurs. The code is well-structured, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard configuration script for documentation generation with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments and scores in all reports are accurate and justified.",
