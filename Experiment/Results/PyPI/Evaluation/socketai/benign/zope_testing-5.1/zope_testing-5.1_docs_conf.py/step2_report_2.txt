  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard Sphinx configuration script.\n- No untrusted input handling, network communication, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The only notable activity is setting environment variables and modifying sys.path, which are typical in build scripts.\n- Use of `pkg_resources.require()` is standard for dependency version checks.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or backdoors.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk of 0, which is consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The environment variable `'PURE_PYTHON'` is set to `'1'`. While somewhat unusual, this is a common configuration directive for controlling build modes and is not malicious.\n- The code is purely configuration for documentation generation; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.\n- No evidence of code injection, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior.\n\n**Score assessments:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as the code is straightforward and transparent.\n- **Risk score:** Given the benign nature, all reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No changes needed to the scoring.\n- The code is a standard, safe configuration script with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Final justification:** The code is a static configuration script for documentation purposes, with no malicious or suspicious elements. All observed activities are typical for such scripts and do not pose security risks.",
