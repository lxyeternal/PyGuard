  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for namespace package declaration; no unusual or suspicious code features.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and calls 'declare_namespace' on the current module, which is a common pattern for namespace packages in Python. It does not involve any user input, environment variables, or data transmission. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious backdoors, or malicious behavior. The code appears to be a legitimate package declaration statement.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace declaration with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
