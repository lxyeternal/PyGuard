  "purpose": "Namespace declaration for Python package using pkg_resources",
  "sources": "Importing 'pkg_resources' module and calling declare_namespace(__name__)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, no data leaks, no network or dynamic code execution",
  "flows": "Import of 'pkg_resources' -> call to declare_namespace(__name__)",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a standard namespace declaration pattern",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and declares a namespace for the current module. It is a minimal, standard pattern used in Python packaging to define namespace packages. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data handling involving untrusted sources. The code does not perform any network operations, dynamic execution, or data leaks. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with high confidence and appropriate scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign namespace declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns. All reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications to scores are necessary.",
