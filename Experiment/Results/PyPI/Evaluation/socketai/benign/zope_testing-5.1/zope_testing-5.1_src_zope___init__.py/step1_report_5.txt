  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no suspicious or unusual code structures, obfuscation, or malicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and declares the current package as a namespace package, which is a common pattern in Python package management. It does not include any dynamic execution, hardcoded secrets, network communication, or other suspicious behavior. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The code is a standard practice for namespace package declaration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and serves a standard purpose in Python package management. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
