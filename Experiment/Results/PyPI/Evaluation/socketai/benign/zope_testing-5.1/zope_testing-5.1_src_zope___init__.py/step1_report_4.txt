  "purpose": "Declare a namespace package using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and calls declare_namespace with __name__.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or output data.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from source to sink is present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for namespace package declaration; no suspicious or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkg_resources' module and calls 'declare_namespace(__name__)', which is a common pattern for defining namespace packages in Python. This is a standard practice in package management and does not exhibit malicious behavior. There are no hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, network operations, or other suspicious activities. The code is straightforward and appears to serve the purpose of setting up namespace packages without any obfuscation or hidden functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard namespace package declaration using 'pkg_resources'. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The code is benign and serves a typical package management purpose.",
