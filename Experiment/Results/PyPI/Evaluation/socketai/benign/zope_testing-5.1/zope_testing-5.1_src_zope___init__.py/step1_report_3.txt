  "purpose": "Declare the current package as a namespace package using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "Import statement (__import__('pkg_resources'))",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; the code primarily declares namespace packaging.",
  "flows": "Importing pkg_resources -> declaring namespace",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no suspicious behavior or unusual patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkg_resources' module using the __import__ function and declares the current package as a namespace package with declare_namespace. This is a standard approach in Python packaging to allow multiple distributions to share a common namespace. No dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials, or data leaks are present. The code does not perform any network operations, data processing, or obfuscation. Overall, the code is simple and typical for namespace declaration, with no signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a standard namespace declaration for Python packages and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and typical for modular package structures.",
