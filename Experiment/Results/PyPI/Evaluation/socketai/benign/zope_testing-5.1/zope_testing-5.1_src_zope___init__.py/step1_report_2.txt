  "purpose": "Declare the current package as a namespace package using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'pkg_resources' module and calls declare_namespace(__name__).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no data leaks or harmful actions evident.",
  "flows": "Importing 'pkg_resources' and executing declare_namespace(__name__) without additional code; no data flow occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; standard namespace declaration. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a well-known library 'pkg_resources' and declares the module as a namespace package. This is a common pattern used in Python packaging to allow multiple distributions to contribute to the same namespace. The line is straightforward and does not perform any malicious actions or contain hidden behaviors. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard namespace declaration code used in Python packaging, with no indications of malicious intent or security issues.",
