  "purpose": "Manage caching of the 'admin_interface_theme' setting using Django's caching framework.",
  "sources": "Reading settings.CACHES to determine cache configuration, reading from cache with get, and setting cache with set.",
  "sinks": "Cache delete, get, and set methods which could potentially affect stored data.",
  "flows": "Code reads cache configuration -> accesses cache -> reads/writes/deletes 'admin_interface_theme' key.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscated code. No direct user input handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages cache entries for a theme setting, with functions to delete, retrieve, and set a cache value. It dynamically chooses cache backend based on settings, which is standard. No suspicious data flow or external network activity is present. No hardcoded credentials or secrets. The code's logic is straightforward and aligns with common cache management patterns in Django. No malicious intent or security issues are evident. The code assumes safe usage within Django's framework, and all data manipulations are confined to cache operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign cache management utility for Django, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
