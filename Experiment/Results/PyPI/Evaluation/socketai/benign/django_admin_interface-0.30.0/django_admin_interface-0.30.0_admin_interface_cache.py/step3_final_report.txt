  "purpose": "Manage caching of 'admin_interface_theme' using Django's cache framework, providing functions to get, set, and delete the cache entry.",
  "sources": "Reading cache configuration from settings.CACHES; accessing cache via Django's cache API; using 'theme' parameter as cache value.",
  "sinks": "Cache get/set/delete operations; no external data or secrets involved.",
  "flows": "Configuration check in 'app_cache()' -> cache delete/get/set functions -> cache key 'admin_interface_theme' with 'theme' value.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, utilizing Django's cache API to manage a specific cache key. It checks for a custom cache 'admin_interface' and defaults to the standard cache. No untrusted data processing, no external communication, and no obfuscation are present. The functions perform simple cache operations, and the 'theme' parameter is assumed to be controlled internally. No malicious behavior or vulnerabilities are evident. The security risk is minimal, and the malware likelihood is zero. The code's clarity and standard usage indicate a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard cache management utility with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores are appropriate; malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 (reflecting minimal cache-related concerns). Overall, the code is safe and benign.",
