  "purpose": "Manage and cache the active theme for the admin interface in a Django application.",
  "sources": "Reading settings.CACHES to determine cache configuration; reading cache keys 'admin_interface_theme'.",
  "sinks": "Cache delete, get, and set operations potentially exposing or modifying cached data.",
  "flows": "From reading cache configuration -> cache delete/get/set operations affecting 'admin_interface_theme'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code patterns, no obfuscated code, and no external data handling or network activity. The code simply manages cache keys.",
  "analysis": "The code interacts solely with Django's cache framework, reading configuration to select a cache backend and performing cache operations on a specific key. All actions are typical cache manipulations with no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. There are no hardcoded secrets, external network calls, or unusual code patterns. The functions provide straightforward caching functionality for the admin theme setting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard cache management implementation within a Django project, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions to cache and retrieve the admin theme setting securely.",
