  "purpose": "Manage caching of the 'admin_interface_theme' setting in a Django application.",
  "sources": "Reading from settings.CACHES to determine cache backend; getting data from cache with app_cache().get.",
  "sinks": "Cache delete, get, and set methods that could modify or retrieve cached data.",
  "flows": "Code checks for 'admin_interface' cache configuration -> accesses cache -> deletes/sets/gets 'admin_interface_theme' key.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious data flows. Use of standard Django cache API is typical; no unusual or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to select a cache backend based on settings and perform simple get/set/delete operations on the cache for a theme setting. It does not process untrusted input, execute system commands, or communicate over the network. The logic appears straightforward and aligned with typical caching practices. No anomalies, secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of cache management for a specific setting, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on Django's cache framework without any unusual or harmful modifications.",
