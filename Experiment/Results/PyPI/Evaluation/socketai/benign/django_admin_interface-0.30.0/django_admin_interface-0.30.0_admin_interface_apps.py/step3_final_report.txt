  "purpose": "Defines a Django AppConfig subclass for the 'admin_interface' app, setting metadata and invoking a settings check during startup.",
  "sources": "Import of 'settings' within 'ready()' method, calling 'settings.check_installed_apps()'.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution within 'settings.check_installed_apps()' depending on its implementation; no direct sinks in the provided code.",
  "flows": "From import of 'settings' to invocation of 'check_installed_apps()' during app initialization.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward Django pattern. The only unknown is the behavior of 'settings.check_installed_apps()'.",
  "analysis": "The code is standard Django application configuration with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The call to 'settings.check_installed_apps()' depends on its implementation, which is not provided. The code itself appears benign, and the reports correctly identify it as routine setup code. No malicious activity or security issues are evident from the snippet. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, low risk ~0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the information. The main concern is the behavior of 'check_installed_apps()', but without further details, it cannot be assessed as malicious. Overall, the code is safe, and the low scores are justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django app configuration class with no signs of malicious or security issues. The invocation of 'settings.check_installed_apps()' is typical for setup routines. Given the lack of evidence for malicious behavior, the malware score remains at 0, obfuscation at 0, and the security risk is very low (~0.1). Further review of 'check_installed_apps()' is recommended if possible, but based solely on this snippet, the code is safe.",
