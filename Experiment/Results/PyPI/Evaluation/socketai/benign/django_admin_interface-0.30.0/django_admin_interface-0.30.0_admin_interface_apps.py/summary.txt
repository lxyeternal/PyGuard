  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django app configuration class with no signs of malicious or security issues. The invocation of 'settings.check_installed_apps()' is typical for setup routines. Given the lack of evidence for malicious behavior, the malware score remains at 0, obfuscation at 0, and the security risk is very low (~0.1). Further review of 'check_installed_apps()' is recommended if possible, but based solely on this snippet, the code is safe."
