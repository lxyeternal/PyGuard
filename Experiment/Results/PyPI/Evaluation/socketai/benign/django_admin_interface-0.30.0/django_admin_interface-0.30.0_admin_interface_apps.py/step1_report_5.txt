  "purpose": "Define a Django application configuration for the 'admin_interface' app and perform a setup check when ready.",
  "sources": "Import statements: 'django.apps', 'django.utils.translation', and 'admin_interface.settings' in the 'ready' method.",
  "sinks": "The call to 'settings.check_installed_apps()' in the 'ready' method.",
  "flows": "Import 'settings' in 'ready', then invoke 'settings.check_installed_apps()'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious strings or unusual patterns. The 'check_installed_apps' method's implementation is unknown but assumed to be a standard setup check.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django AppConfig subclass with a 'ready' method that imports a 'settings' module from the same app and calls 'check_installed_apps'. There are no signs of malicious code such as network calls, file system access, or data exfiltration. The code appears standard for Django apps. Without the implementation of 'check_installed_apps', no malicious activity can be confirmed, and the code structure is typical.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django application configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs a setup check during app startup, which is normal. No suspicious or malicious activity detected.",
