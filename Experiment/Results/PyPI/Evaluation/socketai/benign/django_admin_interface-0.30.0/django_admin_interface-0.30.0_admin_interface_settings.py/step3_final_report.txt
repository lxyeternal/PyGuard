  "purpose": "The code performs configuration validation for Django applications by checking if specific apps are installed based on the Django version, raising exceptions if conditions are not met.",
  "sources": "Reads 'django.VERSION' and 'settings.INSTALLED_APPS' for validation logic.",
  "sinks": "Raises 'ImproperlyConfigured' exceptions when validation fails, which are standard for configuration errors.",
  "flows": "Source data ('django.VERSION' and 'settings.INSTALLED_APPS') flow into conditional checks that may trigger exception raising.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Django configuration validation script that checks app presence relative to Django version. It uses standard APIs and exception handling without external inputs or malicious patterns. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is present. The logic is typical for Django projects, and the exception messages are standard. No security vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident. The code's purpose is purely to ensure correct app configuration, with minimal security impact. The exception raising could disrupt application startup if misconfigured but does not pose a security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Django configuration validation utility with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The provided reports correctly identify its purpose and safety, and the assigned scores are appropriate. There is no evidence of supply chain attack vectors or malicious sabotage.",
