{
  "purpose": "The code checks the presence or absence of specific Django apps in the project settings based on Django version constraints.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Django version via django.VERSION and reads the settings.INSTALLED_APPS list.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or potentially harmful actions are present.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves checking whether an app is in INSTALLED_APPS and raising exceptions if conditions are not met.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are present. The logic is straightforward and typical for configuration validation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django modules and defines functions to validate app dependencies relative to Django version. It performs version and app presence checks, raising exceptions for misconfigurations. The checks are standard and do not involve dynamic code execution or data manipulation beyond configuration validation. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code are evident. No external data sources, network activity, or file manipulations are involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django application configuration validation snippet with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is designed solely for ensuring correct app dependencies based on Django version, with no evidence of supply chain attacks or malware.",
