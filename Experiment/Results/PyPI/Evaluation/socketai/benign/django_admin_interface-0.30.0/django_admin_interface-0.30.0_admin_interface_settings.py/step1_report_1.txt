{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to check the presence or absence of a specified Django app in the project's settings based on the Django version, to ensure proper configuration.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Django version from django.VERSION and the list of installed apps from settings.INSTALLED_APPS.",
  "sinks": "The code raises ImproperlyConfigured exceptions, which could potentially be exploited if an attacker controls the app name or the environment, but this is standard behavior for configuration validation.",
  "flows": "Input flows from external environment variables and project settings into the version and app checks, with the exception raising as the output for misconfiguration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns are present; the code performs standard configuration validation tasks. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code checks whether specific apps are installed depending on the Django version, raising exceptions if the configuration does not meet expected conditions. It uses standard Django practices, reads from settings and django.VERSION, and raises exceptions with formatted messages. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious logic. The code does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or hidden activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration validation script for Django projects, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs expected checks for app installation consistency across Django versions.",
