{
  "purpose": "To verify the presence or absence of a specific Django app ('colorfield') in the project's settings based on the Django version.",
  "sources": "Reading from 'django.VERSION' and 'settings.INSTALLED_APPS'.",
  "sinks": "Potential improper configuration raises 'ImproperlyConfigured' exceptions, which could disrupt application startup if misused.",
  "flows": "Code reads version info and installed apps, then conditionally raises exceptions based on app presence and Django version.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. Usage of exception raising is standard for configuration checks. No obfuscated code or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard configuration validation tasks for a Django project. It compares the current Django version with a specified maximum version and checks if an app is included or excluded accordingly. The logic is straightforward and uses proper exception handling for misconfigurations. No input data is taken from untrusted sources; the data used (Django version, settings) are trusted internal variables. No suspicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration check script for Django applications. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is safe and serves a legitimate purpose. No anomalies or security concerns are identified.",
