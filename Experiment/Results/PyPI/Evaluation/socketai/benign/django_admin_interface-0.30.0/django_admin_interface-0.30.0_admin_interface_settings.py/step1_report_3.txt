{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to verify the presence or absence of specific Django applications in the project settings based on Django version constraints.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'settings.INSTALLED_APPS' list and the 'django.VERSION' tuple.",
  "targets": "The code raises exceptions if certain conditions about installed apps and Django versions are not met, which could interrupt execution but does not directly lead to data leakage or system compromise.",
  "flows": "Input data from 'settings.INSTALLED_APPS' and 'django.VERSION' flow into conditional checks that raise exceptions if conditions are not satisfied.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. The code uses standard Django framework features. No obfuscation or malicious code is detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs version-based checks on installed Django applications. It uses standard Django APIs and exception handling to enforce configuration rules. There are no indications of malicious intent, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The logic is straightforward and intended for configuration validation. No suspicious network activity, credential theft, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple validation script for Django project configuration with no malicious or security-compromising behavior. It appears to be a legitimate utility for maintaining proper application setup.",
