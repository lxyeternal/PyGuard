  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code checks whether a specified Django app is installed or not, depending on the Django version.\n- It raises `ImproperlyConfigured` exceptions if the configuration does not meet the specified criteria.\n- It uses standard Django APIs (`django.VERSION`, `settings.INSTALLED_APPS`) and straightforward logic.\n- No external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is involved.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Findings:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code. It performs standard configuration validation.\n- **Malware or malicious intent:** None detected. The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, as it is just validation logic.\n\n### Critical Evaluation of the Reports:\nAll five reports agree on the following:\n- The purpose is to validate app presence based on Django version.\n- The sources are trusted internal variables.\n- The sinks are exception raises, which are standard for configuration validation.\n- No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated logic are detected.\n- The overall analysis aligns with the code's behavior: standard, safe, and intended for configuration validation.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:** Ranges from 0 to 0.2, which is reasonable given the code's nature. The highest is 0.2, possibly reflecting that misconfiguration could disrupt application startup, but it does not pose a security threat.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final System-Level Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (low, as it could cause application misbehavior but not security breach)\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\nGiven the analysis, I would assign:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, related to misconfiguration, not security breach)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard Django configuration validation script with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.",
