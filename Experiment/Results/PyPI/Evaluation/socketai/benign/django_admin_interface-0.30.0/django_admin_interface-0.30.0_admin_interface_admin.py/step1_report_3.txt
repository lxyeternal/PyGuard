  "purpose": "This code defines an admin interface customization for the Theme model in Django's admin panel, primarily configuring how theme-related data is displayed and edited.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the Theme model's fields such as name, active, env_name, env_color, logo, favicon, title, various CSS color fields, and interface toggles.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data handling occurs. The code does not perform network requests, execute system commands, or handle sensitive data beyond model field values.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the database fields (sources) to the admin interface UI elements, allowing user modifications, with no evident data processing or transmission outside the database.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual code constructs are present. The code is straightforward Django admin configuration, with no obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django admin registration for the Theme model, specifying display options, editable fields, and organized fieldsets for admin UI. It uses standard Django practices with no dynamic code execution, external inputs, or insecure operations. The code is purely declarative, configuring the admin interface; it does not process untrusted input, connect externally, or perform actions that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical Django admin customization script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic. It appears to serve its intended purpose without security concerns.",
