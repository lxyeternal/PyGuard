  "purpose": "Django admin registration and configuration for the Theme model, setting display options, fieldsets, and interface behavior.",
  "sources": "Static code defining admin interface options; no external data sources or dynamic input handling.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processed or external communication performed.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, declarative, and uses standard Django patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django admin registration for the Theme model, involving configuration of display fields, fieldsets, and interface options. It does not include any dynamic code execution, external data handling, or suspicious patterns. The use of translation functions is typical for internationalization. There are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or external network interactions. The code is purely declarative and configuration-oriented, with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Django admin setup with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score should be 0, reflecting its safe and static nature.",
