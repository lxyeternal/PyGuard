  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical operations or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs. Usage of translation functions is standard. No suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code registers a Theme model with Django's admin interface, specifying display, editing, and layout options. It uses standard Django modules and translation functions for labels, with no input processing, external data handling, or network interactions. The structure is typical for Django admin configurations, and there are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward Django admin configuration for Theme management, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
