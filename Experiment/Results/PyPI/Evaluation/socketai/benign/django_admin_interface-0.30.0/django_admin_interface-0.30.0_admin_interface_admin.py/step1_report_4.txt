  "purpose": "Define a custom admin interface for the Theme model in a Django project.",
  "sources": "Import statements for Django admin and translation modules; Theme model from admin_interface.models.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external network calls; the code only configures admin interface options.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; purely configuration of admin interface fields and display.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or unusual code constructs detected. The code is standard Django admin configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code registers a Theme model with the Django admin site and customizes its admin interface with fieldsets, list displays, and other options. It uses translation functions for labels but does not process user input, handle external data, or execute code dynamically. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious logic. All imported modules are standard Django components or well-known third-party apps. The configuration appears benign, focusing solely on UI layout and display options.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard Django admin registration with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It functions purely as configuration for admin interface appearance and behavior.",
