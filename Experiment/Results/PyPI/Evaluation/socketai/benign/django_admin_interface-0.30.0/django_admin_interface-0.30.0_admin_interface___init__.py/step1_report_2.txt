  "purpose": "Import metadata attributes from the admin_interface.metadata module and define public API symbols.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'admin_interface.metadata' module to import specific metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sources or sinks; the code only imports static module attributes.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; it only assigns imported attributes to __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behavior; no hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward imports of module-level metadata variables and defines the __all__ list for exports. There are no dynamic code executions, data leaks, or obfuscated patterns. The imports appear to be standard for package metadata management.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and purely manages package metadata. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
