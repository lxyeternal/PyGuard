  "purpose": "This code defines module metadata attributes and an __all__ list for the admin_interface.metadata module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from admin_interface.metadata, attribute definitions (__author__, __copyright__, etc.), __all__ list initialization.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Import flows data into module attributes, then these attributes are listed in __all__, with no data flow to external sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code solely contains metadata definitions and an export list.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several metadata variables from a module and defines an __all__ list for exports. There are no user inputs, external data reads, or suspicious operations. No dynamic code, obfuscation, or external connections are present. This appears to be a standard metadata module setup with no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, defining metadata attributes and an export list without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It is a standard, benign module setup.",
