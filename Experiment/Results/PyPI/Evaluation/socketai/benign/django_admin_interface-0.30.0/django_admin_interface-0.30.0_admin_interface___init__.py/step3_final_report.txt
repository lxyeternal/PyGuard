  "purpose": "This code module imports package metadata variables from 'admin_interface.metadata' and exports them via __all__ for public API exposure.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from 'admin_interface.metadata' for metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or data sinks; static code with no external data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A - static import and export; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static import/export pattern with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports predefined metadata variables and defines __all__ to expose them. It contains no dynamic code, user input, network activity, or data processing. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and static nature justify these scores. No vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or obfuscation are present. The scores are consistent with the code's purpose and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless module for managing package metadata, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
