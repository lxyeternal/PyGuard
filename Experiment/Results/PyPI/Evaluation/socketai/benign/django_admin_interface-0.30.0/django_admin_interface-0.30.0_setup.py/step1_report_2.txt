{
  "purpose": "To facilitate the installation and distribution of a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'setup' function from the 'setuptools' library.",
  "sinks": "The code calls the 'setup()' function, which is a known entry point for package setup procedures.",
  "flows": "The source is the import of 'setup', which is then invoked directly within the main block, leading to package setup actions.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimalistic, with no hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious operations. No obfuscated or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setup' from 'setuptools' and executes it if the script is run as the main program. This is a standard pattern in Python packaging scripts. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code performs a benign, expected function for package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical, straightforward setup script for a Python package with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
