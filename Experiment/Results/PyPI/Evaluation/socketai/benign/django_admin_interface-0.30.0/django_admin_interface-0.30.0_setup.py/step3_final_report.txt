  "purpose": "Minimal setup script for Python package configuration.",
  "sources": "Import statement from setuptools; execution within __main__ guard.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows; no network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Import of setup function, invocation in main guard; no data flow beyond standard function call.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, standard setup script importing 'setup' from 'setuptools' and calling it within the '__main__' guard. It contains no user input, data leaks, network activity, or obfuscated code. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are present, and the code aligns with typical packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python packaging script with no security risks or malicious intent. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
