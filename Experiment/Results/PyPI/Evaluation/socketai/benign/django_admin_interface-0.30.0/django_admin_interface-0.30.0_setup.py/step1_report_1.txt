  "purpose": "To configure and run the setuptools setup process for a Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module name and the environment to determine whether to execute setup.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function, which is a standard part of the setuptools library, is called to perform package setup; it does not appear to leak data or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "The script checks if __name__ == '__main__' and then calls setup(), representing a simple control flow with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal, straightforward, and contains no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the setuptools library and invokes its setup() function within a main guard. This is a common pattern for Python package setup scripts. The code does not include any user input handling, data leaks, or malicious behavior. It does not contain obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign setup script for a Python package. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in the provided code.",
