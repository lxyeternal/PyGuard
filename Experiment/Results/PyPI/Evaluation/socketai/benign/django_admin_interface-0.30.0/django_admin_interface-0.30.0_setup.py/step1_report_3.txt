  "purpose": "This code is used to define the setup configuration for a Python package, typically for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "The code reads the '__main__' environment and imports the 'setup' function from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "The code flow is limited to executing the setup() function if run as a script, with no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns present. The code is minimal and standard for packaging.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports the setup function and calls it when executed as the main program. No user input, no network activity, and no malicious behavior are present. The purpose is typical package configuration, and it does not contain any suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This is standard packaging code with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
