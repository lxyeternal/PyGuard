  "sinks": "No sinks such as network calls, file writes, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "The flow simply executes 'setup()' when run as the main program, with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, standard, and lacks any suspicious or unusual constructs, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "This is a straightforward setup script typical for Python packaging. It imports the 'setup' function and calls it within the main block. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code's simplicity and standard structure indicate it is a benign setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python setup script with no malicious behavior or security concerns detected.",
