  "sources": "Database fields, file upload validators, signal handlers for cache management.",
  "sinks": "Database writes, cache invalidation functions, signal triggers.",
  "flows": "Signal handlers trigger cache deletion and theme activation updates upon save or delete events.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. File validators restrict upload types appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django model with signal handlers for cache invalidation and theme activation management. It uses validators to prevent malicious uploads. No external network calls, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated patterns are present. The logic is straightforward, adhering to best practices, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, secure Django theme management module with no malicious or obfuscated code. The risk is minimal, primarily related to file uploads which are properly validated. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and overall security risk is 0.",
