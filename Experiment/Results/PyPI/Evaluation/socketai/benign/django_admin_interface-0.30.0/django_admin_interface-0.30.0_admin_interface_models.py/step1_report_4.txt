{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Django model for managing themes in an admin interface, including logic for setting active themes and handling related signals.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from models (database queries), environment variables (via Django settings), and input data through model fields such as 'name' and 'active'.",
  "sinks": "Database updates (saving model instances, updating 'active' status), and cache invalidation functions ('del_cached_active_theme') which may trigger cache refreshes.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user inputs or database queries through model methods and signals, potentially updating 'active' theme status and invalidating cache.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. No suspicious external network activity, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior is evident. Signal handlers perform cache invalidation and manage active theme state, which are typical operations.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard Django model logic with custom querysets and signal handlers for managing theme activation states. It reads and writes to the database, validates file extensions for logo and favicon uploads, and manages theme states. No hidden network operations, data exfiltration, or malicious code patterns are detected. The cache invalidation functions suggest proper cache management. Overall, the code is straightforward, with typical Django patterns, and does not contain malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django model implementation for theme management with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs normal operations such as updating database records, invalidating cache, and handling signals. There are no signs of supply chain attacks, backdoors, or malicious code.",
