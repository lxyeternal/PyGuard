{
  "purpose": "Defines a Theme model for configuring admin interface appearance, including colors, logos, and behavior settings, with signals to manage cache and active themes.",
  "sources": "Reads data from model fields such as name, active, and various color and file fields; reads data during save and delete operations via signals.",
  "sinks": "No apparent data sinks for untrusted data; file uploads are validated for extensions, but no direct use of untrusted input in a vulnerable way.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user input into model fields, with signals updating cache and active theme status. No external data flows or network activity observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, backdoors, or malicious patterns detected. The code uses standard Django features and validation.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages theme configurations with model fields, validation, and signals to update cache and active status. No signs of malicious code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious logic. File validation is in place to restrict extensions. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or network communications are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard Django model implementation for theme management with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It operates within expected patterns for a Django application, with appropriate validation and signal handling.",
