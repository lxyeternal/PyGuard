  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its behavior, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a Django model for theme configuration, with signals for cache invalidation. Correctly identifies ORM data flow.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscated code, no external network activity. Uses standard Django practices.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-founded; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's assessment is accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar theme management with signals, standard data flows.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, no external network activity, proper validation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid; code is straightforward.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seems slightly cautious but acceptable given the nature of the code.\n\n**Verdict:** The risk score of 0.2 is reasonable, considering minimal potential for misconfiguration but no actual malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar theme configuration code.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns, no obfuscation, no network activity.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correct.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is accurate; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard theme management, cache invalidation.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, no external calls, standard Django practices.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 are suitable.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar theme configuration code.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior, no obfuscation, no external network activity.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-justified.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. Given the code's nature, malware should remain at **0**.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; scores of **0** are correct.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly conservative at 0.1-0.2 in some reports, which is reasonable for code that involves file uploads and cache management but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** **0.0 to 0.1** (minimal risk, standard code for theme management)\n\n**Note:** The code is a typical Django model with signal handlers for cache invalidation and theme activation. No supply chain or security risks are evident. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and reasonable. No modifications needed. The code is safe, standard, and free of malicious intent.",
