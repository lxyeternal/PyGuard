{
  "purpose": "Defines a Django model for theme customization with various color and display options, including signals to handle active theme management and caching.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the database (Theme objects), form inputs for file uploads (logo, favicon), and model field defaults.",
  "sinks": "Database update operations, cache invalidation functions, and file upload validators.",
  "flows": "Model creation or update triggers cache invalidation and active theme setting, with possible read of existing theme data during save operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. Use of file validators and signals appears standard. No obfuscated code or external network activity is present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages theme data within a Django application, including fields for color customization, file uploads, and display options. Signal handlers ensure only one theme is active at a time and cache is cleared on changes. File validators restrict upload types, and the code uses standard Django practices. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, remote command execution, or backdoors are evident. The code appears to be straightforward application logic for theme management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django model implementation for managing themes with proper validation and signal handling. No malicious activity or sabotage is detected. The design aligns with typical application patterns, and no security risks or malware indications are present.",
