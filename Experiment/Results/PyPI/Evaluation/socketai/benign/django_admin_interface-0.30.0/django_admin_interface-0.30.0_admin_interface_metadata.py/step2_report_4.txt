  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Report 1:**\n   - The report indicates an \"Empty response\" with no data provided.\n   - No issues, flaws, or suspicious activity are identified.\n   - The code is simply static metadata variables.\n   - **Conclusion:** No malicious or security concerns here.\n\n2. **Report 2:**\n   - The report thoroughly describes the code as static metadata declarations.\n   - No sinks, flows, anomalies, or malicious activity detected.\n   - The analysis confirms the code is benign.\n   - **Scores assigned:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n   - **Assessment:** The scoring appears appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n3. **Reports 3-5:**\n   - All are \"Empty response\" with no data.\n   - No issues to evaluate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence:** The code is straightforward metadata, with no dynamic or executable components.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected; the code does not perform any network, file, or external interactions.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is clear and unobfuscated.\n- **Risks:** No vulnerabilities or security risks are evident.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's content.\n- No adjustments needed based on the current information.\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n\n- The \"Empty response\" reports suggest missing data, but based on the provided code snippet, there is no indication of issues.\n- If further code or context were provided, a deeper analysis might be warranted, but with current data, the assessment stands.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n| Metric             | Score | Justification                                                                                 |\n|--------------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0      | No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected.                          |\n| Obfuscated         | 0      | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation present.                                           |\n| Security Risk      | 0      | No vulnerabilities or risky behaviors identified.                                           |\n\n**Overall, the code is benign and safe.**",
