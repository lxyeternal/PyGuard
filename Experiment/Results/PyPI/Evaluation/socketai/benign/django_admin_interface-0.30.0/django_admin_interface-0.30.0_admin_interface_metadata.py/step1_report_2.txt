  "sources": "The code sources data from hardcoded string literals assigned to module-level variables (__author__, __copyright__, __description__, __email__, __license__, __title__, __version__).",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; no untrusted data, network communication, file I/O, or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; all data is static and hardcoded.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. The code strictly contains metadata assignments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments with static string literals, serving as package metadata. There are no functions, conditionals, loops, input/output operations, or dynamic code execution. The content is straightforward and typical for Python package modules. No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign and purely metadata with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
