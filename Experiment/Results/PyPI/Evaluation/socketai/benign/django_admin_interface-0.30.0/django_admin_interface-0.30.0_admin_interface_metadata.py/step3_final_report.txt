  "purpose": "Package metadata declaration for a Django admin interface extension.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments containing author, copyright, description, email, license, title, and version.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static metadata only.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string assignments defining package metadata. There are no functions, input/output operations, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The code is straightforward and typical for package initialization files. No anomalies, malicious behaviors, or security risks are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, static metadata module with no malicious or security concerns. The existing report correctly identifies its benign nature, and the scores are appropriate.",
