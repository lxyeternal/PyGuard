{
  "purpose": "Defines a class for function composition, allowing multiple callables to be combined into a single callable that applies them in sequence.",
  "sources": "Input arguments to the compose class constructor, and any calls to the resulting object.",
  "sinks": "The code executes user-provided callables; if these callables are malicious, they can perform harmful actions. There are no explicit sinks like network connections or file writes in this code itself.",
  "flows": "Input functions -> compose constructor -> stored in self.__wrapped__ and self._wrappers -> calling __call__ method -> sequential application of stored functions.",
  "anomalies": "The __call__ method has an unusual inner function __call__ that overwrites the __call__ method; this is unconventional but not malicious. The code does not perform any network activity, file access, or secret leakage. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function composition class, allowing chaining of callables. It validates that arguments are callables and supports nested composition. The __call__ method applies functions sequentially, but the implementation is straightforward and does not include any external or hidden malicious activity. There are no obfuscated segments, suspicious network activity, or data exfiltration code. The usage of __repr__ and __get__ methods are standard for such a utility. Overall, the code appears benign, focusing on functional composition without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a safe, utility-based function composition class with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply facilitates combining functions for easier functional programming. No indicators of malware or security vulnerabilities are present.",
