  "purpose": "Implement a Python class for function composition, allowing chaining and composition of multiple callables.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; only internal code and attributes.",
  "sinks": "Result of calling the composed function; potential to process untrusted input if user passes untrusted callables or arguments.",
  "flows": "Input arguments are passed through the composed functions sequentially; no external data flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. The code includes standard function composition logic and compatibility handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a compose class that enables combining multiple functions into a single callable. It validates that functions are callable, raises errors otherwise, and supports nested compositions. The __call__ method executes the functions in sequence, passing results along. The __repr__ method provides a string representation of the composition. No external data sources, network access, or system modifications are present. The code does not perform any malicious actions or data leaks. The only potential concern is that if untrusted functions are composed and called with untrusted input, the behavior could be unpredictable, but this is typical of function composition and not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a standard function composition class with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It appears to be a safe utility for chaining functions, with no external data access or harmful actions detected.",
