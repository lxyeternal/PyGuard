{
  "purpose": "The code implements a function composition utility class 'compose' allowing chaining of callables in a Pythonic way.",
  "sources": "No input sources or external data reads; internal functions are invoked with parameters provided at call time.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; no untrusted data processing or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Input arguments are passed to the composed function, which sequentially applies callables; no external data flows or network activities.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected. The code relies on standard Python features and clear exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'compose' class for function composition with proper input validation, method overrides for callability, and attribute management. No code injection, network access, or hidden behaviors are present. It correctly manages callable composition, supports method binding, and includes a version and license declaration. No signs of malicious intent or malicious side effects identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a function composition utility with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is well-structured, uses standard Python practices, and does not contain suspicious or malicious code.",
