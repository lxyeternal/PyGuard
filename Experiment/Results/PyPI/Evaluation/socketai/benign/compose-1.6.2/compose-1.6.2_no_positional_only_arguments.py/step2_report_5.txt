  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, potential vulnerabilities, and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** Benign utility for function composition; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent; no malware.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — justified, as no security risks are identified.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent. The scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility classes for function composition; no malicious code, but potential misuse if functions are malicious.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis; the code itself isn't malicious.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — very low, justified by the fact that user-provided functions could be malicious, but the utility code itself is benign.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The minimal security risk score reflects the potential danger if malicious functions are passed, but the utility code itself remains safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Function composition utility supporting sync and async; no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — slightly higher, possibly reflecting the potential for malicious use via user functions.\n\n**Assessment:** The score is reasonable. The code's design doesn't introduce vulnerabilities, but the potential for malicious functions exists, justifying a small risk score.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard utility for function composition; no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the benign nature of the code. The scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others; no malicious activity, supports sync and async composition.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — justified given the potential for malicious functions being composed.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning and scoring are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as the code is a benign utility for function composition.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly vary between 0 and 0.2, reflecting the potential danger if malicious functions are passed, but the utility code itself remains safe.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — considering the potential for misuse if user functions are malicious, but the utility code itself is safe.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a well-structured, benign utility module for function composition supporting both synchronous and asynchronous functions. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.",
