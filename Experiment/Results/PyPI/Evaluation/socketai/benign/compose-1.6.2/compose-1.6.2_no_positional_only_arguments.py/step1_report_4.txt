{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility classes for function composition, including synchronous and asynchronous variants, to facilitate chaining functions in a Pythonic manner.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or user inputs are read; the code mainly defines classes and functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed in a potentially harmful way, such as network calls, file writes, or command executions.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code does not process external untrusted data flows or inputs. It simply composes functions and manages their invocation order.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. The code structure is standard for function composition utilities, with no obfuscated elements or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script defines three classes: compose, acompose, and sacompose, which facilitate synchronous, asynchronous, and conditional asynchronous/synchronous function composition. The classes perform input validation (checking callables), extend existing functions, and handle awaitable objects properly. No external data or inputs are processed. No network operations, file manipulations, or system calls are present. The code appears to be a standard utility module for function composition, with well-defined behaviors and no signs of malicious activity or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for composing functions in Python, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous patterns. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, data exfiltration, or security risks within this code fragment. Its purpose is purely functional and safe.",
