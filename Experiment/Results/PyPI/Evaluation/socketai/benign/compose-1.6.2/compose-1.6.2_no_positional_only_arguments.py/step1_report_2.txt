{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility classes for composing synchronous and asynchronous functions, enabling flexible function chaining with support for awaitables.",
  "sources": "The code reads function arguments during initialization, and utilizes __call__, __repr__, and __get__ methods, mainly accessing functions passed as arguments.",
  "sinks": "The code executes user-provided functions via __call__ methods, which could be malicious if these functions are untrusted or malicious; however, no direct data leaks or malicious actions are evident within this code itself.",
  "flows": "Input functions → compose/acompose/sacompose instances initialized → calling the instance invokes __call__ → executes wrapped functions in sequence, possibly awaiting results → outputs final result.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code such as network calls, data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated logic is present. The code handles function composition cleanly and does not manipulate environment variables or system resources directly.",
  "analysis": "The module defines classes for composing functions synchronously and asynchronously, including support for nested composition. It performs argument validation, raising errors if invalid functions are provided. The __call__ methods execute the composed functions, handling awaitables where needed. The code appears straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or covert operations. It operates solely within function composition, which is a benign utility. No external data access, network calls, or security-sensitive operations are present. The presence of standard Python features and safe patterns indicates no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a utility library for function composition with support for async functions. It does not contain malware or malicious behaviors. The design is clean, with no suspicious or harmful code. The overall security risk is very low.",
