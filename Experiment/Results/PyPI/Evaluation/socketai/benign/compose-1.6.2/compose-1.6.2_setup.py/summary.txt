  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup script that uses filesystem manipulations to manage source files based on environment and version. No malware or obfuscation is present. The main security concern is environmental control over filesystem operations, which could be exploited but is not malicious in itself. The overall security risk is low to moderate."
