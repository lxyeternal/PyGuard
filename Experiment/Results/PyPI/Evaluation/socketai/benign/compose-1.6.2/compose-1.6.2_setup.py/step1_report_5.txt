{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for packaging a Python project named 'compose'. It determines which modules to include based on the build context and Python version, and manages symbolic links for source files during build.",
  "sources": "Reading the README file; checking sys.argv for build commands; accessing sys.version_info; accessing filesystem for file deletion and linking.",
  "sinks": "File deletion (os.unlink), symbolic linking (os.link or os.symlink), and reading files. No data from untrusted sources appears to influence security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "The script reads build commands and Python version info to select source files, then creates symbolic links for packaging, and reads README content for description.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.unlink to remove 'compose.py' (possibly a placeholder or a malicious attempt to overwrite files); symbolic linking of source files which could be misused to hide malicious files or interfere with build process; lack of validation or restrictions on linked files.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically links source files based on build parameters and Python version, which could be exploited if an attacker controls the linked files or the build environment. The unlink operation on 'compose.py' might remove existing files maliciously if misused. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious network activity detected. The linking operation could be misused to insert malicious files or alter the build process. Overall, the core operations are related to build setup, but the symbolic link creation and file removal are potentially exploitable actions if misused.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs standard setup tasks but includes symbolic linking of source files and deletion of existing files, which could be misused in a malicious context if an attacker gains control of the environment. There are no explicit malicious payloads, but the potential for abuse exists due to symbolic link manipulation.",
