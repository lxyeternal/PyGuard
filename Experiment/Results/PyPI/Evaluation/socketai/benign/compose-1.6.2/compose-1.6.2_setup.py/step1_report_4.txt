{
  "purpose": "This script sets up a Python package named 'compose', determining which modules to include based on the build context and Python version, and creating symbolic links or deleting files accordingly.",
  "sources": "Reads __doc__, __version__ from 'no_async'; reads 'README.rst' file; inspects sys.argv and sys.version_info; accesses and modifies filesystem (os.unlink, os.link, os.symlink); uses environment variables via sys.argv and sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "Creates symbolic links or deletes files based on runtime conditions; modifies filesystem structure during setup.",
  "flows": "Reads build arguments and Python version info (sources) -> determines modules and source files -> deletes or links files in filesystem (sinks) based on conditions.",
  "anomalies": "Uses symbolic link creation with fallback; deletes 'compose.py' during setup; conditional logic based on build arguments and Python version; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; no obfuscated code or suspicious function calls.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically manages setup files and modules depending on build context and Python version, using filesystem operations such as unlinking and linking files. No untrusted input is processed beyond build args and version info. No malicious code or backdoors are present. The symbolic link creation and file deletion are typical for setup scripts but should be used cautiously; however, they do not inherently indicate malicious intent. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or hidden backdoors were detected. The code appears to be a legitimate setup script with dynamic module selection and filesystem management.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions as a typical setup utility for a Python package, dynamically selecting modules and managing setup files. No malicious behavior or security risks were identified. The use of filesystem modifications is standard for build scripts but should be verified in context to ensure they do not interfere with system integrity. Overall, it appears benign and intentional.",
