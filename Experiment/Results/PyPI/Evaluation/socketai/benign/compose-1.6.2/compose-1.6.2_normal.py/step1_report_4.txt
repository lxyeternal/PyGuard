{
  "purpose": "Provide function composition utilities for synchronous, asynchronous, and sometimes-asynchronous callables.",
  "sources": "The code reads from input arguments passed to the composed functions, and the functions themselves when called.",
  "sinks": "The composed functions' results may be passed into other functions, potentially untrusted if sourced externally.",
  "flows": "Input arguments flow into the first callable (__wrapped__), then its output flows into subsequent callables in _wrappers, with asynchronous handling in accompose and sacompose.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Use of standard introspection and composition patterns without malicious behavior. The code relies on standard libraries and includes no network, file, or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code implements function composition classes supporting sync, async, and mixed callables. It uses introspection to determine if functions are coroutine or awaitable, and manages execution flow accordingly. The classes validate input callables, raising errors if none or invalid. The presence of the _finish helper function for async chaining appears standard for async control flow. There are no indications of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or system damage. The code avoids obfuscation and appears well-structured for its intended purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for function composition with support for async and sync functions. No malicious intent, suspicious activity, or security risks are evident. It performs safe, standard introspection and function chaining. Overall, the code is safe and intended for general use.",
