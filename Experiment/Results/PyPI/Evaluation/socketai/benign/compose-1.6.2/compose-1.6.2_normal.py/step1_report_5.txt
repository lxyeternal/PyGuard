{
  "purpose": "This code provides function composition utilities for synchronous and asynchronous functions, enabling chaining of callables with support for async behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external inputs or untrusted data; it only processes functions passed during initialization.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or potentially leaked; the code simply composes and calls functions.",
  "flows": "No external data sources flow into the functions; the flow is internal to function composition and invocation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code appears clean, with well-structured composition logic. The only minor note is the fallback definition of _markcoroutinefunction, which is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code implements function composition for both sync and async functions, with careful handling of awaitables. The logic for extending composed functions, checking for callability, and handling coroutine functions is standard. No suspicious behavior such as network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious code execution is present. The code does not handle external input data or perform any I/O operations that could be malicious. It appears to be a utility library designed for safe function chaining. The fallback definitions and attribute checks are benign compatibility measures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured utility for function composition with support for async operations. It shows no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe and appears to be a legitimate open-source utility library.",
