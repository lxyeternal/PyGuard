  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a function composition utility with no external data or malicious behavior.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** Standard implementation; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Fully aligns with the code's intent. Confidence 1, malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.1 (very low).\n\n**Assessment:** The code is a typical function composition utility, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on safe composition.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious patterns, standard use of 'inspect', no external interactions.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Clear and consistent. Confidence 1, malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Same as above; no malicious intent detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focuses on potential security risks, mainly the execution of user-provided functions.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** Recognizes that the code executes arbitrary functions, which could be malicious if supplied externally.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly notes that the code itself does not contain malicious code but highlights that executing untrusted functions can be risky. Confidence 0.95, malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The report accurately points out that the utility executes arbitrary functions, which could be malicious if misused, but the code itself is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous, emphasizing safe composition.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, standard introspection, no external I/O.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid assessment; no malicious activity. Confidence 1, malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** The code is a standard, safe utility for function composition.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Reiterates safe composition with no external data or malicious activity.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; benign compatibility code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Consistent with the code's nature. Confidence 1, malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The code is a safe, well-structured utility.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** The code matches the description; no anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All reports agree on malware = 0 and obfuscated = 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) due to the inherent risk in executing arbitrary user-provided functions, which could be malicious if misused. This is a reasonable, conservative estimate.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious code or payloads detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — clear, readable implementation.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — minimal risk associated with executing user-supplied functions; standard for such utilities.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, safe function composition utility with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The slight risk score reflects the potential danger if untrusted functions are executed, but this is inherent to any such utility and not a sign of malicious design.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1",
