{
  "purpose": "Provide function composition utilities, including synchronous, asynchronous, and sometimes-asynchronous composition of callables.",
  "sources": "The code reads the list of functions passed to constructors of compose, acompose, and sacompose, and processes them for composition.",
  "sinks": "The code calls functions with user-provided arguments and processes their return values, including awaiting if necessary.",
  "flows": "Input arguments -> constructors (__init__) -> call (__call__) -> optional awaiting (_finish) -> return result",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of inspect for function analysis is standard. No network, system modifications, or data exfiltration present. The code appears solely to provide function composition features.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for composing functions in synchronous and asynchronous contexts, handling nested compositions, and ensuring proper type checking and method binding. The code relies on standard Python features and inspect modules, with fallbacks for minimal Python versions. No malicious behavior or malicious code patterns detected. The functions perform safe composition without side effects or external interactions. The inclusion of try-except blocks and type checks indicates careful handling of diverse callable types but does not introduce any security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of function composition utilities for Python, including support for asynchronous functions. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code appears safe and intended for general use.",
