{
  "purpose": "The code implements function composition utilities, allowing users to create composed (synchronous and asynchronous) functions in a flexible way.",
  "sources": "Input functions provided during initialization of compose, acompose, or sacompose objects; function arguments during invocation.",
  "sinks": "Potentially executes the provided functions; no direct sinks such as network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input functions → composition objects → __call__ methods → execution of provided callables; no external or malicious flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. Use of dynamic function wrapping is standard for such utilities and appears legitimate. No obfuscated or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for composing functions synchronously and asynchronously, with support for bound methods and nested composition. It uses standard Python features such as inspect for introspection, supports coroutine detection, and provides property access to internal functions. The __call__ methods execute user-provided callables with proper handling of awaitables, ensuring correct behavior for async and sync functions. No malicious or suspicious patterns, such as network access, data exfiltration, or code injection, are present. The only noteworthy aspect is the careful handling of async behavior, which is legitimate for such utilities. No signs of obfuscation or malware are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of function composition utilities with robust handling of synchronous and asynchronous callables. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The design aligns with typical function composition libraries and does not perform any dangerous actions.",
