{
  "purpose": "Provides function composition utilities for synchronous, asynchronous, and hybrid callables, enabling chaining of functions with proper handling of awaitables.",
  "sources": "Input functions provided during initialization, which are then invoked during the call.",
  "sinks": "Execution of user-supplied functions; no external data, network, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input functions are called with provided arguments; results are passed through the composition chain, with awaitables handled appropriately.",
  "anomalies": "No secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected. Use of standard introspection and function validation.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard function composition patterns, validating callables, supporting nested compositions, and correctly handling async and sync functions. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. It performs safe, predictable operations without external system interactions or data leaks. The potential risk stems solely from executing arbitrary functions supplied at runtime, which is inherent to such utilities but not indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility for function composition with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score (~0.1) is appropriate, reflecting minimal inherent danger in executing user-provided functions. All reports' assessments and scores are consistent and justified.",
