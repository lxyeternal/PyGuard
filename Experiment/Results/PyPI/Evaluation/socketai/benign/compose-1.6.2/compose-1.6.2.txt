The minimal security risk is justified by the potential for misuse if untrusted functions are passed, but the code itself is safe. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.1 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup script that uses filesystem manipulations to manage source files based on environment and version. No malware or obfuscation is present. The main security concern is environmental control over filesystem operations, which could be exploited but is not malicious in itself. The overall security risk is low to moderate."

The minimal risk stems from executing user-provided callables, which is typical for such utilities. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."
