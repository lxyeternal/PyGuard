{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a standard Python module intended for general functionality, without any immediately obvious malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are not explicitly defined; the code does not read from external inputs such as files, network, or environment variables.",
  "sinks": "No sensitive sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system commands are present; no data leakage points are evident.",
  "flows": "There are no evident data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks, as the code primarily contains function definitions and simple logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated sections, or unusual code patterns. No backdoors or malicious code snippets are detected. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code includes standard Python constructs, with clear structure and no signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads. It lacks network activity, credential handling, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The absence of external inputs or suspicious operations indicates a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a safe, standard implementation with no signs of malware or security threats.",
