  "purpose": "This code is a comprehensive unittest suite for the 'cmakelint' Python package, testing parsing, error detection, and style rules for CMake configuration files.",
  "sources": "Internal string literals, function parameters, and mock objects; no external input or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data leaks, network activity, or system modifications; all operations are within controlled test environments.",
  "flows": "Internal data processing and validation functions; no external data flows or untrusted data execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code operates solely as a test suite, importing the main module for validation purposes. It uses mocks and controlled inputs, with no dynamic code execution or external interactions. The suppression of stderr and the structure follow standard testing practices. No signs of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured test suite for 'cmakelint' with no indicators of malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or security risks.",
