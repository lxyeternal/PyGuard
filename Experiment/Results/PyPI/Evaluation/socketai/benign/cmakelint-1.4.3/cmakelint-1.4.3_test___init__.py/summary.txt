  "conclusion": "Most reports correctly identify benign code with low risk. Report 4 indicates notable suspicious activity, warranting a higher malware score (~0.5). Report 5's behaviors suggest moderate suspicion; increasing malware to ~0.5 and obfuscation to ~0.4 improves accuracy. Overall, the security risk remains moderate (~0.4-0.5). The scores should be adjusted to better reflect the observed behaviors, especially in report 4, to ensure accurate risk assessment."
