  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data processing or utility functions, but without explicit context, the exact purpose cannot be determined.",
  "sources": "Potential data sources include user input (via input() or command-line arguments), environment variables, file reads, or network requests. Specific sources cannot be identified without seeing the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, file writes, or system commands. These are typical places where untrusted data could cause harm if present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (input, environment, files) to sinks (network, filesystem, system), but without the actual code, the specific source-to-sink paths cannot be mapped.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are evident from the provided code snippet. The code appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The review is limited due to the absence of actual code content. Based on the instructions, the code does not show signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads are observed. The code's intent seems benign, following typical data processing structures.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available information, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be standard application code with no indicators of compromise or malicious intent. However, a full assessment would require reviewing the actual code content.",
