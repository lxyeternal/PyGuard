  "purpose": "This code serves as a testing harness for executing a command-line linter ('cmakelint.py') on project files, verifying the output against expected results in a controlled environment.",
  "sources": "Reads input from sample files and command-line arguments, constructs command strings for subprocess execution.",
  "sinks": "Uses subprocess.Popen with 'shell=True' to execute constructed command strings.",
  "flows": "Input data from sample files and args flow into command strings, which are executed via subprocess, with output captured for verification.",
  "anomalies": "Constructs command strings via string concatenation with 'shell=True' without sanitization; potential command injection if inputs are malicious, but inputs are controlled in testing context.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard testing utility that executes commands with controlled inputs. It employs 'shell=True' but only with predefined, trusted data, minimizing risk. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The main concern is the use of 'shell=True', which could be risky if inputs were untrusted, but in this context, it is acceptable. The code's purpose is solely testing, with no evidence of malicious intent or activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, controlled testing framework with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The use of 'shell=True' with controlled inputs does not constitute a security threat here. Malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2 due to the subprocess call pattern, which is acceptable in this context.",
