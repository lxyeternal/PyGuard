  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, controlled testing framework with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The use of 'shell=True' with controlled inputs does not constitute a security threat here. Malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2 due to the subprocess call pattern, which is acceptable in this context."
