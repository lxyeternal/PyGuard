  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The script is a test harness executing a command-line tool ('cmakelint.py') on sample files, verifying output against expected results. It uses subprocess with controlled inputs, no malicious intent detected.\n- **Risks:** No malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. Use of 'shell=True' is acceptable here due to controlled inputs.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0, confidence = 1.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing controlled execution of 'cmakelint.py' with test data files. The main concern is the use of subprocess with 'shell=True' and string concatenation, which could be risky if inputs are untrusted.\n- **Risks:** No actual malicious activity, but potential command injection if inputs are compromised.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1 (due to 'shell=True' and concatenation), confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the potential command injection risk from unvalidated inputs concatenated into command strings with 'shell=True'. No evidence of malicious payloads.\n- **Risks:** Slightly higher security concern due to command construction method.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2, confidence = 0.8.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with emphasis on controlled environment and standard testing practices. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Risks:** Use of 'shell=True' is noted but acceptable given controlled inputs.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0, confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Reinforces that the code is a testing framework with no signs of malicious activity. The only concern is 'shell=True' with unvalidated inputs, but in this context, it's safe.\n- **Risks:** Minimal, no malware.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2, confidence = 0.9.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None detected. The code is a testing harness.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors.\n- **Malware risk:** None. The code executes external commands in a controlled testing environment.\n- **Security risk:** Slight concern due to 'shell=True' and string concatenation, but only in the context of controlled test data, not user input.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (due to use of 'shell=True' with string concatenation, which is a common risk in command execution, but acceptable here because of controlled inputs)\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard, controlled testing framework for a command-line tool, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The minor security concern regarding subprocess usage is typical in test harnesses and does not indicate malicious activity.\n\n**Final estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like further detailed reasoning or specific score justifications.",
