  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Standard setup script for a Python package (`cmakelint`)\n- Reads `README.md` for long description\n- Dynamically imports version info from `cmakelint.__version__` via `importlib.import_module`\n- Reads dependency files (`test-requirements`, `dev-requirements`) with a function that filters out comments and empty lines\n- No external network calls, no data exfiltration, no command execution based on untrusted input\n- Uses standard practices; no obfuscation or malicious code detected\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1 & 2:**\n- Both identify the script as a standard setup script\n- No suspicious code, no untrusted data sinks, no anomalies\n- Confident in the safety (confidence 1)\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks\n- Correctly conclude the script is safe\n\n**Assessment:** These are accurate and consistent with the code. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Notes the use of `importlib.import_module('cmakelint.__version__')` as a potential concern\n- Recognizes that this could be exploited if the module is maliciously replaced, but states this is standard practice\n- Slight concern about the integrity of the version module, but overall sees no malicious intent\n- Assigns a security risk of 0.2, which is cautious but reasonable\n\n**Justification:** The dynamic import could be a vector if the module is compromised, but in typical package development, this is acceptable. No actual malicious behavior is present.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No need to increase the malware score; the risk score is appropriately low.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 & 5:**\n- Similar to others, recognize the script as standard\n- Point out that dynamic import could be exploited if the module is tampered with\n- No evidence of malicious code or obfuscation\n- Assign a security risk of around 0.1-0.2, which seems appropriate\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None. The code is a typical setup script.\n- **Obfuscation:** No, the code is straightforward.\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, with minor concern about dynamic import, but this is standard practice.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Keep at 0.0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk score:** Given the dynamic import, a slight increase to 0.1 or 0.2 is reasonable, but overall, the risk remains minimal.\n\n### **My final estimate:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|------------|--------------|--------|\n| **0.0**    | **0.0**      | **0.1** |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, safe setup script with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain risks. The only minor concern is the dynamic import of the version module, which is a common pattern but should be maintained with integrity checks in production environments.",
