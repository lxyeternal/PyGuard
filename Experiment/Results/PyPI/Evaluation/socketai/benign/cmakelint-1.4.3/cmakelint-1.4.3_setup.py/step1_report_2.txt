  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the cmakelint package, including version retrieval, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "importlib.import_module('cmakelint.__version__'), open('README.md')",
  "sinks": "None identified; no direct data leakage or unsafe operations detected",
  "flows": "Version is obtained via importlib from 'cmakelint.__version__'; README content is read directly from file",
  "anomalies": "The code attempts to import the version module; no apparent anomalies. The use of open() for README file is standard.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup operations: importing modules, reading files, and configuring package metadata. The get_version() function dynamically imports the version module. read_without_comments() reads dependency files while filtering comments. No external network connections, no handling of untrusted input, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It uses standard Python packaging practices without any suspicious behavior.",
