{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'cmakelint' Python package, used to configure package metadata, dependencies, and entry points for installation.",
  "sources": "The script reads the 'README.md' file, and dynamically imports 'cmakelint.__version__' module to get the version; also reads requirement files 'test-requirements' and 'dev-requirements'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data is written to external systems, no network connections, or command executions based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Input reading occurs from local files ('README.md', requirement files). No data flows from untrusted sources to critical functions; version retrieval imports internal module. The setup configuration does not process external input at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; the import and file reading methods are standard. The use of importlib for version retrieval is typical, but the 'ver_file' variable is unused, which is harmless but unnecessary. No obfuscated or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs package setup using setuptools, with standard metadata and configuration. It reads requirement files and the README for description, and dynamically imports the version. No external data input or untrusted sources are processed at runtime. The code structure is typical for a setup script, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It only reads local files and imports internal modules without executing untrusted code or performing harmful actions.",
