  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the 'cmakelint' package, including version retrieval and dependencies.",
  "sources": "importlib (for version import), open() (for reading files), package metadata fields",
  "sinks": "open() for reading files (long_description), importlib.import_module() for dynamic import",
  "flows": "Reading version via importlib → reading README.md for long_description",
  "anomalies": "Use of importlib to dynamically import a module for version; reading files directly without validation; no use of user input or untrusted data sources.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup tasks for a Python package. It dynamically imports the version module, reads local files for dependencies and descriptions, and defines package metadata. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors such as network access, code execution, or data exfiltration. The use of importlib is standard for dynamic version retrieval. File reading is straightforward without external inputs. The code does not contain obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears legitimate and secure. It performs expected package configuration tasks without any signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
