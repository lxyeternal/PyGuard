{
  "purpose": "This script is designed to set up and configure a Python package called 'cmakelint', including reading version information, dependencies, and package metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads files ('test-requirements', 'dev-requirements', 'README.md') and imports a module ('cmakelint.__version__') to retrieve version info.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include reading external files and importing modules. The 'importlib.import_module' could execute arbitrary code if the module is maliciously altered. The 'open' function reads files, including the long description from 'README.md'.",
  "flows": "Sources like 'importlib.import_module' and 'open' feed data into the setup configuration. No untrusted data flows into critical sensitive functions or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are detected. The code appears straightforward and typical for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script performs package setup operations: reading version info from a module, reading requirements from files, and configuring package metadata. The use of 'importlib' to dynamically import the version module could be exploited if the module is maliciously replaced. However, this is standard practice and not inherently malicious. The 'read_without_comments' function filters out comments and empty lines from requirement files, which is safe. There are no network connections, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code present. The overall structure is standard for a Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The only minor concern is the dynamic import of the version module, which assumes the integrity of the package contents. Overall, it appears safe.",
