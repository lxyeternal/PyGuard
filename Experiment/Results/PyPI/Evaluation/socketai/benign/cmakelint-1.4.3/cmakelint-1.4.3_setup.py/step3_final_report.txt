{
  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging the cmakelint project, including reading version info and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md', 'test-requirements', 'dev-requirements', and dynamically imports 'cmakelint.__version__' module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external network or command execution; reads local files and imports internal modules.",
  "flows": "Reads local files for description and dependencies; imports version module via importlib; no external data flow or command execution.",
  "anomalies": "Unused variable 'ver_file' is harmless; standard practices used; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py with safe, straightforward code. The dynamic import of the version module could be exploited if the module is maliciously replaced, but this is a common pattern in packaging. No network activity, code injection, or suspicious behavior present. The code is clear, well-structured, and does not contain obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard setup script with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The minor concern about dynamic import is acknowledged but does not constitute malicious behavior. Overall, the supply chain security risk is very low.",
