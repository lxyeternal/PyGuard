{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package named 'cmakelint', including configuration for version retrieval, dependencies, and entry points for command-line usage.",
  "sources": "Reading the version from an import statement, reading requirements files ('test-requirements', 'dev-requirements'), reading 'README.md' for long description, and package metadata.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of code from 'README.md' (via open and read), import of 'cmakelint.__version__', and reading of requirement files.",
  "flows": "Importing 'cmakelint.__version__' (source) to 'get_version()' function return; reading requirement files (source) to 'test_required' and 'dev-requirements' (sinks); reading README.md (source) to long_description (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'importlib.import_module' to dynamically import version info could be exploited if the module is tampered with; reading files directly without validation is typical but should be safe here; no use of eval, exec, or other risky constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs package setup, including importing version info, reading requirements, and configuring package metadata. The only dynamic code execution occurs when importing 'cmakelint.__version__', which relies on the module's content. The code reads files such as 'README.md' and requirement files without executing their content. No hardcoded secrets, network operations, or malicious patterns are present. The code appears standard for a setup script with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It properly reads version info and requirements files for package configuration. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks are detected.",
