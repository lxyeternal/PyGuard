  "purpose": "A static code analysis tool (linter) for CMake files, performing style checks, syntax validation, and best practice enforcement.",
  "sources": "Reads CMake files, configuration files, environment variables, and command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Outputs error messages to stderr; no untrusted data flows into external systems or network.",
  "flows": "Reads files and configs, processes lines with regex, reports errors based on style and syntax rules.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, malicious code, or network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured static analysis tool that performs file I/O, regex-based style checks, and error reporting. It does not execute external commands, connect to networks, or handle sensitive data maliciously. The regex patterns and file handling are standard for linters, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with its benign, static nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, open-source static analysis tool for CMake files, with no malicious intent or behavior. The security risk is negligible, and the scores assigned are justified.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
