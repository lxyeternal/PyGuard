{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a linter for CMake files, checking style, syntax, and best practices according to specified rules.",
  "sources": "Reads input files (CMakeLists.txt, .cmake files), command-line arguments, environment variables (XDG_CONFIG_DIR), and file content for inline pragmas.",
  "sinks": "Prints error messages to standard output; reads configuration files; accesses environment variables; opens and reads files from disk.",
  "flows": "Reads file data from disk -> processes line-by-line -> outputs errors based on rule violations; reads configuration from environment variables or files -> sets internal state accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious file operations. No dynamic code execution, network connections, or obfuscated code detected. The code performs standard linting tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static code analysis tool specifically for CMake files, with functions to parse files, manage configuration and filters, check code style, and output errors. It handles file I/O, environment variables, and command-line options safely without executing external or untrusted code. No indicators of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, reverse shells, or backdoors are present. It only processes static files and outputs error messages accordingly.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign static analysis tool intended for style and syntax checking of CMake files. It does not contain malicious code, sabotage, or malware. Its security risk score is very low, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
