{
  "purpose": "This code is a static code analysis tool (linter) for CMake files, designed to enforce style and consistency rules in CMake scripts.",
  "sources": "Reads input files specified via command-line arguments; reads configuration files; processes lines of code within files.",
  "sinks": "Outputs error messages to standard error; reads configuration files; accesses environment variables (e.g., XDG_CONFIG_DIR); opens files from filesystem.",
  "flows": "Reads files line-by-line; processes lines to identify commands, comments, and style issues; outputs errors based on checks; can load configuration from files or environment variables.",
  "anomalies": "Uses standard library functions safely; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; no dynamic code execution or network activity detected; the code primarily performs static analysis and file handling with no suspicious or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The script performs static analysis of CMake files, focusing on style enforcement and consistency. It reads files, processes lines to identify command patterns, comments, and indentation issues, and outputs error messages for violations. Configuration files and command-line options influence its behavior. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, command injection, network communication, or backdoors. All operations are confined to file reading, text processing, and standard error output, with no runtime code execution, external network connections, or credential handling. The code maintains a benign purpose throughout, with no anomalies indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static analysis tool with no evidence of malware or malicious behavior. It is designed to help enforce coding standards for CMake files and does not perform any harmful actions. The overall security risk is negligible.",
