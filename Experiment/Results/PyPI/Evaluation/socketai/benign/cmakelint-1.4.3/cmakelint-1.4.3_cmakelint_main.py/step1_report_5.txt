{
  "purpose": "The code is a static analysis tool (linter) for CMake files, designed to check style, syntax, and consistency issues in CMake scripts.",
  "sources": "Reads input files specified via command line arguments or default 'CMakeLists.txt'; reads configuration from files or environment variables; processes lines within files.",
  "sinks": "Outputs error and warning messages to stdout/stderr; processes configuration files; may read environment variables for config paths.",
  "flows": "Sources include file reads and environment variables; flow leads to error reporting functions and configuration setting functions; no data flows directly to network or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are present. The code primarily performs file I/O, regex parsing, and command-line argument handling. No obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a static code analysis tool that processes CMake files, applies style and syntax checks, and reports issues via console output. It reads configuration settings, command-line options, and files for analysis. No code suggests malicious intent such as data exfiltration, system modification, or network activity. It does use regex extensively for parsing, but these are for legitimate syntax checks. There are no functions or code blocks that perform network operations, system modifications, or hidden behaviors. The code structure is typical for a linter tool, with no signs of malware or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate static analysis tool for CMake scripts with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs file parsing, style checking, and error reporting without executing untrusted code, accessing sensitive data, or performing harmful actions.",
