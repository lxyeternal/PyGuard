{
  "purpose": "This code defines a series of error code constants and messages for a Tencent Cloud service, likely used for internal error handling and user feedback.",
  "sources": "The code reads from static variable definitions assigned string values representing error codes and messages.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, user input, or external data sources are processed or outputted; this code merely defines constants.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or data handling processes involving untrusted input or external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward, structured, and contains only constant definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises static string assignments representing error codes and messages, with no logic, data processing, or external interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code appears to be part of an SDK or API client library, serving as a repository of error identifiers. It does not perform any network operations, handle sensitive data, or execute dynamic code. No signs of obfuscation, malware, or security risks are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard collection of error code constants used for application logic, with no malicious intent or security concerns. It serves as a static reference for error handling within a larger system.",
