  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Nature**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of static string constants defining error codes and messages.\n   - There are no functions, input/output operations, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - The code is a typical error code enumeration used in SDKs or APIs for standardized error handling.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Obfuscation**:\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious constructs are evident.\n   - The code does not process or handle external data, nor does it contain any network activity, secrets, or backdoors.\n   - The reports uniformly conclude benign intent, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes**:\n   - No logical errors or flaws are apparent.\n   - The code is straightforward and well-structured for its purpose.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign a score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward static constants.\n   - **Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, which is reasonable since there's no vulnerability or malicious activity.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - No claims are made about vulnerabilities or potential exploits; all assessments are accurate.\n\n6. **Consistency & Reasonableness**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - The confidence level is 1, reflecting high certainty of benign nature.\n\n**Final Assessment & Recommendations**:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk or vulnerabilities)\n\n**Overall Conclusion**:\nThis is a standard, benign constants definition file for error handling in an SDK or API client. No security concerns, malware, or obfuscation are present. The reports are accurate and align with the code's purpose.\n\n**Note**: Always ensure that such static files are not tampered with in supply chain scenarios. If this code was introduced via a dependency, verify the integrity of the package source. However, based solely on the code provided, there are no security issues.",
