  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a static collection of error code constants.\n- No dynamic data processing, input handling, or external communication is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.\n- The code is typical for SDKs or API client libraries, serving as error code definitions.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code contains only string assignments for error identifiers and messages.\n- There are no functions, logic, or data flows.\n- No secrets, credentials, or sensitive data are embedded.\n- The structure and content are straightforward and standard.\n\n**Malware and obfuscation assessment:**\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0.\n- Given the code's simplicity and static nature, this is appropriate.\n- No suspicious patterns or hidden behaviors are present.\n\n**Risk scoring:**\n- The overall security risk is negligible; the code is benign.\n- The purpose is purely for error reporting, a common practice in SDKs.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is safe, with no security concerns.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are justified.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final note:**\nThis code is a standard, benign constants module with no security issues.",
