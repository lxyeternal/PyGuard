  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports confirm that the code is a static collection of string constants defining error codes and messages.\n- No input processing, data flow, network activity, or dynamic logic is present.\n- No obfuscation, hidden behavior, or malicious code is identified.\n- The code appears to be part of an SDK or API client, serving as a reference for error handling.\n\n**Security Implications:**\n- Since the code is purely declarative with no runtime logic, it cannot be malicious or pose security risks.\n- The absence of data handling, network communication, or executable logic indicates a very low security concern.\n- No signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscation are present.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 for all reports. No evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0. All reports agree the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code, a score of 0.0 is appropriate. No security risk is associated with static constant definitions.\n\n**Potential Discrepancies or Assumptions:**\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is based solely on static content.\n\n**Final Summary:**\n- The code is a benign, standard set of error code constants.\n- No security concerns, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n- The scores should remain at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analyses provided.",
