{
  "purpose": "This code defines a series of constants representing error codes and messages related to a Tencent Cloud service, primarily for error handling and reporting in API responses.",
  "sources": "The code contains static string assignments for error code identifiers and messages; it does not read input or data at runtime.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; the code does not perform I/O, network communication, or data handling.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code is purely declarative, defining constants for error codes.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and contains no unusual code, obfuscated parts, or hidden behavior. It is a standard approach to error code definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of constant string assignments for error codes and messages, with licensing comments at the top. No logic, input processing, or external interactions are present. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The structure and content suggest typical SDK or API client error definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard error code definition module with no malicious intent, no obfuscated code, and no security risks. It is a normal part of API or SDK error handling. No security concerns are present.",
