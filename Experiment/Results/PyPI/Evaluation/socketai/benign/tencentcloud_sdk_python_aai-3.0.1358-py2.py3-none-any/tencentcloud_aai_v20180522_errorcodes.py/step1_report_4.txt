{
  "purpose": "The code defines a set of constant error codes and messages related to a Tencent Cloud service, likely for use in a client SDK or API error handling.",
  "sources": "Constants are hardcoded as string variables at the top of the file, representing various error codes and messages.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include data processing, input/output operations, or untrusted data handling that could lead to security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or data processing routines; the file solely contains static constant definitions.",
  "anomalies": "The file contains only static constant definitions with no executable logic, input handling, or data manipulation. No secrets, credentials, or dynamic code are present. No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The file appears to be a straightforward enumeration of error codes and messages, commonly used for standardized error reporting in API responses. It does not process or handle untrusted data, nor does it contain code that could be exploited or used maliciously. The presence of only constant definitions suggests it is a part of a larger SDK or API framework. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, data exfiltration, or other security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a static set of error code constants for error handling within a Tencent Cloud SDK or API. It does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. It is benign and purely informational.",
