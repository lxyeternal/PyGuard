  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's nature, the scoring, and the security implications.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a static set of constant string definitions representing error codes and messages.\n- There is no logic, data processing, input/output, or dynamic behavior.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or hidden behavior.\n- The code appears to be part of an SDK or API client, serving as a reference for error handling.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of malicious behavior:**  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code contains only static constants with no executable logic. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n\n2. **Obfuscation and security risks:**  \n   The obfuscated score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the absence of obfuscation.\n\n3. **Malware score:**  \n   The malware score is 0 in all reports, which aligns with the analysis that there is no malicious intent or behavior.\n\n4. **Risk score justification:**  \n   The risk scores are all 0.5 or below, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code. Since the code is purely declarative, the risk is minimal.\n\n5. **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports correctly avoid assumptions about vulnerabilities, as the code is static and does not process external data.\n\n6. **Consistency of scores:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's nature.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code is a benign, static collection of error code constants.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements are present.\n- The scoring in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) is justified and appropriate.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (to reflect the minimal inherent risk of static code, but practically negligible)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis code is entirely benign, with no security concerns. The scores should remain at zero for malware and obfuscation, with a very low risk score (around 0.1) to acknowledge that static constant definitions generally pose minimal risk.\n\n---\n\n**Overall, I agree with the reports' assessments.** They correctly identify that this is a standard, non-malicious constants file with no obfuscation or security risks.",
