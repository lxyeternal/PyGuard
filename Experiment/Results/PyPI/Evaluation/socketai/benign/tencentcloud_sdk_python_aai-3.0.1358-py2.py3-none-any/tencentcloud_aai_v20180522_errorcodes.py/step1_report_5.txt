{
  "purpose": "This code defines a series of constant error codes and messages for an API, likely related to Tencent Cloud services, to be used for error handling and reporting.",
  "sources": "The code is a list of constant variable assignments containing error code strings, which are set as values for specific error types.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data inputs or outputs; the code only contains static string definitions, with no data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow or data processing occurs; the code solely initializes constant error message variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is straightforward constant definitions. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hidden behaviors, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static variable declarations for error codes and messages, typical for SDKs or API error handling. There is no dynamic execution, data input, or output processing. No suspicious patterns, hidden code, or malicious logic are evident. The code is well-structured and adheres to standard practices for defining constants.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely a set of constant error definitions for an API, with no malicious intent, no data flow, and no suspicious behavior. It appears to be a benign component used for consistent error reporting.",
