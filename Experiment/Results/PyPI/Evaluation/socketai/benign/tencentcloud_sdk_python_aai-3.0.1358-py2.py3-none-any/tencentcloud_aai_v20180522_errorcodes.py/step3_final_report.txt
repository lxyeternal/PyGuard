{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of string constants representing error codes and messages used in an SDK or API for error handling and reporting.",
  "sources": "The code itself is static; it does not read input or data from external sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; the code only declares constants.",
  "flows": "No data flows or data processing occur within this code segment; it solely provides static mappings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns are present; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static collection of string constants for error codes and messages, with no logic, data handling, or external interactions. It does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The absence of dynamic code, secrets, or network activity indicates a benign purpose. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, static constants file used for error handling in an SDK or API. It poses no security risks, contains no malware or obfuscation, and is safe for supply chain use.",
