{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of string constants representing error codes and messages related to Tencent Cloud services, particularly for speech recognition and related functionalities.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the static definitions of error code constants; no external data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data flows to affect system behavior or leak information, as the code only contains constant string assignments.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks since this is a static constants definition with no dynamic data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a straightforward set of constant definitions, with no obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious constructs. There are no hardcoded secrets or credentials.",
  "analysis": "The script is a collection of predefined string constants for error codes and messages used in Tencent Cloud SDKs or services. It does not process or handle external input, nor does it execute any logic beyond variable assignment. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code serves as a static reference for error handling, which is standard practice in SDK development.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and serves as a set of error message constants for Tencent Cloud services. There are no indicators of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It is a typical configuration or constants file with no security concerns.",
