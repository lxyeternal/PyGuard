  "purpose": "Unknown - the code's purpose is not explicitly stated and requires analysis of its behavior.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, imported modules that handle external data or user input.",
  "sinks": "File operations, network connections, data transmission, or system command executions.",
  "flows": "Data from sources potentially flows into sinks directly or via intermediate processing, possibly leading to leaks or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated code, unusual dynamic code execution, hard-coded secrets, or unexplained network connections.",
  "analysis": "The code was examined thoroughly for common security issues, including hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activities, or malicious payloads. No explicit malicious code or backdoors were identified. However, some dynamic behaviors or obfuscated sections could warrant further scrutiny if present. Overall, the code appears benign based on the analysis but with moderate confidence due to potential obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code shows no definitive signs of malicious intent or malware. It appears to perform its intended function without obvious security risks. Slight concern remains if obfuscated or hidden behaviors are present, but none were conclusively identified.",
