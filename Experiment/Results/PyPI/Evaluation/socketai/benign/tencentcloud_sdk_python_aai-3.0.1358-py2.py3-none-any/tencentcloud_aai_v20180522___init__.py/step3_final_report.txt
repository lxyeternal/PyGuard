  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code reading input data, environment variables, network connections, dynamic code execution (eval/exec).",
  "sinks": "Network transmission, file system modifications, environment variable access, potential data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input sources (e.g., eval/exec, network) leading to actions like data exfiltration, system modification, or backdoors.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation (Report 2), use of eval/exec, hardcoded suspicious URLs or credentials, incomplete or missing code (Report 5).",
  "analysis": "Report 1 describes straightforward, benign code with no suspicious patterns; malware and obfuscation scores are zero, risk low, confidence high. Report 2 indicates obfuscation and dynamic code execution, justified by high obfuscated (0.8) and malware (0.65) scores, with a higher security risk (0.6). Reports 3 and 4 are benign, with no obfuscation or malicious activity, scores consistent with low threat levels. Report 5 lacks code, justifying minimal scores and low confidence. Overall, the scores align with the described code features, with Report 2 justifying higher suspicion due to obfuscation and eval/exec usage.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign; only Report 2 shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, warranting higher malware and risk scores. The overall assessment indicates low threat, with moderate suspicion in Report 2. Scores are consistent with the evidence, and no adjustments are necessary.",
