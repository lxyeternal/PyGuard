  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign; only Report 2 shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, warranting higher malware and risk scores. The overall assessment indicates low threat, with moderate suspicion in Report 2. Scores are consistent with the evidence, and no adjustments are necessary."
