{
  "purpose": "Define data structures for various speech and chat API requests and responses.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from parameters passed to class instances, typically from external API calls or client inputs.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data can flow into properties like Text, User, Data, and language/format parameters that may be used in processing or external calls.",
  "flows": "External input (params) -> class properties -> internal logic or serialization/deserialization methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code segments. No unusual code patterns or obfuscation. Use of warnings for extra parameters may suggest flexible input handling but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of data model classes inheriting from AbstractModel, mainly for serializing/deserializing request and response data structures for speech recognition, translation, and chat services. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or system modifications are present. The use of warning for unused parameters is standard and not suspicious. The code appears clean and typical for SDK data models, with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard SDK data model implementation with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It primarily manages data flow within API requests and responses, with no external network or system impact.",
