{
  "purpose": "Defines data models for Tencent Cloud speech and chat API requests and responses, serving as SDK data transfer objects.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in class constructors and deserialization methods, such as 'Text', 'Url', 'Data', etc.",
  "sinks": "No dangerous sinks; data is assigned to class attributes without external system calls or network operations.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from deserialization into class attributes; no external or untrusted data is processed in a malicious manner.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected; use of warnings for unused fields is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of data model classes with properties, setters, and deserialization methods. There are no network calls, code execution, or obfuscated segments. The structure is typical for SDK request/response models. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with this benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate SDK data models for Tencent Cloud APIs, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The supply chain security risk is negligible.",
