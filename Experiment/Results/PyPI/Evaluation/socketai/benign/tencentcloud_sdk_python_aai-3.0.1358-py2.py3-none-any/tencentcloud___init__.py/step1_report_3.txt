  "purpose": "The code appears to define metadata for a Python package, specifically setting version information and licensing details.",
  "sources": "The source of data is the file header comments and the __version__ variable declaration.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or places where untrusted data is processed or can lead to data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is present in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only metadata and license comments, with no executable logic, input handling, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of license comments and a version variable assignment. No executable code, input handling, or external data interactions are present. The licensing information is standard and does not indicate malicious intent. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues. The absence of code logic suggests it is a non-malicious metadata snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a harmless header containing licensing and version info for a package. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks.",
