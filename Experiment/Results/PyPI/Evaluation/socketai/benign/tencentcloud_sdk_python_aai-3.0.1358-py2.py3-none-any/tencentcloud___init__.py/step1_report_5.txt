  "purpose": "The code appears to set metadata for a Python package, including licensing and version information.",
  "sources": "The source is the file header comments and the __version__ variable assignment.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data processing are present in this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs; only licensing comments and a version variable.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing information and a version string assignment, which are common in open-source project files. No user input, network activity, or sensitive data handling is observed. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. The comments and version assignment are standard and do not suggest obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is benign, serving as metadata for a Python package with no indication of malicious activity or security issues.",
