  "purpose": "The code appears to be a licensing and version header, likely for a larger software module or package, specifying licensing terms and version information.",
  "sources": "The code sources include comments and metadata such as copyright notices, licensing information, and version assignment.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit data sinks or untrusted data handling in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink is present, as this is purely metadata and licensing information.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code contains only comments and a simple version assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of license comments, copyright notices, and a version string assignment. It does not contain any executable logic, input/output handling, or data processing. No indicators of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation are evident. It appears to be a standard license header for a Python file, likely part of a larger codebase.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a benign license header and version declaration with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It is a typical component of open-source or licensed software projects.",
