  "purpose": "The code appears to set metadata for a Python package or module, specifically defining the version number and including licensing information.",
  "sources": "The sources include the license comments at the beginning and the __version__ variable assignment.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows where untrusted input could cause security issues.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or source-to-sink paths present.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only comments and a version assignment; no unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The file primarily contains licensing comments and a version string. It does not perform any operations, data handling, or execution logic. The presence of licensing comments and versioning is standard for open-source packages and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving only as metadata for a package. No malicious behavior, anomalies, or security risks are detected.",
