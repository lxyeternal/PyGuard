  "purpose": "This code serves as a license header and version identifier for a software package, providing metadata rather than executable logic.",
  "sources": "Comments containing licensing information and a version string assignment",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or input handling present",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code does not process or transfer data",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of comments and a variable assignment",
  "analysis": "The code contains only licensing comments and a version variable, with no executable statements, data flows, or input/output operations. It is a standard metadata snippet used in open-source projects. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign and metadata-only nature of the code. The confidence levels are high, given the straightforward content. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely metadata with no malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with appropriate scoring. No further action or modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
