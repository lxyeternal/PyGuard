  "purpose": "AWS Athena client wrapper managing sessions, credentials, MFA, and query cursors for secure data querying.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input prompts for MFA, AWS SDK calls for credentials and session management.",
  "sinks": "AWS SDK interactions, environment variables, user input for MFA codes.",
  "flows": "Credential retrieval via environment variables or user input → AWS SDK calls for session tokens or role assumption → MFA input prompts → Session and client creation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of input() for MFA codes, which could be exploited in social engineering or automated environments, but is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard AWS Athena client with session management, role assumption, MFA prompts, and credential handling. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. MFA prompts via input() are typical but could be misused if environment is compromised. The resource management methods are stubbed but not malicious. The security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate, reflecting minimal inherent risks associated with MFA prompts and credential handling. The malware score is 0, as no malicious code or payloads are detected. The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is clear and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard AWS Athena client implementation with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The MFA prompts are standard for secure credential workflows. The overall security posture is low risk, with scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.",
