{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes for handling and parsing Athena query execution responses and metadata, primarily for monitoring, logging, or data analysis purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from response dictionaries passed to class constructors, which may originate from external sources such as API responses or data files.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write untrusted data to external systems or execute external commands. It mainly stores and exposes data via properties without any apparent data leak or injection points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from response dictionaries into class instances (source), and properties provide access to this data without executing or modifying it.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses regex patterns for string parsing and contains constants and property methods; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic are evident. The code is structured and documented normally without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of data model classes that parse and encapsulate response data from Athena service responses. There are no external commands, network calls, or data manipulations that could indicate malicious activity. The use of response.get() and property methods are standard. No obfuscation, suspicious code patterns, or dynamic execution is present. The code's purpose appears solely to organize and access response data.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign and intended for data handling and modeling of Athena query and metadata responses. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident, and there are no signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks. The overall security risk is low.",
