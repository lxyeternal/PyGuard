{
  "purpose": "This code provides data models and utility classes for handling Athena query execution and metadata responses from AWS, including status tracking and schema information.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from response dictionaries, typically obtained from AWS Athena API responses.",
  "sinks": "Data flows into class attributes; no sink points perform unsafe operations or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Response data is read from dictionaries and stored into class attributes; no untrusted data flows into external systems or network calls.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or suspicious data handling present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward data model implementation with no dynamic code execution, no external system interactions, and no suspicious patterns. It strictly processes input response data from AWS Athena API, extracting various metadata and status information. All data handling is confined to attribute assignments and property accessors. There are no signs of malware, credential theft, or malicious behavior. The code is well-structured, with no obfuscation or malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, focused on modeling and extracting metadata from AWS Athena responses. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
