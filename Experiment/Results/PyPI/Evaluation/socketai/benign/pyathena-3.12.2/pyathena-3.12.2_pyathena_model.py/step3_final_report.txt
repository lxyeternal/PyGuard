{
  "purpose": "The code defines data models and response parsers for AWS Athena API responses, encapsulating query execution details, statuses, metadata, and related entities.",
  "sources": "Response dictionaries from Athena API calls, accessed via get() methods for various keys.",
  "sinks": "Data stored in class attributes and properties; no external system calls, network interactions, or data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input response dicts into class attributes through safe get() calls; no dynamic code execution or unsafe data handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Regex usage is straightforward and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely for data encapsulation and validation, with no external system interactions, code injection, or malicious logic. It performs key presence validation and exposes data via properties. Regex patterns are used solely for parsing specific string formats, not for code execution. No obfuscation or malicious activity is evident. The structure is clear, and the purpose is to model Athena response data safely.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and free of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1) are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
