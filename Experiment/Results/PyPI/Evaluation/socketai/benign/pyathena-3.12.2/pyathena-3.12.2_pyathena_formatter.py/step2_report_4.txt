  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report states that the code is a standard utility for SQL formatting, with proper escaping, no malicious behavior, and no obfuscation. The malware score is 0, and the security risk is low (0.2). The confidence is high (0.9).\n\n- **Verdict:** The reasoning is sound. The code indeed performs safe string escaping, manages formatting, and generates unload commands with UUIDs and dates in a controlled manner. No signs of malicious intent or backdoors are evident.\n\n- **Score suggestion:** The scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is a utility for SQL query formatting and unload command generation, with no suspicious behavior. Malware score is 0, and security risk is low.\n\n- **Verdict:** Consistent with the code. The use of UUIDs and date in `wrap_unload` is standard. No malicious logic.\n\n- **Score suggestion:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Focuses on the safe construction of unload commands and string escaping. It notes that the code is typical for such utilities, with no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Verdict:** The reasoning aligns with the code. The use of UUIDs and date for S3 paths is standard. No obfuscation or malicious activity.\n\n- **Score suggestion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Highlights that the main potential risk is the use of string interpolation (`operation % kwargs`) which could be dangerous if parameters are untrusted. It recognizes that the code is a utility for SQL formatting, with no malicious behavior, but notes the risk of SQL injection if parameters are malicious.\n\n- **Verdict:** This is a valid concern. The code uses parameter substitution via `%`, which can be risky if parameters are not sanitized. However, the code does escape strings for SQL safety and type checks, which mitigates this risk.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate, as no malware is present.\n\n- **Security risk:** Slightly higher (0.3) due to potential injection if parameters are malicious and not properly sanitized, but overall, the code's escaping reduces this risk.\n\n- **Score adjustment:** The report's assessment is fair. No need to raise malware score; the risk is about injection, not malware.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to others, emphasizing that the code is a safe utility for SQL formatting, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Verdict:** Consistent with the code. The dynamic generation of unload commands with UUIDs and date is standard.\n\n- **Score suggestion:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, which is justified. The code performs formatting and string escaping, with no malicious payloads or network activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk score:** Most reports assign low risk (0.1-0.3). Given the potential for SQL injection if parameters are malicious and unescaped, but noting that the code escapes strings and performs type checks, a risk score of around 0.2-0.3 seems appropriate.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malware or malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear, well-structured.\n- **Security risk score:** **0.2** — slight risk if parameters are malicious, but mitigated by escaping functions.\n\n### Additional notes:\n\n- The core concern is the use of string interpolation (`operation % kwargs`). While the code escapes strings and checks types, if untrusted parameters are passed without proper sanitization, injection could occur. However, the code's design reduces this risk significantly.\n\n- No signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious network activity.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent, and the code appears safe and standard for SQL query formatting utilities. The scores are reasonable, and no major adjustments are necessary.",
