  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n**Summary:** The code provides utility functions for SQL formatting, escaping, and unload wrapping. No malicious behavior or vulnerabilities are detected.  \n**Malware score:** 0 — justified.  \n**Risk score:** 0.2 — reasonable, as it's a utility module with minimal risk.  \n**Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.  \n**Conclusion:** Accurate; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n**Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing safe SQL formatting, UUIDs for unload paths, and no malicious activity.  \n**Malware score:** 0 — justified.  \n**Risk score:** 0.2 — appropriate, considering the safe use of UUIDs and escaping.  \n**Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.  \n**Conclusion:** Valid assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n**Summary:** Focuses on standard escaping, dynamic unload paths, and safe formatting. No malicious activity.  \n**Malware score:** 0 — justified.  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 — aligns with the benign nature.  \n**Obfuscated:** 0 — clear code.  \n**Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n**Summary:** Highlights that the core string interpolation with `'operation % kwargs'` could pose injection risks if parameters are untrusted, but no malicious intent is evident.  \n**Malware score:** 0 — correct, no malware detected.  \n**Risk score:** 0.3 — slightly higher due to potential injection if parameters are malicious, but the code escapes and formats parameters carefully.  \n**Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent.  \n**Critical point:** The report correctly notes that string interpolation can be risky if parameters are untrusted, but overall, the code uses escaping functions to mitigate this.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n**Summary:** Similar to previous, emphasizing the safe handling of parameters and standard practices. No malicious activity.  \n**Malware score:** 0 — justified.  \n**Risk score:** 0.2 — reasonable.  \n**Obfuscated:** 0 — clear code.  \n**Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** All reports agree on 0, which is consistent with the code. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.3, with the highest being due to the potential for SQL injection if parameters are malicious and unescaped. The code does escape parameters, which mitigates this risk.\n\n### Final thoughts:\n\n- The main potential concern is the use of string interpolation (`operation % kwargs`) in `DefaultParameterFormatter`. If parameters are untrusted and escape functions are not correctly applied, injection could occur. However, the code explicitly uses escape functions and type checks, which reduces this risk significantly.\n- The code's design aligns with standard practices for SQL formatting utilities.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — considering the potential for injection if parameters are malicious, but mitigated by escaping.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate. The code appears safe, with a minor security consideration regarding parameter sanitization, which is well-handled here.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No changes needed to the scores; the analysis aligns with the code's behavior and structure.",
