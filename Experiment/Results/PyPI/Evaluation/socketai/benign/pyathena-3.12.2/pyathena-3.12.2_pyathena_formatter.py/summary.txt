  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard utility for SQL formatting with proper mitigation against injection risks. No malware or obfuscation is present. The potential for injection exists if parameters are malicious and unescaped, but current safeguards are adequate. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."
