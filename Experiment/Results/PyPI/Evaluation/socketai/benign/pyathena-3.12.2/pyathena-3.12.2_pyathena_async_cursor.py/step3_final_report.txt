  "purpose": "Defines asynchronous cursor classes for executing and managing Athena queries, providing non-blocking operations via threading and futures.",
  "sources": "Method parameters, external query IDs, and internal method calls (_execute, _poll, _cancel).",
  "sinks": "Query execution, result set retrieval, and query status polling, primarily through method calls and thread execution.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into query execution methods; query IDs are used to poll status and collect results; data flows from external query IDs to result set objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Uses standard threading and futures for concurrency.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard async cursor pattern for Athena, leveraging ThreadPoolExecutor for concurrency. No malicious behaviors such as network exfiltration, code injection, or obfuscation are present. External methods (_execute, _poll, _cancel) are assumed safe and are typical in such implementations. The code structure is clear, with appropriate exception handling and resource management. No signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities are evident from this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured asynchronous Athena cursor implementation with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The security risk is minimal, and the malware likelihood is negligible. The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are justified and appropriate.",
