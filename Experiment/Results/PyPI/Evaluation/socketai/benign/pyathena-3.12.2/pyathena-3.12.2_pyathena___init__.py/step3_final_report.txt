{
  "purpose": "Defines data types, constants, and connection factory for the pyathena database driver, facilitating connections to Amazon Athena.",
  "sources": "The connect() function receives connection parameters via *args and **kwargs; the import of * from pyathena.error reads symbols from the error module.",
  "sinks": "The connect() function passes untrusted input directly to the Connection class; no other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow from connect() into the Connection constructor; no data is processed or validated within this code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import 'from pyathena.error import *' which can hide symbols; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup for a Python database driver, defining types, constants, and a connection function. The wildcard import is common but could potentially import unintended symbols. The connect() function delegates to the Connection class without processing input, which is typical for such infrastructure code. No network activity, data leaks, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The overall structure and content are benign, with minimal security risk primarily due to import practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard library setup for a database driver with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The wildcard import is a minor concern but not malicious. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is very low (~0.1).",
