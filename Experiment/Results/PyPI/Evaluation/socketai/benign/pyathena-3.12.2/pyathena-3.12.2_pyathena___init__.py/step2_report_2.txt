  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a standard setup for a database driver, defining types, constants, and a connection function. The import of `from pyathena.error import *` is noted but common in libraries.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — slightly elevated due to the wildcard import, but not significant.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the benign nature of the code, with no suspicious behavior. The use of `import *` is typical but could be refined.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the delegation of parameters to the Connection class.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malware.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — minimal.\n- **Assessment:** Accurately notes that the code is standard, with no malicious intent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—types, constants, connection setup, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly concludes the code is benign.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous, with focus on the import pattern and connection function.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** The code appears safe and standard.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, with emphasis on the connection setup and import statements.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1.\n- **Assessment:** The slight risk score is justified due to the wildcard import, but overall, the code remains benign.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis and Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious activity—no network calls, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 in all reports, which is correct; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, mainly due to the wildcard import, which is a common pattern in library code but could be a vector for hidden symbols in other contexts.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minor, related to import practices, but not inherently dangerous.\n\n**Overall, the code appears benign, well-structured, and typical for a database driver library.**",
