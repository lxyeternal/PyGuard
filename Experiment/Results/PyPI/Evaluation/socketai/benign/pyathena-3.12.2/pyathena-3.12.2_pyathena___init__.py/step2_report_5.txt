  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard setup for a Python DB API interface for Amazon Athena, defining types, constants, and connection functions. It notes the wildcard import `from pyathena.error import *` as a potential concern but considers it typical in library code. No malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities are detected.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the wildcard import as a minor concern but not malicious. The overall code appears benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code delegates connection setup to the `Connection` class, with no signs of malicious activity. The use of `*args` and `**kwargs` is standard but could be a concern if misused externally.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n\n- **Assessment:** No malicious intent detected. The delegation pattern is typical.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code is a straightforward database interface setup with no signs of malicious behavior. The wildcard import is noted but considered standard.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9\n\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with emphasis on the import pattern and connection setup. No malicious behavior or security issues identified.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same general conclusion—standard infrastructure code with no malicious intent. The wildcard import is noted but not considered malicious.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** The code is standard library setup code, defining types, constants, and a connection factory. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are evident.\n\n- **Wildcard import concern:** While `from pyathena.error import *` can potentially import unintended symbols, this is a common pattern in Python library code and not inherently malicious. No malicious symbols or behaviors are indicated.\n\n- **Flow of untrusted data:** The `connect()` function passes arguments to the `Connection` class without processing or sanitization. However, this is typical for database driver code, which relies on the `Connection` class to handle such concerns.\n\n- **Security risks:** Very low. No hardcoded secrets, no network activity, no data leaks, no obfuscated code.\n\n- **Malware potential:** None detected.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, mostly due to wildcard import concern, but standard in library code)\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis code is standard, well-structured library setup code with no malicious or suspicious features.",
