{
  "purpose": "Defines types, constants, and connection functions for the PyAthena database driver, facilitating database interactions with Athena.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library, third-party 'pyathena' package, and environment variables via __version__ and user_agent_extra.",
  "sinks": "The connect() function creates a Connection object, which internally may handle untrusted parameters; however, no direct untrusted input handling is visible.",
  "flows": "Input args and kwargs passed to connect() flow into the Connection constructor; no explicit flow of untrusted data is observed within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The import 'from pyathena.error import *' can introduce hidden or unintended symbols into the namespace, but this is common in library code. No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily establishes types, constants, and a connection factory for the PyAthena package. It imports errors, defines type objects, and provides overloads for connect(). No external data sources, environment variables, or sensitive data handling is evident. The import of all error symbols could potentially obscure malicious symbols if present in 'pyathena.error', but this is standard practice for package internal error handling. No obfuscated code, network operations, or data leaks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for a database driver setup, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It serves as infrastructure code for database connectivity, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
