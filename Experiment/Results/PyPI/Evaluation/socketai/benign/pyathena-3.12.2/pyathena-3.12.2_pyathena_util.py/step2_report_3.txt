  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as utility functions for parsing S3 URIs, converting string values to booleans, and implementing retry logic for AWS API calls.\n- The code relies on standard libraries (`re`, `typing`, `tenacity`, `pyathena`) and employs common patterns.\n- No report indicates suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code.\n- The exception handling and retry logic are typical for AWS SDK interactions.\n- The functions do not perform file operations, network transmissions, or data exfiltration.\n- The retry mechanism accepts any callable, which is standard for such utility functions, though it could theoretically be misused if malicious functions are passed.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- No issues are present in the code based on the reports.\n- The code functions as intended for its purpose.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- No logical errors or flaws are identified.\n- The exception list in `RetryConfig` is limited to specific AWS error codes, which is appropriate.\n- The regex pattern for S3 URIs appears correct.\n- The `strtobool` function is ported safely, with proper handling of invalid inputs.\n- The retry logic correctly uses exponential backoff.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- Security risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), consistent with the benign nature.\n- Confidence levels are high (0.9-1.0), which is reasonable given the straightforward code.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports justify higher risk scores; the code is standard utility code.\n- The only minor concern is the broad acceptance of any callable in `retry_api_call`, but this is typical and not malicious.\n\n### Malware assessment:\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious code.\n- The code does not perform any suspicious actions.\n\n### Potential assumptions or vulnerabilities:\n- The assumption that exception objects contain specific error codes is standard.\n- No vulnerabilities are introduced by the code as it does not process untrusted data in a harmful way.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis: all indicate no malware, minimal security risk, and high confidence.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, standard utility functions with minimal security considerations)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard, well-structured utility module for AWS-related error handling and data parsing. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Keep malware score at 0.\n- Keep obfuscated score at 0.\n- Maintain a very low security risk score (~0.1).\n- Overall, the supply chain security risk for this code is minimal.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a detailed score summary or further analysis.",
