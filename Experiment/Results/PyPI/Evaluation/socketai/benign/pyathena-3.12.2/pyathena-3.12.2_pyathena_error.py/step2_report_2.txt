  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:  \n   The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to database errors, inheriting from Python's built-in Exception classes. It also defines a list `__all__` for module exports. There are no functions, data processing, external input/output, or dynamic code execution.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:  \n   - **Code correctness**: The code appears syntactically correct and follows standard Python practices for defining exception classes.\n   - **Malicious activity**: No evidence of malicious code, such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n   - **Obfuscation**: The code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n   - **Security risks**: No signs of security vulnerabilities, secrets, or insecure patterns.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports**:  \n   All reports uniformly state that the code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions. They mention no external data, no dynamic behaviors, no suspicious constructs, and no malicious intent. Their confidence scores are all 1, which seems reasonable given the static, straightforward nature of the code.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code contains no malicious behavior.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n   - **Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, which is justified. There are no security risks identified.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns**:\n   - The reports are thorough and consistent. No anomalies or suspicious claims are present.\n   - The code's purpose is clear, and there are no assumptions or questionable claims.\n\n6. **Final Estimation**:\n   - Given the uniformity and the straightforward nature of the code, I agree with the reported scores:\n     - **Malware**: 0\n     - **Obfuscated**: 0\n     - **Risk**: 0\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe code is a standard, benign exception hierarchy for database error handling. No security issues, malware, or obfuscation are present. The reports' assessments are accurate and reasonable.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:  \nNo changes needed to the scores or analysis. The code is safe and appropriate for its intended purpose.",
