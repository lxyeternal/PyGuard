{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to database errors and warnings for use in a larger database handling module.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; all data is statically defined in class and variable declarations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code only defines exception classes without performing any data processing or external actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only establishes class hierarchies.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code follows standard Python practices for custom exception definitions. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes for database-related errors, inheriting from built-in Python exceptions. The classes are straightforward and lack any dynamic or runtime behaviors. No input/output operations, network activity, or data manipulations are present. The structure is typical for exception handling modules, and there is no indication of malicious intent or malicious code. The code does not perform any operations beyond class declarations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of custom exception class definitions for database error handling, with no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks identified.",
