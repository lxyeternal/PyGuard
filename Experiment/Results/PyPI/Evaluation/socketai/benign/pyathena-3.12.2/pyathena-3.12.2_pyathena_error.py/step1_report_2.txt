  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for database error handling",
  "sources": "No external input or data reads; only class definitions and string constants",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or output operations",
  "flows": "None; no data flow from source to sink",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code follows standard Python class declaration patterns for exceptions",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of custom exception classes related to database errors, inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class. It includes a list __all__ for export and multiple exception subclasses that are typical for database error handling. No input, no data leaks, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious behavior. The structure appears straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code. The code appears to be a standard exception hierarchy implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely defines exception classes for database errors without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a benign module intended for use in larger database-related Python projects.",
