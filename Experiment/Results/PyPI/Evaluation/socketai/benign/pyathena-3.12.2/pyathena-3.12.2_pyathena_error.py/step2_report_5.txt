  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to ensure the assessments are accurate and consistent with the code.\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for database error handling.\n   - It includes a list `__all__` for export.\n   - All classes inherit from `Exception` or other custom exceptions, with no dynamic code, input/output, or external interactions.\n   - No obfuscation, no malicious patterns, no data leaks, no network activity.\n   - The code is static, straightforward, and typical for error handling modules.\n\n2. **Assessment of Malicious Behavior and Security Risks:**\n   - The reports uniformly conclude the code is benign, with malware scores of 0.\n   - No suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.\n   - No evidence of malicious intent.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the static, standard nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Discrepancies:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n   - No anomalies or errors are observed in the logic or reasoning.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which is reasonable given the straightforward analysis.\n\n5. **Recommendations:**\n   - The risk scores are all set to 0, which is appropriate.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n**Final Estimation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The reports' assessments are accurate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If I were to assign my own scores based on the review:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign nature of the code.",
