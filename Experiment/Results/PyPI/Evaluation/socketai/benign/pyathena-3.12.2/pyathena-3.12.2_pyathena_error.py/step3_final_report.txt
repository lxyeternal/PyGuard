{
  "purpose": "Define a hierarchy of custom exception classes for database error handling, providing clear categorization of database-related errors.",
  "sources": "The code reads static class definitions; no external input or data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The code consists solely of class declarations; no data flows or dynamic execution paths are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, static, and adheres to standard exception class definitions. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of custom exception classes for database errors, inheriting from Python's Exception hierarchy. It includes a list __all__ for module exports. The code is static, with no dynamic code, input/output, or external interactions. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0. The confidence scores are all 1, consistent with the static and straightforward analysis. No issues or vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign exception hierarchy module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security concerns. The scores and assessments in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
