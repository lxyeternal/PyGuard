{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to database errors and warnings",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources present in the code",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points, as the code only defines classes",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths; just class definitions",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs present",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for various custom exceptions inheriting from Exception. There are no data inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors. No code injection, malicious logic, or security risks are evident. It appears to be a straightforward module for exception handling in a database context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign set of exception class definitions with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
