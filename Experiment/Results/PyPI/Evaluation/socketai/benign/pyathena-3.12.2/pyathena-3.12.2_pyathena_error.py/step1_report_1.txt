  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for database error handling.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources; class definitions are static.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static class definitions with no execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; standard exception class definitions with no suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes related to database errors, inheriting from built-in Exception classes. There are no data input, output, or external communication points. No dynamic code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. All classes are straightforward and serve as error types. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or suspicious behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of custom exception class definitions for database error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
