{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for database-related errors.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading occurs in the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output; exception classes are defined but not used for data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; this code only declares classes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to database errors. It includes an inheritance hierarchy and a list of exception class names for exporting. There are no data inputs, outputs, or external interactions. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as code injection, data leakage, or backdoors, is detected. The code appears to be a standard exception module for a database library.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward declaration of exception classes with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as part of a larger system to handle database errors. No security concerns are identified.",
