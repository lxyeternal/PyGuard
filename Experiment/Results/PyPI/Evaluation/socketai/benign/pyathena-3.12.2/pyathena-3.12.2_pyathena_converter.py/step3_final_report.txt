  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for converting string data into various Python data types, used for parsing database query results or similar data sources.",
  "sources": "Input strings from external data sources such as databases or APIs, passed into conversion functions.",
  "sinks": "Converted Python objects returned for further processing; no external sinks or data leaks identified.",
  "flows": "Input strings flow into specific converter functions based on data type, resulting in Python objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. Use of standard libraries and straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple safe, standard conversion functions utilizing Python's built-in libraries. The Converter class manages mappings without dynamic code execution or external system calls. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are present. The functions perform typical data parsing tasks with no side effects or network activity. The overall structure and logic are clear and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for data conversions, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
