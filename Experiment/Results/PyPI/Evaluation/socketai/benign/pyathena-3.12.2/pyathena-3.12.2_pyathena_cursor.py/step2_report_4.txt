  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes the code as an Athena query cursor, with parameters flowing into execute functions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly identifies that query IDs are used in polling and canceling, and results are fetched via result sets.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected. The code uses standard practices.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Validates that the code appears benign, with high confidence (0.9). Malware score is 0, and security risk is low (0.2).\n\n**Assessment:** No issues found; the report's reasoning aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the code implements a database cursor for Athena, with parameters flowing into execute.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Properly notes that query IDs are stored and used for polling and cancellation, and results are fetched through standard methods.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious activity or obfuscation; standard patterns are used.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate, with high confidence (0.9). Malware score is 0, security risk is minimal.\n\n**Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity; the report's conclusion is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes the code as a typical Athena cursor, with parameters leading into query execution.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly identifies data flow from execute to result retrieval.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. External interactions are standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, with high confidence (0.9). Malware score remains 0.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious indicators; the reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes the class's role and parameters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly maps input parameters to query execution and result handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or external malicious activity. Uses standard external libraries.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-founded, high confidence (0.9). Malware score is 0.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious behavior detected; the report is consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the class's function and parameters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Appropriately describes data flow from input parameters to query execution and result handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious external calls. Patterns are standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, with high confidence (0.9). Malware score is 0.\n\n**Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity; reasoning is consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign malware score 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports indicate 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code's nature—standard database interaction with no malicious indicators—a low security risk score (~0.2) is appropriate.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (low, typical for database drivers, no sensitive info hardcoded)\n\n**Summary:** The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured implementation of an Athena query cursor, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The reports are consistent, and the reasoning aligns with the code analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**Estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThe code is safe and standard; no further action required.",
