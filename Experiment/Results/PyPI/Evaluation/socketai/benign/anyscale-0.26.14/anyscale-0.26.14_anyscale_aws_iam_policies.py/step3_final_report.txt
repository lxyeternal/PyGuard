{
  "purpose": "Defines AWS IAM policies, role assumptions, and constants for cloud deployment within the Anyscale platform, serving as static configuration data.",
  "sources": "Static definitions of policy names, ARNs, JSON policy documents, and functions generating policy dicts; no external inputs or data flows.",
  "sinks": "Policy dictionaries and role trust policies generated in-memory; no external data sinks or untrusted data outputs.",
  "flows": "Static data used to generate IAM policy structures; no dynamic or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static constants, JSON serializations, and functions producing policy dicts. It lacks external inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution. Permissions are broad but typical for cloud infrastructure setup. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code aligns with standard IAM configuration practices, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, static IAM policy and role definition module for AWS cloud deployment. No evidence of malicious activity, supply chain compromise, or hidden behaviors. The low risk score appropriately reflects the broad permissions typical in such configurations.",
