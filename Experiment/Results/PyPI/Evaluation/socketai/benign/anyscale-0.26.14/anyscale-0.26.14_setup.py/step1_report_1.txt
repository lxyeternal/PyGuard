  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for the 'anyscale' Python package, used to define package metadata, dependencies, and data files for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'anyscale/version.py', reads requirements from 'requirements.in', reads README.md for long description, and scans directories for package data files.",
  "sinks": "None identified that process untrusted data or user input; primarily reads static files and defines package metadata.",
  "flows": "Reads version info and requirements files, uses that data to configure package setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious activity detected. Uses standard library functions and setup tools as intended.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup script for Python packaging, with functions to locate version info and read requirements. It compiles package data and dependencies in a standard way. No code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration routines are present. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate package setup configuration with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It adheres to common practices for Python package distribution.",
