{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging a Python project named 'anyscale', handling package metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading version from a file, reading requirements from 'requirements.in', reading README.md for long description, walking directory for package data files.",
  "sinks": "Potentially reading untrusted files (version, requirements, README), but these are static files; no direct sinks of untrusted input or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Reading version and requirements files → Using data in setup() for package configuration; no external data flow or untrusted data injection observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. The script performs standard package setup routines. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution beyond standard library functions.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical setup procedures: locating version info, reading dependencies, assembling package data, and configuring package metadata. No evidence of malicious logic, network communication, or data exfiltration. Use of regex to find version is standard. All file reads are from static, local files. No suspicious dynamic code or obfuscated patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python setup script with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It strictly manages package configuration and dependencies without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
