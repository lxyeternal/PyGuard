  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script is a standard setup configuration with no suspicious activity. It reads static files, finds version info, and sets dependencies.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe code is straightforward, uses common patterns, and no malicious behavior is evident. The functions for reading files and setting up the package are standard. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious logic.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard setup routines, no suspicious code, no dynamic execution, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (slightly above zero)\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe only point is the `securityRisk` being 0.1, which seems to reflect a very low concern, perhaps due to the use of regex or file reading. However, all operations are on static files, and no dynamic code execution or external network activity is present.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are consistent. The minimal risk score is justified given the context but can be considered slightly conservative. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above; standard setup script, no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAll operations are static and standard. No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard setup script, no malicious code, no obfuscation, no network activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe code only reads local files and configures setup parameters. No suspicious behaviors.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as others; typical packaging script, no malicious intent.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nNo suspicious code or behaviors detected.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard setup script.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is accurate.\n- **Obfuscation:** All correctly identify no obfuscation.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation in the second report (0.1), which is reasonable given the minimal concern, but overall, the scores align with the code's behavior.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or behaviors detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation patterns)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\nThe code is a typical, well-structured setup script with no indicators of malicious activity or supply chain risks.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are consistent with the code's actual behavior. No modifications are necessary. The overall assessment confirms the package setup script is benign and secure.",
