  "purpose": "Configuration and environment setup for a Python application, including AWS profile management, session tokens, and version defaults.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (implicitly via 'os.path.dirname(__file__)') and assigning constant values.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks for untrusted data or user input are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; code primarily sets constants and configuration variables.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. Variables like AWS_PROFILE and CLI_TOKEN are initialized to None but not used for secrets within this fragment.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple variable assignments and configuration constants. The only dynamic element is 'ROOT_DIR_PATH', which derives a directory path using 'os.path.dirname(__file__)', a common pattern for setting base paths. No input processing, data handling, or security-sensitive operations are present. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident, and the code does not perform any actions that could harm or leak data. It appears to be a straightforward configuration setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration snippet without malicious intent or security risks. It primarily initializes constants and configuration parameters for later use. No malicious behaviors or vulnerabilities are present in this fragment.",
