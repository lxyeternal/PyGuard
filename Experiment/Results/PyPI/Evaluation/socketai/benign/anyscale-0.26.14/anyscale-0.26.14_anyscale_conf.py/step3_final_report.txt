{
  "purpose": "Defines configuration constants and variables related to AWS profiles, session tokens, role names, Ray versioning, timeout durations, and directory paths.",
  "sources": "Uses __file__ to determine ROOT_DIR_PATH; static variable assignments for AWS_PROFILE, CLI_TOKEN, TEST_V2, ANYSCALE_IAM_ROLE_NAME, MINIMUM_RAY_VERSION, IDLE_TIMEOUT_DEFAULT_MINUTES.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or external data sinks; variables are static and not used in sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Static variable assignments with no dynamic or untrusted data flow; __file__ used solely for directory path.",
  "anomalies": "None; no suspicious, obfuscated, or malicious code patterns; variables like CLI_TOKEN and AWS_PROFILE are initialized but not used maliciously.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward configuration setup with static variable assignments and a single use of os.path.dirname(__file__) for path determination. No user input, environment variables, network activity, or code execution is present. Variables are placeholders and do not contain secrets or sensitive data. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected. The code's purpose is purely to set constants and configuration parameters, with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a static configuration module. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
