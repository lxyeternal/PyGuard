{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define configuration variables and constants related to AWS profiles, tokens, and Ray versioning for a larger system, possibly involving cloud or cluster management.",
  "sources": "The only source of data input is the environment variable via os.path.dirname(__file__), which determines the directory path of the current script.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data leading to data leaks, system commands, or network activity.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks are present. The code mainly initializes variables.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. All variables are initialized with either None, constants, or derived from standard library functions.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up configuration constants and global variables, including AWS profile, tokens, role names, minimum Ray version, timeout durations, and directory paths. There is no user input, network communication, or code execution involved. The usage of environment variables and static strings does not pose a security risk by itself. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be safe and primarily used for setting up environment parameters.",
