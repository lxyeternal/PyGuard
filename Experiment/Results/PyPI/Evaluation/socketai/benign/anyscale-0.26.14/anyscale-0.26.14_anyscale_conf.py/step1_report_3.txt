{
  "purpose": "This code appears to initialize configuration variables and constants related to AWS profiles, tokens, and versioning for a larger application, possibly related to Ray or Anyscale services.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, module imports, and constant assignments",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data flows or external data handling observed",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink flows; the code only sets variables and constants without processing untrusted input",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hardcoded secrets are present; the code only defines static configuration values",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'os' module to determine the directory path and defines several configuration variables, some with default or hardcoded values. No user input, environment variable reads, or external data sources are used. No code execution, network operations, or sensitive data handling is observed. The variables seem to serve as configuration constants for larger system components.",
  "conclusion": "There is no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, or security risks identified in this code fragment. It functions solely as a configuration setup with static values.",
