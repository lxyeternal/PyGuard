  "purpose": "Define configuration constants and environment variables for a system related to AWS, Anyscale, and Ray clusters.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (os.path.dirname(__file__)), hardcoded strings and optional variables.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data flows into security-critical operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables and hardcoded strings into configuration parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets configuration constants and environment parameters. It includes an optional AWS profile, a token placeholder, version strings, role names, and timeout settings. There are no dynamic inputs, no use of untrusted data sources, and no actions that could lead to data leaks or system compromise. The code appears standard for configuration setup, with no malicious or suspicious behavior evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any network activity, data leakage, or other malicious actions.",
