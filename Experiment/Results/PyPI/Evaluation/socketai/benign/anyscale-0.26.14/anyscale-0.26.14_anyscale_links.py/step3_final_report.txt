  "purpose": "Store a URL link to documentation related to dependency management in cluster environments.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of a URL string to a constant variable.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external inputs; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "N/A – static assignment; no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or dynamic behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a URL string to a constant variable, serving as a static reference. It involves no user input, external data fetching, or code execution. The code is minimal, clear, and intended for configuration or documentation purposes. No malicious or security-risk behaviors are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static URL assignment with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The reports accurately assess the code as safe, and no modifications are necessary.",
