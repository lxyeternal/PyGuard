  "purpose": "Store a URL string for documentation related to cluster environment configuration.",
  "sources": "The assignment of the URL to the variable DOCS_CLUSTER.",
  "sinks": "None, as there are no data flows leading to external systems or sensitive data exposure.",
  "flows": "None, since the code only assigns a constant value to a variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code simply stores a static URL.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single constant variable holding a URL string intended for documentation referencing. There are no inputs, no dynamic data, no user interaction, and no external calls or data manipulations. The code does not perform any network operations or contain any obfuscated or suspicious constructs. It appears to be a straightforward, benign code snippet used for configuration or documentation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is harmless and serves as a static reference to documentation. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
