  "purpose": "Define configuration flags for enabling BYOD and setting default working directory in a CLI tool.",
  "sources": "Assignment of string constants, likely used elsewhere in the code to toggle features or specify paths.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "Constants are used as identifiers or keys; no data flow from input to output is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code only consists of two string variable assignments used as configuration flags. There are no input sources, data processing, or sensitive operations. The code appears to be straightforward configuration setup without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is simple configuration code defining constants with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
