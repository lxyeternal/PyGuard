  "purpose": "Define configuration flags for CLI behavior related to BYOD and default working directory.",
  "sources": "Constant string assignments used as configuration keys.",
  "sinks": "No data input or external data sources; constants are used internally.",
  "flows": "Constants are used as identifiers; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two string constants used as configuration flags. There are no input sources, data processing, external interactions, or dynamic behaviors. The constants are straightforward, static, and descriptive. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are appropriate and justified given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward configuration flag definitions with no security concerns or malicious intent. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No modifications or escalations are necessary.",
