  "purpose": "Define configuration flags related to enabling BYOD and default working directory in a CLI tool.",
  "sources": "String literals assigned to variables; no input reading functions or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Variables assigned with string constants; no untrusted data handling or sensitive data leakage.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted input or malicious payloads.",
  "anomalies": "Simple constant definitions; no unusual code, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code only declares two constants representing configuration flags with string values. There is no input processing, data manipulation, or dynamic execution. No suspicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, straightforward configuration variable declarations for a CLI tool. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
