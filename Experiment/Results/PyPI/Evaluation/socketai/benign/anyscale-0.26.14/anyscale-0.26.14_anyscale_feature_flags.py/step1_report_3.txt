  "purpose": "Define configuration flags for enabling BYOD and setting default working directory in the Anyscale CLI",
  "sources": "String assignments to constants indicating configuration options",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or external data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only declares constants",
  "anomalies": "None; the code consists solely of constant string definitions with no suspicious or unusual patterns",
  "analysis": "The code declares two string constants for configuration flags, which are straightforward and typical for setting options in a CLI. There are no input handling, data processing, or external communications. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are present. The code's simplicity and clarity suggest it is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple declaration of configuration flag constants for CLI options. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, malicious intent, or security risks.",
