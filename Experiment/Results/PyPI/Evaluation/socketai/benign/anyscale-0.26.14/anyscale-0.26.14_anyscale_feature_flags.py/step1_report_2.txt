  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; constants are used statically.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no obfuscated code, no suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two constant string assignments intended for configuration flags. There are no functions, input handling, data processing, or external interactions. The code is straightforward and static, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple configuration constant definitions with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
