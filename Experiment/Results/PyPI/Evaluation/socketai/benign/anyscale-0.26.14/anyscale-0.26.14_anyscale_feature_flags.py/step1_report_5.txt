  "purpose": "Define constants for enabling BYOD and default working directory in the Anyscale CLI.",
  "sources": "Assignment of string constants, likely used elsewhere in the application.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data input or output operations observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks, as this code only sets constant string variables.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, obfuscation, or hidden mechanisms detected. Constants appear straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two string constants for configuration flags in the CLI. There are no input/output operations, no secret data, nor suspicious constructs. The code appears to be a simple configuration setup, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of constant definitions for CLI flags. There are no malicious behaviors, security issues, or obfuscation present.",
