  "anomalies": "Absence of any logic, input handling, or suspicious code; minimal code content.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a version string to the variable __version__. There are no sources of input, no sinks, no data flows, and no suspicious or malicious behavior present. The code appears to be a standard version declaration typical in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains only a version string assignment with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is a typical component of a package's metadata.",
