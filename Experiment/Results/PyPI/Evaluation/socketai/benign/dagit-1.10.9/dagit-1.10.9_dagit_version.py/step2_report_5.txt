  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and evaluate their accuracy, consistency, and any potential issues.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is simply assigning a version string to `__version__`.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or suspicious behavior in the code snippet.\n   - The code is benign and standard practice in Python packaging.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - No factual errors are evident; all reports are consistent and accurate.\n   - They uniformly recognize the code as benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is just a straightforward version string assignment, there is no reason to assign a higher risk.\n   - All scores are correctly set to 0, reflecting no security risk.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions; they correctly identify the code as standard and benign.\n   - No unwarranted claims are present.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and aligned with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate, thorough, and consistent. They correctly identify the code as benign, standard practice, and free of security issues.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code snippet is a straightforward version string assignment with no security concerns.",
