  "purpose": "Assign a version string to the __version__ variable in a Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only assigns a static string to a variable.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code is a simple assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present; the code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static version string to __version__, a common practice in Python packaging. No inputs, outputs, or external dependencies are involved. The code is free of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and high confidence in this assessment. No anomalies or suspicious activity are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless version declaration with no security concerns or malicious intent. The existing reports are accurate and appropriate; no modifications are necessary.",
