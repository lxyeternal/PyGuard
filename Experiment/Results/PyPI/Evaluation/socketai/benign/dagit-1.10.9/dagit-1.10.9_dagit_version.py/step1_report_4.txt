  "sinks": "No potential sinks; no data leakage or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow, as there are no operations beyond assigning a string to __version__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code simply assigns a version string.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to the __version__ variable. It is a common practice in Python packages for versioning. There are no input/output operations, no use of external data sources, no suspicious constructs, and no embedded or obfuscated code. The code is minimal and standard for version declaration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, no suspicious activities, and no security risks.",
