  "purpose": "Standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project, reading metadata and version info.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst' for description, 'dagit/version.py' for version via exec().",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static file reads only.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow; static data from files.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to load version, which could be risky if 'version.py' is compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with straightforward structure. The only potential concern is the use of exec() on 'version.py', which is common but could execute malicious code if the file is tampered with. No network activity, user input, or obfuscation is present. The code does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. The risk associated with exec() is minimal if 'version.py' is trusted and static. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign setup configuration with a minor security consideration regarding exec(). No malware or obfuscation detected. The overall security risk is very low, with a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a small risk score (~0.2) due to exec() usage. The confidence in this assessment is high (0.9).",
