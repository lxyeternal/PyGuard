  "purpose": "Registering the 'dagit' library version with the DagsterLibraryRegistry for tracking or management purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'dagster_shared.libraries' and 'dagit.version'.",
  "sinks": "The register() method invocation that may store or log the version information.",
  "flows": "Importing version info -> calling register() with library name and version.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual dynamic execution, and no suspicious data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a registry module and a version string, then registers the library 'dagit' with its version. This is a typical pattern for package tracking or registration. No data is read from untrusted sources, nor is data sent elsewhere. No security risks, malicious behavior, or anomalies are present. The code is straightforward and aligns with standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply registers version information for tracking purposes and does not exhibit any malicious or security-compromising behavior. It is safe and standard.",
