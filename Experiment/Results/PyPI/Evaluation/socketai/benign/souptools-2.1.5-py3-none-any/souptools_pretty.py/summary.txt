  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function for formatting the string output of a SoupSieve object, with no malicious intent or security risks. The regex-based parsing is straightforward and safe, and the function does not perform any external operations or handle untrusted data beyond string formatting. All evidence supports a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1)."
