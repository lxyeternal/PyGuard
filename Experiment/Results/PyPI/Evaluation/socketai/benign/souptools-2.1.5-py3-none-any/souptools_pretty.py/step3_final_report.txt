  "purpose": "To prettify the string representation of a SoupSieve object for easier debugging and visualization.",
  "sources": "The string output of the object obtained via str(obj).",
  "sinks": "None; the function only processes and formats a string, with no external data sinks or outputs that could lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input string (from str(obj)) → regex matching and indentation adjustments → formatted string output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior; the regex patterns are straightforward, and the function performs simple string formatting without side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code parses the string representation of a SoupSieve object using regex patterns to identify structural tokens such as parentheses, brackets, class names, parameters, and strings. It adjusts indentation levels accordingly to produce a more readable, pretty-printed version. The process involves matching tokens, updating indentation, and appending formatted segments. The code does not execute any untrusted code, perform network operations, or handle sensitive data. The regex patterns are simple and targeted solely at formatting. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The function is a utility for debugging purposes, with minimal security implications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function for formatting the string output of a SoupSieve object, with no malicious intent or security risks. The regex-based parsing is straightforward and safe, and the function does not perform any external operations or handle untrusted data beyond string formatting. All evidence supports a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1).",
