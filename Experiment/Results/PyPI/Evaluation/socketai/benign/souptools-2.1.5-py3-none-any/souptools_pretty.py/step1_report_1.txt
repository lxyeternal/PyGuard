{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to prettify the string representation of a `SoupSieve` object, mainly for debugging purposes. It formats the object with indentation and line breaks to improve readability.",
  "sources": "The source data is the string representation of the `SoupSieve` object passed to the `pretty()` function, generated by `str(obj)`.",
  "sinks": "The function processes the string, matching against various regex tokens and building an indented output string. No untrusted data is executed or directly affects system operations.",
  "flows": "Input string (from `str(obj)`) is tokenized via regex matches; these tokens influence how the output string is constructed with indentation and formatting.",
  "anomalies": "The code only uses regex matching and string concatenation; it does not execute any code, evaluate untrusted inputs, or perform network operations. There are no hidden backdoors, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes multiple regex patterns to identify specific tokens in the string representation of the object. It iterates over the string, matching tokens and adjusting indentation levels accordingly, appending formatted substrings to the output list. This process is purely string manipulation, with no execution of external code or data. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The logic is straightforward and limited to formatting.",
  "conclusion": "There is no indication of malicious intent, malicious code execution, or security risks within this code. It is a benign utility for formatting object strings for debugging. The code relies solely on regex matching and string concatenation, with no harmful side effects.",
