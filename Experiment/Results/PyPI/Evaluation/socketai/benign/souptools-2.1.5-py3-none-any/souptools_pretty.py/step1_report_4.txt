{
  "purpose": "This code provides a pretty-printing function for debugging objects, specifically targeting the `SoupSieve` selector objects to improve readability.",
  "sources": "The source is the string representation of the `SoupSieve` selector objects (`str(obj)`), which are then parsed with regex matches.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain data sinks that process untrusted input for security effects like file writes, network communication, or system commands.",
  "flows": "The flow involves taking the string representation of an object, matching regex tokens to identify structure, and inserting newlines and indentation for readability.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious or unusual code patterns, backdoors, or hidden behaviors. The regex patterns are standard and used solely for formatting. No dynamic code execution, environment variable misuse, or external interactions are present.",
  "analysis": "The function converts an object's string output into a formatted, indented string for easier debugging. It uses regex to parse tokens related to syntax (like brackets, parentheses, quotes) and adjusts indentation accordingly. The code appears to be purely for formatting and debugging support, with no malicious intent or harmful operations. It does not execute or modify external data, nor does it perform any network or file operations. The regex patterns and control flow are standard for parsing structured text.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless utility function designed for improving debug output readability. It does not contain malware, malicious behaviors, or security risks. It simply processes and formats string representations of objects for better visualization.",
