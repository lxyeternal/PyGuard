{
  "purpose": "This code provides a pretty-printing function for objects related to the SoupSieve library, specifically for visualizing SelectorList objects for debugging purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the string representation of the object via str(obj) and matches against various regular expressions defined in the TOKENS dictionary.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to external systems or perform any insecure operations. It mainly processes strings for formatting.",
  "flows": "The object is converted to string, then the string is scanned from start to end. Matches are made against regex tokens, and the output is constructed based on matched tokens, adjusting indentation accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a series of regex matches to format the string; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior is evident. No dynamic execution or external calls are present. The regex patterns are designed solely for formatting and parsing string representations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward string formatter that enhances readability of a specific object type's string output. It employs regex matching and simple control flow to add indentation and line breaks. No external inputs, network operations, or security-sensitive functions are involved. The regex patterns and formatting logic are consistent with non-malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function aimed at improving debug output formatting. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The design is simple, focused solely on string manipulation for presentation purposes.",
