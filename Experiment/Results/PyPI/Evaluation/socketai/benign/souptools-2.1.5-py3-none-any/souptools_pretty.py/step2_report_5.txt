  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, the correctness of their scores, and whether any issues are present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a benign utility for pretty-printing the string representation of a `SoupSieve` object, with no malicious intent or security risks.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code only performs regex-based string formatting, with no code execution or external interactions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1 — appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the straightforward nature of the regex parsing for debugging purposes.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly notes the absence of malicious behavior, with no code execution or external I/O.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Also states that the code is safe, purely for formatting, with no malicious intent.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly points out that regex parsing is straightforward and does not involve dangerous operations.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — slightly higher securityRisk score, but given the code's nature, this is conservative.\n- **Justification for securityRisk=0.2:** Since the code only matches and formats strings, the risk is minimal. The slight elevation might be a conservative default, but it’s not justified by actual malicious behavior.\n- **Verdict:** The securityRisk score could be lowered to 0 for consistency, but it's not unreasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as others, emphasizing the benign nature of the utility.\n- **Assessment:** Correct, no malicious behavior or security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar assessment, emphasizing the utility's benign purpose.\n- **Assessment:** Correct, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. I agree with a malware score of 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is straightforward regex-based string formatting, not obfuscated. Score of 0 is correct.\n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports mostly agree on 0, except Report 3's 0.2. Given the code's nature, the security risk is negligible. I would set it to **0** for consistency and accuracy.\n\n### Final Personal Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\n**This code is a benign, utility function for formatting object string representations for debugging, with no malicious or security concerns.**",
