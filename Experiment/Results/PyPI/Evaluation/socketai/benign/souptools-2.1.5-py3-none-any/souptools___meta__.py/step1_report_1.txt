{
  "purpose": "This code defines a semantic versioning system for a software project, including parsing, validation, and comparison of version strings following PEP 440 conventions.",
  "sources": "Input data is from the version string passed to parse_version function; internal constants and regex patterns are used for parsing and validation.",
  "sinks": "The code does not perform any data output, external network calls, or insecure data handling. It simply processes version strings internally.",
  "flows": "parse_version receives a version string, uses regex to extract components, maps them into a Version object, which is then used for comparison and representation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns detected. The code relies solely on standard Python libraries, regex parsing, and internal validation. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious activities are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured implementation of semantic version parsing and validation according to specified rules. It includes detailed validation to prevent implicit pre-releases or post-releases, and provides accessor methods for version components. No external network access, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign version management utility designed to handle semantic versioning with comprehensive validation. No signs of malicious intent or security risks detected.",
