{
  "purpose": "The code implements a semantic versioning system following PEP 440, providing parsing, validation, comparison, and string formatting for version strings.",
  "sources": "Reads version strings via regex parsing; internal constants and mappings for version components.",
  "sinks": "None; internal processing only, no external data output or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input version string -> parse_version -> Version object -> validation and comparison methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured utility for managing and validating semantic versions. It uses regex for parsing, enforces strict validation rules to prevent implicit pre/post-releases, and provides comparison and formatting methods. There are no external data interactions, network activity, or obfuscated code. The validation logic is thorough and aligns with best practices, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, reliable version management utility with no malicious or security concerns. It does not perform any external operations or contain suspicious patterns. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and justified.",
