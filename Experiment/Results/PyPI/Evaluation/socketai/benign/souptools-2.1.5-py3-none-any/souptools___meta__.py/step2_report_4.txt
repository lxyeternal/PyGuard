  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward implementation of semantic version parsing, validation, and comparison following PEP 440 conventions.\n- It uses regex for parsing, with internal constants and mappings.\n- Validation logic is detailed, preventing implicit pre-releases, post-releases, and invalid version parts.\n- No external data handling, network activity, or file I/O.\n- No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n- No evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or malware.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** Correctly identifies the code as benign, focusing on version parsing/validation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The code is a utility for version management, with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the code's role in version parsing, validation, and comparison, with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No external or malicious activity detected.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, confirms the code's benign nature, focusing on parsing and validation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** The scoring aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—no malicious behavior, purely version management.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as others, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis & Justification**\n\n- **Code presence:** The code is as expected for a version parsing utility.\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports. No malicious activity or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0. The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** 0. The code does not perform any insecure operations or external interactions.\n\n**Potential concerns:** No signs of supply chain attack vectors, malicious backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Estimation**\n\nGiven the detailed review, I agree with the provided scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, well-structured version management utility with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly assess the code as benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk indicators. The scores are justified and should remain as is.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores:  \n- **malware:** 0  \n- **obfuscated:** 0  \n- **securityRisk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's functionality and the analysis provided.",
