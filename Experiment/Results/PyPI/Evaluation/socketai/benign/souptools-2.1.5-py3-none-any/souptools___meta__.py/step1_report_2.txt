{
  "purpose": "This code defines and parses version information for a software project following PEP 440 standards, including version comparison, validation, and formatting.",
  "sources": "Regex pattern for parsing version strings, input argument 'ver' in parse_version function, class attributes during instantiation.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no untrusted data is used in critical security-sensitive operations such as network, file, or environment interactions.",
  "flows": "Input version string -> parse_version() -> Regex match -> extraction of version components -> creation of Version object -> validation and formatting -> output canonical version string.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, or hidden behaviors detected. The code mainly focuses on version parsing and validation without any external data handling or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The script provides a structured way to parse and validate software version strings according to specific rules. It employs regular expressions for parsing, class inheritance for structured data, and validation logic to prevent implicit pre-releases or invalid version formats. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network access, or backdoors. The code's complexity appears solely to enforce correct version formatting and comparison, which is typical for a package versioning utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version parsing and validation utility with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It strictly manages version information according to specified rules without external data dependencies or harmful operations.",
