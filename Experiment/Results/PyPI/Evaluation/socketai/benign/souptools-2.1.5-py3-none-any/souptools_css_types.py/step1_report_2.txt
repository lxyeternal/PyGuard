{
  "purpose": "The code defines immutable data structures and classes related to CSS selector parsing and handling, primarily for use in a larger CSS or HTML parsing framework.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read; the code relies on internal parameters and class instantiations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external system interactions are present, such as network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows involve instantiating immutable objects with predefined parameters, with no dynamic or untrusted data processed into sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. The code primarily defines data structures and pickling functions, with no evidence of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions for immutable data structures related to CSS selectors, with custom pickling functions for serialization. It uses type annotations and safe data handling patterns. There are no network calls, file operations, environment variable usage, or dynamic code execution. No suspicious or malicious logic, such as data exfiltration, system modification, or covert channels, is apparent. The only dynamic behavior involves pickling registration, which is standard and safe. Overall, the code appears to be a well-structured part of a CSS parsing library with no security threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of data structures for CSS selector handling, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is focused on defining immutable objects and serialization support without any external side effects or suspicious patterns.",
