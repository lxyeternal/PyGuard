  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core points:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is primarily data structure definitions for CSS selectors, with no network, file, or command execution. The pickling registration is standard.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — consistent, given the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly identifies the code as benign.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing safe data structures and serialization without external interactions.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern; no external data handling or malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.1), but still no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — possibly a conservative estimate; given the code's nature, this is acceptable.\n- **Conclusion:** Still aligns with the benign analysis.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to others, no external or malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code presence:** The code matches the description in all reports—defining immutable data structures for CSS selectors, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** All are 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Risk scores:** Mostly 0, with one at 0.1, which is reasonable given the lack of external interactions.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — the code is safe, with minimal or no security risk.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, well-structured, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements. The assigned scores reflect this appropriately.\n\n---\n\n**My overall estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
