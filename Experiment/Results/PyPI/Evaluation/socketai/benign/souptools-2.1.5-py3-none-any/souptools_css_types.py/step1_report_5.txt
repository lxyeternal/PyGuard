{
  "purpose": "Defines classes and data structures for CSS selector parsing and representation, including immutability and serialization support.",
  "sources": "No external input or untrusted data sources detected; the code defines data structures only.",
  "sinks": "No sinks processing untrusted data; the code primarily creates immutable data objects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code does not handle external inputs or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. Uses standard Python features and serialization mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code creates immutable classes to represent CSS selectors and related entities, with serialization support via pickle registration. All functions and class methods are standard and focus on data encapsulation. No network, file system, or user input handling present. No indication of malicious logic, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. The use of 'copyreg' for pickling is standard for custom classes. Overall, the code appears to be a typical data modeling module for CSS selectors with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of CSS selector data structures with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be safe and intended for parsing or representing CSS selectors in a larger system.",
