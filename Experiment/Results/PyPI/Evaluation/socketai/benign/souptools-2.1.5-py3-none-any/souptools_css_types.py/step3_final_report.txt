  "purpose": "Defines data structures for CSS selectors, including immutable classes, validation, and serialization support.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters for data classes; no external input processing.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data flows.",
  "flows": "Data flows limited to constructor arguments into immutable objects; no external or dynamic data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of well-structured, static data classes representing CSS selector components. It uses standard Python features like immutability, type annotations, and pickling registration via 'copyreg'. There are no external system interactions, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The pickling registration is a common serialization practice and does not pose inherent security risks in this context. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 in one report is justified by the use of pickling registration but remains very low, as no actual malicious activity or external data handling is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, focusing on data modeling for CSS selectors. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with the slight elevation in security risk being justified and minimal. Overall, the supply chain security risk is effectively negligible.",
