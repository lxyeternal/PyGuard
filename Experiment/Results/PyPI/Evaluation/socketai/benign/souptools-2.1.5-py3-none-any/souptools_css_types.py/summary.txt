  "conclusion": "The code is benign, focusing on data modeling for CSS selectors. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with the slight elevation in security risk being justified and minimal. Overall, the supply chain security risk is effectively negligible."
