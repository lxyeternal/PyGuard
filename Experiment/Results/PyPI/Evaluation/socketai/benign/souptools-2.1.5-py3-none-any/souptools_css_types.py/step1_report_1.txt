{
  "purpose": "The code defines data structures and classes for CSS selector parsing and handling, including immutable data containers, namespace management, and selector components.",
  "sources": "The code reads input via class constructors, especially for initializing immutable objects and namespace mappings.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network operations, file writes, or command execution are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor arguments into immutable objects; no untrusted input processing or external data handling appears to occur.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution, and no network communication or file access is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines immutable data classes and related structures for CSS selectors. It includes registration of custom pickling functions for these classes, which is standard for object serialization. The logic is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling. No suspicious patterns such as hidden backdoors, malicious data leaks, or code injections are detected. The code appears to be a clean, well-structured module for CSS selector representation and serialization, with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, focusing on data structure definitions for CSS selectors and namespace management. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks. Overall, it is safe for use in a project context.",
