{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of classes and data structures for CSS selector handling, serialization, and immutability, primarily for internal use in a larger CSS parsing or manipulation library.",
  "sources": "The code reads class definitions, constants, and method parameters such as input data for creating immutable objects, patterns, and selectors. It does not process external inputs directly, but defines structures for handling data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present. The code does not perform network operations, system commands, or data output. It only creates and manages in-memory objects.",
  "flows": "The flow involves creating immutable data structures for selectors and related entities, which can be serialized via custom pickling functions. No untrusted data flows or unsafe data handling are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious anomalies are detected. The code is well-structured, defining data classes, constants, and pickling support. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes immutable data structures for CSS selector representation, with support for serialization and deserialization. It includes validation for input types, ensuring that data remains consistent. The use of custom pickling functions facilitates object serialization. No external data processing or command execution is involved. All components serve standard data modeling purposes without any suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured module for handling CSS selectors with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data flows.",
