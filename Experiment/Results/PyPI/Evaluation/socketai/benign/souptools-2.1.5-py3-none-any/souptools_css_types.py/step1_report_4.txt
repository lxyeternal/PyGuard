{
  "purpose": "The code defines data structures and classes for CSS selector representation and manipulation, including immutable data types, namespace handling, and custom selector definitions.",
  "sources": "Input data originates from instantiation parameters for classes such as Selector, SelectorTag, SelectorAttribute, SelectorContains, SelectorNth, SelectorLang, SelectorList, Namespaces, and CustomSelectors.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include any direct sinks such as network communication, file writing, or system modification; it primarily deals with in-memory data structures.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor inputs to internal immutable objects; there are no evident source-to-sink flows involving untrusted data affecting sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code lacks hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. It employs standard Python features for immutability and data handling without obfuscation or suspicious dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes immutable classes for CSS selector components and collections, emphasizing safety and hashability. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads. The import of 'copyreg' is used solely for object serialization support. The overall design suggests a focus on safe data modeling rather than malicious behavior. No network or system modification operations are present. No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors are detectable based on the provided code.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation of CSS selector data structures with a focus on immutability and serialization. There are no indications of malicious intent, sabotage, or supply chain attacks. The overall security risk is very low.",
