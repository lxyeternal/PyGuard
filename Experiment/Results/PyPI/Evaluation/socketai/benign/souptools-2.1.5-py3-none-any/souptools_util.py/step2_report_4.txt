  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** No suspicious or malicious behavior; purely utility functions for string manipulation, pattern context extraction, and warnings.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the benign assessment.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Comments:** The report's reasoning is sound. No issues, backdoors, or malicious intent detected.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with no malicious activity, just utility functions.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security concerns.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Comments:** The reasoning is consistent and well justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Again, utility functions with no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — correct.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Comments:** The analysis is thorough and justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Utility functions, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — slightly higher, but still within benign utility scope. Warnings can sometimes be misused if user-controlled messages are passed, but in this context, it appears standard.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Comments:** The reasoning is sound; warnings are a common pattern and not inherently malicious.\n\n**Verdict:** The securityRisk score is slightly elevated at 0.1, which is acceptable given the context. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Utility functions, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Comments:** Well reasoned.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is utility in nature, with no malicious behavior.\n- The malware scores are all 0, consistent with the benign analysis.\n- The security risk scores are mostly 0, with one at 0.1, which is reasonable given the warning functions, but still not indicative of malicious intent.\n- Obfuscation is correctly marked as 0 across all reports.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no signs of malicious code or payloads.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward and readable.\n\n**Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified; the only minor point is the warning functions, which are standard and not inherently risky.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. No adjustments needed. The code is a benign utility module with no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
