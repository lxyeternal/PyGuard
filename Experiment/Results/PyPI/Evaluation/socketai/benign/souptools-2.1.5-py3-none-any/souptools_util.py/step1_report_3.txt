  "purpose": "Utility functions for string manipulation, warning management, pattern context retrieval, and custom exception handling.",
  "sources": "Pattern matching using regex, input parameters for functions like pattern and index, and potentially user-invoked functions.",
  "sinks": "Warnings and exception messages, string processing for pattern context, and deprecated function calls.",
  "flows": "Pattern or string input is processed through regex or string iteration; warning functions may be triggered based on user calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. Usage of warnings for deprecation is standard; no hidden or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions: a string lowering function, a custom exception for CSS selector syntax errors, a deprecation warning decorator, a warning trigger, and a pattern context retriever. The pattern context function analyzes multi-line patterns for error reporting, not executing any untrusted code or performing dangerous operations. No external data sources, network activity, or data leaks are evident. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage, such as code injection or system manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be safe utility code focused on string processing, warning management, and error reporting. No malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks are evident.",
