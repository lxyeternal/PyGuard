  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code details, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is primarily utility functions: string manipulation (`lower`), pattern context extraction (`get_pattern_context`), deprecation warnings, and a custom exception class.\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, code injection, or dynamic code execution.\n- The functions do not process external user input directly in a way that would lead to vulnerabilities.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated/malicious code.\n- Warnings are standard Python warnings, used for deprecation notices.\n- The code appears safe, straightforward, and intended for internal utility purposes.\n\n---\n\n### **Report-by-Report Analysis**\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious behavior, benign utility functions.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — no evident risks.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — high certainty.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, with no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion; utility functions with no malicious intent.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct. Slightly less than perfect confidence, but justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher security risk score (0.1), possibly due to warnings potentially displaying untrusted messages if user input is passed into warning functions.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — this is marginal, perhaps overestimating the risk of warnings.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Justification:** The warnings themselves are standard; unless the message strings are derived from untrusted sources, this is not a real security risk. The score of 0.1 is somewhat cautious but not unreasonable, considering warnings could be misused if messages are untrusted.\n\n**Verdict:** Slightly conservative but acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to others, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious behavior is detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** All are 0 or very close, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Justification & Recommendations:**\n\n- The code is standard utility code with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- The only minor point is the warning functions, which could potentially be misused if message strings are untrusted. However, in the current form, they are safe.\n- The scores are consistent with the code analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk:** 0 — no security risks detected.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate. The code is benign utility code with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate, with a slight overcaution in report 4 regarding the warning message, but still acceptable.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the scores as they are, or set all risk scores to 0 for clarity.",
