  "purpose": "Utility functions for string manipulation, warnings, and pattern analysis, including deprecation warnings and pattern context retrieval.",
  "sources": "RE_PATTERN_LINE_SPLIT regex pattern, global variables, and the get_pattern_context function that reads the pattern string.",
  "sinks": "Warnings generated by deprecated() and warn_deprecated() functions, which could output to logs or stderr.",
  "flows": "Warning functions are called with message strings, potentially from untrusted sources if user input is passed into those functions.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not handle or process any external input directly; all inputs are parameters to functions. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily provides utility functions for string processing, warning issuance, and pattern context extraction. It includes a cached lowercase function, custom exception class, and warning decorators. No external input reading or untrusted data handling is visible; functions are straightforward and do not execute external code or handle sensitive data. Warning functions could potentially output untrusted messages, but this is standard behavior and not malicious. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or malware signatures are present. The code appears safe and intended for general utility purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain backdoors, malicious code, or suspicious network activity. Its functions are safe and serve common utility purposes.",
