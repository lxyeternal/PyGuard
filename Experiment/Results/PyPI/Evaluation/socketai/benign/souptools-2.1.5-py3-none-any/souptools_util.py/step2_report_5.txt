  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The code is a utility module involving string manipulation, regex pattern processing, and warnings.\n- No external network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection is observed.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code constructs are present.\n- The functions operate locally, with no evidence of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- The use of warnings and exceptions is standard and safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is benign, performing string operations and pattern context extraction.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — no security issues.\n- **Comments:** The reasoning is sound; no issues.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing utility functions and safe operations.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0 — consistent.\n- **Comments:** Accurate; no suspicious elements.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions, pattern analysis, and safe warning mechanisms.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.95 — the risk score seems high.\n- **Justification:** The report notes no malicious behavior but assigns a high risk score. Given the code's benign nature, this seems unreasonable.\n- **Recommendation:** Reduce the risk score to 0 or very low (e.g., 0.1). The functions do not perform any dangerous operations.\n\n**Verdict:** Adjust **securityRisk** from 0.95 to **0.1** for consistency.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions with no malicious behavior, standard warning usage.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.1 — appropriate.\n- **Comments:** Slightly higher risk score (0.1) might reflect cautiousness but is acceptable given the context.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0 — matches the benign assessment.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary of Adjustments:**\n\n- **Report 3:** **Reduce** `securityRisk` from **0.95** to **0.1** to align with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n## **Final Malware, Obfuscated, and Risk Scores:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk   |\n|---------|---------|--------------|--------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0      |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0      |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0.1    |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0.1    |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0      |\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard utility module with no signs of malicious behavior. The only adjustment needed is lowering the risk score in Report 3 to reflect its benign nature accurately.",
