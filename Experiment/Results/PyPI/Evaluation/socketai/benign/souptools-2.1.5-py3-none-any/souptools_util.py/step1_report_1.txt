  "purpose": "Utility functions and classes for string manipulation, pattern matching, and deprecation warnings.",
  "sources": "Constants, regex pattern compilation, functions that handle string operations, and class definitions.",
  "sinks": "Warnings issued via the warnings module, exception raising, and string processing.",
  "flows": "Input strings (such as patterns and indices) flow through functions like get_pattern_context and lower, affecting string formatting and warnings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors observed. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or system modifications are present. The code primarily performs string operations, regex matching, and warning emissions.",
  "analysis": "The code contains utility functions for string manipulation (e.g., lowercasing), regex pattern context extraction, and deprecation warnings. It uses standard Python libraries without any obfuscated or suspicious constructs. No data is sent over the network, and no system or sensitive data is accessed or stored. Exception handling is limited to a custom exception for CSS selector syntax errors, which is contextually safe. Warning functions are used to indicate deprecated features, which is a common practice. Overall, the code appears to serve legitimate utility purposes without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs string and pattern handling, as well as issuing deprecation warnings, all within normal bounds of utility code.",
