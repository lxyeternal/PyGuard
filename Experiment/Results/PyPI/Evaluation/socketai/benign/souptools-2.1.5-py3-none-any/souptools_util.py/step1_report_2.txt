  "purpose": "Utility functions for string manipulation, pattern parsing, and deprecation warnings.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions such as 'string', 'pattern', and 'index'.",
  "sinks": "Warnings generated by 'warnings.warn'. No data sinks identified for untrusted data manipulation.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through utility functions and warnings; no external network or system actions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code mainly provides utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines string utility functions, pattern context extraction, and deprecation warning mechanisms. It uses regex for pattern parsing and warnings for deprecation notices. No user input or external data is processed in a manner that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions. The functions operate locally without side effects or external communication. The code appears to be a standard utility module without signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It provides helpful functions for pattern analysis and warnings without any harmful actions or malicious payloads.",
