  "flows": "Input pattern or string -> get_pattern_context processing -> warnings or exception handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. No unsafe code or external network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions such as lowercasing with caching, custom exception for CSS selector syntax errors, and deprecation warnings. The get_pattern_context function processes a pattern string to generate context lines for error reporting, using regex for line splitting. No untrusted data sources, network activity, or code injection mechanisms are present. The warnings are standard deprecation warnings, and the exception class is for syntax errors. Overall, the code appears to be standard utility code with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of utility functions and classes for string and pattern handling, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and standard for utility purposes.",
