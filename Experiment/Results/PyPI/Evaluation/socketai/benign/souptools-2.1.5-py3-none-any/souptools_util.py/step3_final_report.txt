  "purpose": "Utility functions for string manipulation, pattern context extraction, and deprecation warnings.",
  "sources": "String inputs in functions like lower(), pattern and index in get_pattern_context(), warning message strings.",
  "sinks": "Warnings emitted via warnings.warn(), exception messages in SelectorSyntaxError.",
  "flows": "Input strings processed in lower() and get_pattern_context(), warning messages potentially triggered in warn_deprecated() and warn_deprecated().",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code; straightforward utility functions; no obfuscation or external data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of benign utility functions: a string lowercase converter, a custom exception for CSS selector syntax errors, functions for deprecation warnings, and a pattern context extractor. No network activity, data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious behavior is present. Warnings are standard and do not process untrusted data directly. The code is clear, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. The only minor concern is that warning messages could be misused if they contain untrusted input, but in this context, messages are static or controlled. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The only adjustment needed is in Report 3, where the security risk score should be lowered from 0.95 to 0.1 to better reflect the benign behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The existing assessments are accurate; only the risk score in Report 3 should be slightly lowered to align with the benign analysis.",
