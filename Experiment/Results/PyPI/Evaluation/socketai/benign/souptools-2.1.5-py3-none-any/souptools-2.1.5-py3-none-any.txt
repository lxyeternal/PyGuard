      "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function for formatting the string output of a SoupSieve object, with no malicious intent or security risks. The regex-based parsing is straightforward and safe, and the function does not perform any external operations or handle untrusted data beyond string formatting. All evidence supports a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1)."

      "obfuscated": 0.2,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is a standard CSS selector parser with some suspicious coding practices, notably the assignment of 'exec' and 'eval' to variables that could be invoked maliciously. The static network fetch is not used but could be exploited if manipulated. No active malware or malicious behavior is evident in this fragment. The overall risk is low but warrants caution due to the insecure function aliasing practices."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, focusing on data modeling for CSS selectors. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with the slight elevation in security risk being justified and minimal. Overall, the supply chain security risk is effectively negligible."
