  "purpose": "Convert a FabricDataFrame to a GeoDataFrame with geometry points based on latitude and longitude columns.",
  "sources": "Reading the columns 'lat_col' and 'long_col' from the FabricDataFrame, importing 'geopandas' within the function.",
  "sinks": "Creating a GeoDataFrame with geometry derived from coordinate columns; no data leaks or external effects are evident.",
  "flows": "Input dataframe -> extract coordinate columns -> generate geometry points -> return GeoDataFrame.",
  "anomalies": "The import of 'geopandas' occurs inside the function, which is normal; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a function to convert a custom DataFrame into a GeoDataFrame, creating geometry from specified coordinate columns. The import of 'geopandas' is local, which is acceptable. No suspicious or malicious logic, external network activity, or backdoors are present. The function performs a straightforward transformation without any unusual code constructs or obfuscation. The code is well-structured, with proper type annotations and docstrings. There are no signs of malware, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard data transformation task with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is safe to use within the expected context.",
