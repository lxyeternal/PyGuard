{
  "purpose": "Convert a FabricDataFrame to a GeoDataFrame with geometry points based on latitude and longitude columns.",
  "sources": "Imports from sempy modules, especially functions, fabric, matcher, and geopandas; access to df[long_col] and df[lat_col]",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no untrusted data sinks such as network, file, or system commands are present",
  "flows": "Input DataFrame flows through the function, with column references used to create geometry; no external untrusted data flow observed",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions and classes, defines a function to convert a DataFrame into a GeoDataFrame, and utilizes geopandas to generate spatial points. The function relies on standard libraries and well-known modules; no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious code injection are present. The code is straightforward, focusing on data transformation without external network or system interference.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate data transformation utility for geospatial analysis without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. No security risks or malware indications are detected.",
