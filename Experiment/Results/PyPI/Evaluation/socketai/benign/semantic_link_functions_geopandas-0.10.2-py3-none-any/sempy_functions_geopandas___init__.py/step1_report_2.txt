  "purpose": "Export the 'to_geopandas' function from the 'semphy_functions_geopandas._geopandas' module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'to_geopandas' from a specific module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data output.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports a function and defines an export list.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a single function from a presumably internal or third-party module and defines an export list for it. There are no inputs, outputs, or data flows that could be exploited. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code is clean, simple, and adheres to standard Python practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module import and export declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate.",
