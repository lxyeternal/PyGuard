  "purpose": "Re-export the 'to_geopandas' function from an internal module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'sempy_functions_geopandas._geopandas'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external communication or data processing.",
  "flows": "Import from internal module to module's namespace; no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import and export, no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function from an internal module and exposes it via __all__, serving as a re-export. No data flows, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. The code is minimal, standard, and free of obfuscation or malicious elements. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward module re-export with no malicious or security concerns. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain as is.",
