{
  "purpose": "Exports the 'to_geopandas' function from the 'sempy_functions_geopandas._geopandas' module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'to_geopandas' from an internal module; '__all__' declaration specifying exported symbols.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows involving untrusted data; no data processing or I/O operations present.",
  "flows": "None; the code only performs a module import and sets export symbols.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and does not contain obfuscated elements or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific function from an internal module and defines what symbols are exported from this module. There are no signs of malicious code, hidden behaviors, or data exfiltration. The absence of data processing, external network communication, or secret handling suggests a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple module import and export declaration with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears safe and typical for Python package modules.",
