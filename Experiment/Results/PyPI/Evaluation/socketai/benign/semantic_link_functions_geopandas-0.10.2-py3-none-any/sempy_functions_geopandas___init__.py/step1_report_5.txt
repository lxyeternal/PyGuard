  "purpose": "The code exports a function 'to_geopandas' from the 'sempy_functions_geopandas._geopandas' module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'to_geopandas' from a third-party or internal module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or potentially harmful code execution points.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs a module import and an export declaration.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears minimal and standard; no suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple import and export statement with no processing logic, data handling, or user input. It relies on external module 'sempy_functions_geopandas._geopandas'. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. Its purpose seems to be exposing the 'to_geopandas' function for use elsewhere.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and lacks any malicious intent or security issues. It merely re-exports a function from an internal module. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified.",
