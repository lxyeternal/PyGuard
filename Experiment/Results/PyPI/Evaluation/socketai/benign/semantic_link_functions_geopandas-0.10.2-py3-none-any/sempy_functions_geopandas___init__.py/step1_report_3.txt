  "sources": "Import statement importing 'to_geopandas' from a submodule.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points; no sinks indicating data leaks or malicious behavior.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only performs an import and defines an export list.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or unusual code constructs. The import path appears standard for a Python package.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific function from a local or package submodule, then defines an export list containing that function. There are no indications of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks. The code is minimal and straightforward, serving a typical package export purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module import and export definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It is safe based on the provided snippet.",
