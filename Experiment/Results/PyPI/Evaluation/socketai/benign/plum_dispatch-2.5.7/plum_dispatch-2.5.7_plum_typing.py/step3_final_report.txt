  "purpose": "Provides compatibility for type hint functions across different Python versions by conditionally importing from 'typing_extensions' or 'typing'.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info used to determine Python version for conditional imports.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, external communication, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Version check leads to import from either 'typing_extensions' or 'typing', with no data flow beyond imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a straightforward compatibility shim with clear logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple version check to import type hint functions from the appropriate module, ensuring compatibility across Python versions. It does not process untrusted data, perform I/O, or execute any malicious actions. The logic is standard, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. All signals indicate benign intent, and the scores reflect this with zero malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard compatibility utility with no malicious or security concerns. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with its functionality.",
