{
  "purpose": "The code defines compatibility shims for Python's typing features based on the Python version in use, importing appropriate functions from either 'typing_extensions' or 'typing'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Python version information from 'sys.version_info'. It imports modules 'typing_extensions' or 'typing' based on the version check.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that process untrusted data or perform operations that could lead to data leaks or security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "The flow is from reading 'sys.version_info' to conditional imports of modules and assignment of functions and variables, with no untrusted data passing into sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code appears straightforward, with proper version-based imports for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing 'sys' and setting '__all__' for export. It then checks the Python version to decide whether to import functions from 'typing_extensions' (for Python versions below 3.9) or from 'typing' (for Python 3.9 and above). No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are used. No dynamic execution or other suspicious constructs are present. The code's purpose is to ensure compatibility across Python versions for type hinting utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for compatibility handling of typing features across Python versions. It does not perform any data processing, network operations, or security-sensitive actions. There is no indication of malicious intent or security risk.",
