  "review": "Let's analyze each report systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issue presence:** The code matches the description—conditional imports based on Python version for type hint functions.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No errors or logical flaws.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. These are reasonable given the benign nature.  \n- **Justification:** The code performs straightforward compatibility imports with no malicious or obfuscated elements.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid assessment.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issue presence:** The code is identical in purpose—compatibility imports based on Python version.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues detected.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, no external data handling.  \n- **Conclusion:** Correct.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as above—compatibility shim for typing functions.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No flaws or anomalies.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Justification:** Clear, straightforward, standard practice for version compatibility.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issue presence:** The code matches the description—version check and conditional imports.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No suspicious behavior or anomalies.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, no external data processing.  \n- **Conclusion:** Correct.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same purpose—compatibility for type hints across Python versions.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues found.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Justification:** The code is standard, benign, and intended for compatibility.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify the code as benign with no malicious intent. I agree with a malware score of **0** across all reports.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** The code is straightforward and transparent; no obfuscation is present. I concur with **0**.  \n- **Risk score:** The code performs simple conditional imports for compatibility, with no external data, no I/O, no security-sensitive operations. The risk score should be **0** for all reports.\n\n### Final estimation:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0  \n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is a standard compatibility shim with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
