{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to import and set up type hinting functions based on the Python version, providing compatibility with different Python versions for type hints and annotations.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, typing_extensions, typing modules",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "sys.version_info check → conditional import of modules → assignment of functions and variables",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally imports functions from either typing_extensions or typing modules depending on the Python version. It assigns specific functions (get_type_hints, get_origin, get_args, Annotated) for later use. The code is straightforward, with clear version checks and imports, and does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or execute any untrusted input. There are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a compatibility shim for Python type hinting functions, with no malicious intent, security risks, or anomalies. It simply manages imports based on Python version for proper type hint support.",
