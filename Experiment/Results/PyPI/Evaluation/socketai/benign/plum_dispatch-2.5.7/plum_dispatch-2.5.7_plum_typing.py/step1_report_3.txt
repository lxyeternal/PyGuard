{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to import and assign specific typing functions from either 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' modules based on the Python version. It ensures compatibility across different Python versions by selecting the appropriate source for these functions.",
  "sources": "Reads the Python version info from 'sys.version_info' and imports modules 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' depending on the version.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that process untrusted input or data.",
  "flows": "The code reads Python version info, then conditionally imports modules and assigns functions accordingly. No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The conditional import logic is standard for compatibility handling.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing 'sys' to check Python version. It defines a list '__all__' for export. Depending on the Python version, it conditionally imports 'typing_extensions' or 'typing' modules. It assigns specific type hinting functions ('get_type_hints', 'get_origin', 'get_args') and 'Annotated' accordingly. This pattern is common for maintaining backward compatibility across Python versions. No external inputs are processed, and no dangerous operations are performed. The code does not include network activity, file I/O, or any other potentially malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility shim for Python type hinting modules. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues. It is safe and appears to be purposeful for cross-version compatibility.",
