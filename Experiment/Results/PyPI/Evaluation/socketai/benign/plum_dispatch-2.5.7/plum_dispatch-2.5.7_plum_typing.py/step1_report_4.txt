{
  "purpose": "The code provides compatibility functions for Python's type hinting features across different Python versions, specifically handling imports from `typing_extensions` for versions earlier than 3.9 and from `typing` for 3.9 and above.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Python version via `sys.version_info` to determine which modules to import.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could cause security issues. The code only performs import operations based on version checks.",
  "flows": "The flow depends on the Python version: if earlier than 3.9, it imports from `typing_extensions`; otherwise, it imports from `typing`. No untrusted data flow is present.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward and intended for compatibility purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a version check and imports appropriate modules to ensure compatibility with different Python versions for type hinting features. It uses standard import statements and conditionals. There are no external data inputs, no data leaks, or malicious behaviors. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious logic are present. The structure is clear and standard for compatibility code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign compatibility utility for handling Python version differences when importing typing-related functions and classes. No malicious activity or security risks are detected.",
