{
  "purpose": "To provide compatibility for type hint functions across different Python versions by importing them from appropriate modules.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Python version info from sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any I/O or external communication.",
  "flows": "The version check flows determine which module to import functions from based on the Python version.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior detected. The code uses straightforward conditional imports for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports specific functions from either 'typing_extensions' or 'typing' based on the Python version, which is standard practice for compatibility. No user input handling, data leaks, or suspicious behavior observed. The code's logic is clear and aimed at maintaining compatibility for type hints, with no obfuscated or malicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard compatibility shim for Python type hint functions, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
