  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a utility for method resolution, error handling, and documentation, using standard and internal modules.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows into error classes, documentation, and resolution functions. No suspicious activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation. Dynamic function renaming and wrapping are transparent and for legitimate purposes.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, benign code for method management with no malicious indicators.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0, 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (very low, primarily because of dynamic function handling, which is standard in such frameworks).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar in scope—method resolution, documentation, error reporting.\n- Potential data leakage through documentation generation if functions are maliciously crafted, but no actual malicious activity.\n- No obfuscation, network activity, or backdoors.\n- Overall, standard framework code.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0, 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on signature resolution, error classes, and documentation.\n- No suspicious network, file, or code injection activities.\n- Uses standard practices; no obfuscation.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0, 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (still very low, mostly due to dynamic function handling).\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Utility functions and classes for method signatures, error handling, and documentation.\n- No malicious behavior; standard use of rich, pydoc, and warnings.\n- No obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0, 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar utility for method management, with no suspicious external activity.\n- No code injection, network, or data exfiltration.\n- Uses dynamic function renaming and wrapping for documentation, which is legitimate.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0, 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently indicate no malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors. The malware score should be **0**.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; code is clear and well-structured. Obfuscated score should be **0**.\n- **Risk Score:** The overall security risk is minimal, given the nature of the code. The highest provided is 0.2, which is acceptable for such utility code.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** **0.1 to 0.2** (very low, standard utility code)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility module for method resolution, error reporting, and documentation generation. It contains no indicators of malware, obfuscation, or supply chain sabotage. The low risk scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports collectively confirm the benign nature of the code.\n- No changes needed to the provided scores.\n- The overall security posture is very good; no malicious or obfuscation concerns.",
