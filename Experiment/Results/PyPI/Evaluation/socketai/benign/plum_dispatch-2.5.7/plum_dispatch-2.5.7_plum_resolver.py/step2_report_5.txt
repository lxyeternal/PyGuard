  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core logic, potential security implications, and consistency of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes classes/functions for method resolution, error handling, and documentation. Uses internal modules, external libraries ('rich', 'pydoc'), and standard modules ('sys', 'warnings').\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows into resolution, error reporting, and documentation functions. No external system calls or data leaks are indicated.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation. Function wrapping and documentation generation are standard practices. Error classes produce rich console output for debugging, not malicious activity.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code appears legitimate with a high confidence (0.9). Malware score is 0, security risk is 0.1 (very low).\n\n**Assessment:** The logic is straightforward, and no malicious patterns are evident. The scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on method resolution, documentation, and error handling. Uses 'rich', 'sys', and internal modules.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No network or file system activity; mainly string rendering and exception raising.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, obfuscated patterns, or secrets. Potential concern if untrusted functions are passed into _document or _change_function_name, but this is standard and not malicious.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Also high confidence (0.9), malware score 0, risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** The logic is benign, serving documentation and error reporting functions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focused on signature resolution, error handling, and documentation. Uses standard modules and external libraries.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No unsafe operations; mainly string formatting, warnings, and exceptions.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns or obfuscation. Use of 'warnings' and 'rich' is standard.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Similar high confidence, malware 0, risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious activity detected; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Method resolution, error reporting, documentation. Uses 'rich', 'sys', and internal modules.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Generates console output, manipulates function objects, no system modifications.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code. Functions for renaming and documentation are standard utilities.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence, malware 0, risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Functionality appears legitimate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for method signatures, error handling, and documentation. Uses standard and external libraries.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** String rendering, function wrapping, no system calls.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns. Use of dynamic renaming and documentation is controlled.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence, malware 0, risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, consistent with the analysis. No suspicious network, file, or code injection activity detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, indicating code clarity and lack of obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly higher (0.1-0.2), reflecting the dynamic function renaming and wrapping, which could be misused in untrusted contexts but are standard in such utility code.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\nGiven the detailed review, I would assign the following scores:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — minimal, mainly due to dynamic function renaming/wrapping, which is standard but could be misused if inputs are untrusted.\n\n**Note:** The overall code appears to be a legitimate part of a method resolution and documentation system, with no signs of supply chain compromise or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Estimated Value |\n|----------------|-----------------|\n| Malware        | 0               |\n| Obfuscated     | 0               |\n| Risk           | 0.1             |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
