{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes and functions for method resolution, error handling, and documentation generation within a dynamic method management framework.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from method signatures, function objects, and target signatures; generates console output for errors and documentation.",
  "sinks": "Outputs rich text to console, raises exceptions, and manipulates function objects for renaming and wrapping.",
  "flows": "Source data (signatures, functions) flows into resolution checks, error classes, and documentation functions; results in console output or exception raising.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Use of dynamic renaming and wrapping is standard for introspection and documentation purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code is a utility module for method signature resolution, error reporting, and documentation. It employs standard libraries and internal modules without network activity or data leaks. Error classes produce rich console output, aiding debugging but not malicious. Dynamic function renaming and wrapping are transparent and typical in such frameworks. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The code's operations are safe and intended for internal use. Scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for method resolution, error handling, and documentation, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage. The scores are appropriate and justified.",
