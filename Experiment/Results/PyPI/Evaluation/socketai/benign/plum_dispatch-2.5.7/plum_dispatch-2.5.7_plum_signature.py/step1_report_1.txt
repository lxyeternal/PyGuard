{
  "purpose": "Defines a Signature class for representing function call signatures and utility functions for extracting and manipulating such signatures, primarily for dispatch and type resolution.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function signatures, annotations, and default parameter values; reads attributes from functions such as __annotations__ and parameters.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no code writes untrusted data to external systems or performs risky operations like network access, file modifications, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Extracts function signatures -> processes annotations -> constructs Signature objects -> manipulates signatures for default arguments.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; code involves signature processing, but no unusual or suspicious code behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured implementation for handling function signatures, extracting type hints, and manipulating signature objects for dispatch purposes. It utilizes type hint resolution, supports PEP 563 annotations, and handles variable argument expansion and comparison. No suspicious code, such as network access, data exfiltration, or backdoors, is detected. The code only performs type analysis and signature handling, which are standard for such libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, purpose-built module for signature handling, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It relies on external libraries for type resolution and only manipulates function metadata.",
