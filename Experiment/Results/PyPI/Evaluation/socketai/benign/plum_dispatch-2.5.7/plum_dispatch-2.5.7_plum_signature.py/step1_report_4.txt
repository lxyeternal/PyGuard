{
  "purpose": "This code provides a class and utility functions for representing, analyzing, and manipulating function call signatures, particularly for dispatching purposes in a Python library or framework.",
  "sources": "Reads data from function annotations, inspect.signature parameters, and default argument values. Also reads attributes of functions and callables for signature extraction.",
  "sinks": "Uses data from function annotations, default values, and call signatures for internal processing, but does not directly write to files, send data over network, or execute code dynamically based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Extracts annotations and signature details from functions -> constructs Signature objects -> performs comparisons, expansions, matching, and signature transformations -> uses these for dispatch logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. No obfuscated code patterns or malicious dynamic execution mechanisms are detected. The code involves standard Python reflection, signature handling, and type resolution functions without any evident malicious payload.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Signature class to model function signatures, including types, variadic arguments, and precedence, with methods for creation from callables, comparison, matching, and expansion. It imports standard libraries and some internal modules related to type resolution and utility functions. The functions inspect_signature, resolve_pep563, and _extract_signature use Python's inspect module and type hint resolution to process callable objects. The append_default_args function manipulates signatures to account for default arguments, aiding in dispatch decision-making. The code relies on safe, standard Python reflection, type hints, and string representations without executing or transmitting untrusted data. There are no signs of malicious behaviors such as code injection, network activity, or credential theft. The code appears to be a well-structured, utility-focused implementation for signature handling, with no malicious intent or dangerous behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign, utility-oriented module for signature analysis and manipulation, with no evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It performs reflection and type handling securely and responsibly. The overall security risk score is low.",
