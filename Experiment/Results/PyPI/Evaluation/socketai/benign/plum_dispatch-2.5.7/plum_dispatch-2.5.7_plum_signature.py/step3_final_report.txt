  "purpose": "Object representing a call signature that may be used to dispatch a function call, focusing on types, varargs, and precedence for dispatch logic.",
  "sources": "Function annotations, default parameter values, inspect.signature parameters",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; primarily signature extraction, comparison, and type resolution",
  "flows": "Extraction of annotations -> creation of Signature objects -> comparison and expansion of signature types",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic mutation of function annotations via resolve_pep563; no malicious activity but notable for signature mutation",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Signature class for representing function signatures with type hints, varargs, and precedence. It includes methods for constructing signatures from callables, comparing signatures, expanding varargs, and matching values. The code uses standard Python modules (inspect, operator, sys) and third-party modules (beartype, rich). The dynamic mutation of annotations in resolve_pep563 is typical in signature resolution but could be misused if misapplied. No network, file, or secret handling is present. The code appears to be a utility for dispatch or type checking, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for function signature handling, comparison, and expansion. No malicious, backdoor, or obfuscated behavior is evident. The slight dynamic annotation mutation is standard in signature resolution systems and does not indicate malicious intent.",
