{
  "purpose": "Define and manipulate a simplified call signature object for dispatch purposes, including extracting signatures from callables and handling signature comparison.",
  "sources": "Import statements (inspect, sys, operator, copy, typing), attribute access (e.g., __annotations__, __signature__), function parameters, class attributes, type hints, annotations, default values.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to __annotations__, potentially untrusted annotations, default parameter values, signature construction and comparison, mutable operations on function objects.",
  "flows": "Signature extraction from callables → resolving annotations and PEP563 → constructing Signature objects → signature comparison and matching → appending default arguments → type resolution → mutating function annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activities are present. The code appears to perform routine signature analysis and manipulation, with some dynamic inspection and signature construction. No unusual obfuscated language features or suspicious code patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily focuses on extracting, representing, and manipulating function signatures for dispatching purposes. It employs dynamic inspection of functions, annotations, and default parameters. The code uses type resolution and annotation mutation in `resolve_pep563`, which could potentially modify function annotations. The signature comparison logic involves type hierarchy checks. No code indicates malicious intent such as network activity, file modification, or covert backdoors. Import statements are standard, with some optional compatibility imports. The code’s logic for signature matching and expansion appears legitimate and standard for dispatch systems.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a utility module for signature analysis and dispatching, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It does perform dynamic mutation of function annotations, which is typical in signature handling but should be used carefully. Overall, the code does not exhibit malicious intent, backdoors, or security exploits.",
