{
  "purpose": "This code provides a class and functions for handling function call signatures, including extracting, comparing, and manipulating signatures for dispatch purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads from function annotations, function signatures, and default parameters; accesses sys.version_info for version-dependent imports.",
  "sinks": "Uses inspect.signature to analyze function parameters; no direct sinks for untrusted data are identified.",
  "flows": "Extracts annotations and signatures from functions, compares signature types, and expands or matches signatures based on runtime data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. Usage of dynamic type resolution and signature manipulation appears standard. No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or privacy violations detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Signature class for representing function call signatures, supporting comparison, expansion, and matching operations. It dynamically resolves type annotations, including support for PEP563 annotations. Functions extract signatures from callables, handle default arguments, and enable signature comparison and expansion, all using standard Python features. No suspicious behavior or malicious patterns are identified; the code primarily focuses on signature analysis and manipulation for dispatch mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a legitimate utility for signature handling and dispatch logic, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It utilizes standard library functions and third-party modules in a typical manner. No malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or security risks are detected based on the code provided.",
