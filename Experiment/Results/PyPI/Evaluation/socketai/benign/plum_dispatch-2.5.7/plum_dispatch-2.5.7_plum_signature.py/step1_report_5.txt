{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Signature class for representing function call signatures and utility functions for extracting and manipulating signatures, mainly for dispatching and type checking.",
  "sources": "Code reads input from function call signatures, function annotations, and default parameter values via inspect.signature, get_type_hints, and function parameters.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or external systems are present. No data leaks, system commands, or network activity are evident.",
  "flows": "Type hints and annotations are extracted from functions, then used for type comparisons, matching, and signature expansion. No data flows into external systems or untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are observed. The code structure is standard and well-organized. No suspicious obfuscation or uncommon language features are detected. The use of the beartype library is for type resolution, not malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured implementation of a signature object for function dispatching with associated utility functions. It utilizes standard libraries like inspect, operator, sys, and third-party libraries for type handling. No suspicious behavior, external communications, or potential malicious constructs are present. All code appears to serve legitimate purposes such as signature extraction, type resolution, and signature comparison. The code does not perform any file or network I/O, nor does it include any obfuscated or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate utility for handling function signatures and dispatch logic. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks based on the provided fragment.",
