  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious behavior, code logic, and the consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, importing modules and defining type utility functions. No suspicious behavior, no obfuscated code, no external data leaks, and no network or file operations.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the benign assessment.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — justified, as no security risks are evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — high confidence in benign nature.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, with no suspicious behaviors, no external data handling, and standard use of libraries.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0, obfuscated 0 — all appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — high confidence.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Slightly more cautious, noting the use of `partial` and dynamic type hint resolution but concluding these are benign. Slightly higher security risk score (0.1) possibly due to the dynamic configuration.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent with benign analysis.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — slightly elevated but justifiable, considering dynamic configuration might be misused in malicious contexts, but no evidence here.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95 — high but slightly less than perfect, reflecting cautiousness.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable, but the risk score could be slightly higher if considering the dynamic configuration as a potential attack vector, but in this context, it remains justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the benign nature, with attention to the use of `import *`.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0.1, obfuscated 0 — consistent.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — slightly less due to the `import *` concern, which could hide malicious imports, but no evidence of malicious code.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable, but the risk score might be marginally increased if considering the potential dangers of `import *`.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Recognizes the benign purpose but highlights the use of `import *` as a potential concern.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0.2, obfuscated 0 — the elevated risk score reflects the concern about `import *`.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — cautious but justified.\n\n**Verdict:** The elevated risk score is justified due to the `import *` statement, which could conceal malicious imports, even if none are present here.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary and Final Judgment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, and there's no evidence of malicious behavior in the code snippet.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Mostly 0 or 0.1, with one report at 0.2 due to `import *`. Given the benign nature of the code, these are reasonable, but the `import *` warrants a slight increase in risk perception.\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — primarily due to the use of `import *`, which can obscure imports and potentially hide malicious code, but in this context, it’s standard in library code and not inherently malicious.\n\n**Final notes:** The code is a typical utility module for type checking, with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain attack vectors. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and the cautious approach regarding `import *` is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Estimate |\n|-----------------|----------------|\n| Malware         | 0              |\n| Obfuscated      | 0              |\n| Security Risk   | 0.1            |\n\nThis assessment aligns with the detailed reviews and the nature of the code.",
