{
  "purpose": "Provides type validation functions `isinstance` and `issubclass` supporting type hints, wrapping internal beartype utilities for enhanced type checking.",
  "sources": "Imports from beartype library, internal modules, and standard typing modules; uses `partial` and `resolve_type_hint` functions.",
  "sinks": "No external data input/output, network activity, or system modifications detected.",
  "flows": "Type hint resolution flows into `_is_bearable` and `_TypeHint` comparisons within `isinstance` and `issubclass` functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of `import *` statements and `partial` configuration; no suspicious code or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign utility for type validation, wrapping internal beartype functions. It imports modules, defines wrapper functions, and sets configuration for type checking strategies. No external data handling, network activity, or malicious code is present. The use of `import *` and `partial` are standard in such utility modules but could be minor concerns in supply chain contexts. Overall, the code is straightforward, well-structured, and aligns with typical type utility patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign type validation utility with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to `import *` usage, which is common in library code but warrants cautious review in supply chain scenarios. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is approximately 0.1, reflecting minor concerns but no actual threats.",
