  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign type validation utility with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to `import *` usage, which is common in library code but warrants cautious review in supply chain scenarios. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is approximately 0.1, reflecting minor concerns but no actual threats."
