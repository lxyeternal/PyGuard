{
  "purpose": "This module monkey patches the __repr__ and __str__ methods of the typing.Union class to control how Union types are displayed, allowing aliasing of union types for clearer printing.",
  "sources": "Code imports get_args from a local module, uses type hints, and patches built-in type methods; no external data inputs are read.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or external output are present; no network, file, or environment variable interactions observed.",
  "flows": "The patched __repr__ and __str__ methods modify the output of Union types in printing; set_union_alias modifies how unions are represented in the alias list.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior. The code manipulates internal type representations, which is expected given its purpose. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code redefines __repr__ and __str__ methods for typing.Union to enable custom aliasing for better readability of union types. It maintains a list of aliases and modifies how unions are printed based on these aliases. The code avoids altering core Python internals beyond the Union type and does not execute external code or system commands. It uses standard Python techniques like monkey patching and list management. There are no indications of malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or malicious side effects. The code's logic is self-contained, aiming solely at enhancing debugging or printing behavior without external interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to customize the display of Union types via monkey patching, which is a controlled modification of type behavior. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or malware. Its purpose appears to be solely to improve the developer experience when inspecting union types. Overall security risk is very low.",
