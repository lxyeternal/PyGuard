{
  "purpose": "The module monkey patches the __repr__ and __str__ methods of the typing.Union class to control how Union types are displayed, allowing aliasing and custom representations.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the imported get_args function, the type objects of Union, and the internal list _ALIASED_UNIONS. It also receives input via the set_union_alias function when aliases are set.",
  "sinks": "The code modifies methods (__repr__, __str__) of the Union type, affecting how Union objects are represented as strings. No external data sinks (like network, files, or environment variables) are directly involved.",
  "flows": "The code intercepts calls to Union's __repr__ and __str__, redirecting them to custom functions that generate string representations based on internal alias mappings stored in _ALIASED_UNIONS.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses internal and private attributes of the typing module (_type_repr), monkey patches built-in class methods, and manipulates internal lists without validation. No malicious backdoors or suspicious logic detected. No hardcoded credentials or privacy violations observed.",
  "analysis": "The script modifies the representation methods of the typing.Union class to support aliasing. It uses internal type attributes and a list _ALIASED_UNIONS to track alias mappings. The core logic involves replacing __repr__ and __str__ methods, which is a controlled and deliberate behavior, not malicious. The use of private attributes and functions appears to serve the purpose of customizing string outputs. There are no signs of data exfiltration, remote control, or harmful operations. The code could potentially be misused to produce misleading representations if used maliciously, but this is an intended feature rather than malicious code. No external network or system calls are present, and no sensitive data is accessed or transmitted.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to customize how Union types are displayed via monkey patching, with no evidence of malicious intent. It is a specialized utility for type representation customization. There are no malicious behaviors or supply chain security threats detected.",
