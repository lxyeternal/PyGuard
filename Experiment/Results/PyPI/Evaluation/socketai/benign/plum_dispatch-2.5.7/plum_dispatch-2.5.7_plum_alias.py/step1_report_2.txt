{
  "purpose": "The module monkey patches the __repr__ and __str__ methods of typing.Union to control how unions are displayed, allowing aliasing for better readability.",
  "sources": "Imports from functools, typing, and a local module .typing; usage of get_args; access to type(Union[int, float])",
  "sinks": "None explicitly evident; no data is sent over network, written to files, or executed dynamically",
  "flows": "The patched __repr__ and __str__ methods generate custom string representations based on stored aliases; set_union_alias updates alias mappings",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code or misleading language features; the code performs straightforward monkey patching and alias management without hidden behaviors",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to monkey patch the __repr__ and __str__ methods of the built-in Union type, enabling customized display of Union types with user-defined aliases. It maintains a list of alias mappings and provides functions to activate and deactivate these patches. The get_args function is imported from a local module, likely to extract union arguments. The main logic involves identifying contained unions, managing alias insertions, and generating string representations that incorporate aliases. No network, file I/O, or dynamic code execution is present. The code appears to be designed solely for improving readability of union types in logs or debugging output, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for customizing how typing.Union types are displayed, involving straightforward monkey patching and alias management. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It does not perform any data exfiltration, code injection, or harmful actions.",
