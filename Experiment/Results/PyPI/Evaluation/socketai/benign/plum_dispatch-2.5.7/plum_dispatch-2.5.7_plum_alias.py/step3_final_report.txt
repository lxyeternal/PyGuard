{
  "purpose": "This module monkey patches `__repr__` and `__str__` of `typing.Union` to control how `typing.Union` types are displayed, allowing aliasing for improved readability during debugging and development.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the internal `Union` type and the `get_args` function, and manipulates the `__repr__` and `__str__` methods of the `typing.Union` type.",
  "sinks": "The code modifies the string representation methods of `typing.Union`, affecting how union types are displayed, but does not involve external data sinks or data leaks.",
  "flows": "The source is the `Union` type and `get_args`; the flow involves calling the patched `__repr__` or `__str__` methods to generate custom string outputs.",
  "anomalies": "Monkey patching core typing internals and internal attribute access (`_type_repr`) are unconventional but not malicious; no obfuscation or malicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code's purpose is cosmetic, enhancing the readability of `typing.Union` types via monkey patching. It maintains an internal list `_ALIASED_UNIONS` to track alias mappings. No external data, network activity, or code injection occurs. The use of local `get_args` is benign assuming it is a standard utility. The monkey patching affects only string representations and does not execute untrusted code. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned across reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1–0.2) are consistent with the benign, cosmetic nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a controlled utility for aliasing and customizing the display of `typing.Union` types. It involves monkey patching core type methods but does not perform any malicious or harmful actions. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is correctly set to 0. The overall assessment confirms the code's benign intent and safe usage.",
