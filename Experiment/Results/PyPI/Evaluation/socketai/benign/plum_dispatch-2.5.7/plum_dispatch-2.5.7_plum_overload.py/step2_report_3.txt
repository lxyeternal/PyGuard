  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Functionality & Purpose**:\n   - The code conditionally imports `get_overloads` and `overload` from either `typing` (for Python >= 3.11) or `typing_extensions` (for earlier versions). \n   - This is a common compatibility pattern to ensure the correct functions are imported depending on the Python runtime version.\n   - The `__all__` list exposes these functions for external use.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues or Anomalies**:\n   - The code is straightforward and does not process untrusted data, execute external commands, or contain any data sinks.\n   - The only noted anomalies are the comments related to test coverage directives (`# pragma: specific no cover ...`). These are likely related to test coverage tools and not malicious.\n   - No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present.\n\n3. **Security & Malicious Behavior**:\n   - No evidence of malware, malicious intent, or suspicious activity.\n   - The version check logic is correct and standard.\n   - No external data is fetched or executed, and no dynamic code execution is present.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — The code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk Score**: 0 — The code is a benign compatibility utility with no security implications.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - The reports uniformly agree that this is a standard pattern for handling compatibility across Python versions.\n   - No claims or evidence suggest any vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment**:\n- The code is a benign, standard compatibility shim.\n- No issues, vulnerabilities, or malware are present.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and reasonable.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThis code snippet is safe, straightforward, and serves a compatibility purpose without any security concerns.",
