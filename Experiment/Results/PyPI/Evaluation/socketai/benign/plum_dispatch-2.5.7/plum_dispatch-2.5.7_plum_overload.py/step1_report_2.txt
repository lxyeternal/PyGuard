{
  "purpose": "The code manages compatibility for importing 'get_overloads' and 'overload' from different typing modules based on Python version.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, the 'sys' module for version info; import statements for 'typing' or 'typing_extensions'.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data handling or output that could lead to data leak or execution.",
  "flows": "Reads Python version info from sys; imports from specified modules based on version; exposes selected functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code checks the Python runtime version to conditionally import functions from appropriate modules, ensuring compatibility. It uses sys.version_info for version detection and conditionally imports 'get_overloads' and 'overload' from either 'typing' or 'typing_extensions'. The use of version checks appears straightforward and standard. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious flows are present. The code is minimal, clear, and purpose-driven.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version compatibility shim for importing typing utilities, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and intended solely for compatibility purposes.",
