  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward compatibility utility for importing typing functions based on Python version.\n- The code uses `sys.version_info` to determine whether to import from `typing` or `typing_extensions`.\n- No report mentions any suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data handling.\n- The code appears minimal, standard, and purpose-driven.\n\n**Confirming Issues in the Code:**\n- The code matches the description; it correctly performs version checks and imports accordingly.\n- No anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code, are detected.\n- The comments about `# pragma: specific no cover ...` are related to test coverage directives, not malicious intent.\n\n**Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n- No logical errors or reasoning flaws are evident.\n- The comments about test coverage directives are noted but not problematic.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n- The confidence levels are 1, indicating high certainty.\n- The purpose and analysis are consistent and correct.\n\n**Potential for Malicious Behavior:**\n- No evidence suggests malicious intent.\n- The code does not process untrusted data, execute external commands, or contain obfuscated logic.\n- The import pattern is standard for maintaining compatibility.\n\n**Conclusion and Personal Assessment:**\n- The code is a benign, standard compatibility shim.\n- No security risks or malware are present.\n- The test coverage comments are unrelated to security concerns.\n\n**Final Scores:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThese align with the detailed analysis and the reports' conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a simple, safe compatibility utility with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The reported scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
