{
  "purpose": "This code handles importing specific functions from the 'typing' module or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version, likely for type hinting purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Python version info from 'sys.version_info'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; it does not process untrusted data or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: 'sys.version_info' is checked, then the appropriate imports are made accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains an inconsistent comment '# pragma: specific no cover 3.7 3.8 3.9 3.10' and a conflicting '# pragma: specific no cover 3.11' comment, which could suggest a typo or oversight but not malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally imports type hinting functions depending on the Python version, which is a common compatibility pattern. The version check logic appears correct, and no malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The unusual comments seem to be related to test coverage directives, not malicious code. No data leaks, code injection, or external communications are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign compatibility utility for Python version handling of typing features. No malicious behavior, no security risks, and no anomalies of concern were detected.",
