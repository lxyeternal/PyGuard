{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to import specific typing utilities based on the Python version, ensuring compatibility across different Python versions.",
  "sources": "Reads the Python version info from sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "sys.version_info -> conditional import -> imported functions (get_overloads, overload)",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns. The conditional import is standard practice for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward version check to conditionally import typing utilities from different modules depending on the Python version. It does not include any dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The import statements are standard and do not involve any external or untrusted sources. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. The use of sys.version_info is safe and common for version-dependent imports.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard version compatibility snippet with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It simply manages compatibility for typing utilities across different Python versions.",
