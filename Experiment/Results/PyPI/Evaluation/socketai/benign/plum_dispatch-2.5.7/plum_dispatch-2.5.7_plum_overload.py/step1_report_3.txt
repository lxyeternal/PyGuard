  "purpose": "Conditional import of typing utilities based on Python version to ensure compatibility across different Python versions.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info to determine Python version; import statements for get_overloads and overload.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code does not process untrusted data or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only performs version checks and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns observed; straightforward version-based conditional import.",
  "analysis": "The code checks the Python runtime version using sys.version_info. If the version is 3.11 or newer, it imports get_overloads and overload from the standard typing module. Otherwise, it imports them from the typing_extensions package. The purpose is to maintain compatibility across different Python versions, especially since some features in typing_extensions are needed for older Python versions. There is no dynamic code execution, obfuscated logic, or suspicious behavior. The __all__ list explicitly exposes these imported functions. The code is minimal and standard for compatibility handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a simple, well-understood compatibility check and imports without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It poses no security risks and is typical in cross-version Python code.",
