  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports agree that the code performs a straightforward, version-dependent import of 'get_overloads' and 'overload' from either 'typing' or 'typing_extensions'.\n- No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious intent is identified.\n- The code is a typical compatibility pattern used in Python projects to handle differences across Python versions.\n- The comments regarding \"pragma: no cover\" appear to be related to test coverage directives, not malicious code.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code matches the original provided.\n- No issues are present in the code itself.\n- The logic and purpose are clear and benign.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n- No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The comments about \"pragma: no cover\" are standard for test coverage and not indicative of malicious intent.\n- The version check logic is correct and common.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The scores are consistent and justified.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Final note:** The code is a minimal, standard compatibility shim with no security concerns. The reports' evaluations are accurate.",
