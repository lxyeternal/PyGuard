  "purpose": "Import version-specific functions from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' depending on Python version",
  "sources": "Reads Python version info from sys.version_info",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flow leading to vulnerabilities",
  "flows": "sys.version_info -> conditional import of typing functions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version check and import statements",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard version check to conditionally import functions from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions'. It defines __all__ for exports. There are no suspicious behaviors, obfuscated code, or external data sources involved. The import logic appears typical for maintaining compatibility across Python versions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, version-dependent import setup for type hinting utilities. There are no signs of malicious activity, malicious code, or security risks.",
