  "purpose": "Provides compatibility for importing 'get_overloads' and 'overload' functions from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version.",
  "sources": "Reads Python version info via 'sys.version_info'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Version check flows to conditional imports; no external data or code execution involved.",
  "anomalies": "Comments related to test coverage directives ('# pragma: specific no cover ...') are present but benign; no malicious anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple version check to import functions for compatibility. It uses standard patterns without executing external commands or handling untrusted data. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are evident. The comments are related to test coverage and not malicious intent. The logic is straightforward and aligns with common compatibility practices. No suspicious flows or anomalies are detected. The scores from the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are justified and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard compatibility utility with no malicious or obfuscated elements. All reports correctly identify its harmless purpose. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
