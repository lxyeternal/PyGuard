  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the reasoning and scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a typical auto-generated versioning file created by setuptools_scm.\n- It contains static version strings and tuples.\n- The conditional import for type checking is standard practice.\n- No dynamic code, external input, or network operations are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Accurate; describes version info setup.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correct; code is benign, standard, and safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correct; straightforward version info.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Accurate; no issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correct; no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correct; typical auto-generated version metadata.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correct; straightforward version info.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, auto-generated, and contains no malicious or obfuscated content.\n- The malware scores are appropriately set to 0 across all reports.\n- The security risk scores are correctly at 0.\n- The confidence levels are justified at 1 given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- The reasoning is consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendation:**\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and justified.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\nThe reports are thorough and accurate; I concur with their assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, safe versioning setup with no security concerns. The reports' evaluations and scores are appropriate.",
