  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated automatically by setuptools_scm, and includes static version strings and type hints.",
  "sources": "Static version string assignments and conditional type checking imports.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data or untrusted input is processed.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; static assignments are used without external influence.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, auto-generated, with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, auto-generated version info module with no dynamic behavior, external data processing, or network activity. It uses standard practices for type hints and version assignment. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's benign nature is confirmed by the absence of any runtime logic, external dependencies, or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard versioning file with no security concerns or malicious intent. All signals indicate a benign, static module, and the assigned scores are appropriate.",
