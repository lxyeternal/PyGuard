{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated automatically by setuptools_scm, and sets version variables.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version strings and tuples.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or outputs; static variable assignments only.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; all variables are statically assigned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or unusual constructs are present. The code is straightforward and standard for version info.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally defines a type alias for version tuples and assigns version information to variables. It does not perform any data processing, input/output, network operations, or dynamic code execution. It appears to be an auto-generated, static version declaration block with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated version information module with no malicious intent or security risks.",
