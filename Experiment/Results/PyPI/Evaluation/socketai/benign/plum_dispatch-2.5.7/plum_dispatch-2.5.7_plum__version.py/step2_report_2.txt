  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a static, auto-generated versioning file created by setuptools_scm.\n- It only assigns hardcoded version strings and tuples.\n- It uses a conditional import for type checking, which is standard.\n- No external input, dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing occurs.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, standard, and safe.\n- The scores assigned are consistently zero for malware and security risk, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- The purpose, sources, sinks, flows, and anomalies are accurately described, with no contradictions or suspicious elements.\n\n**Critical evaluation:**\n- The code does not perform any runtime logic beyond static assignments.\n- The use of conditional type checking is standard practice and not suspicious.\n- No external data or untrusted input is involved.\n- No obfuscation, hidden behavior, or malicious intent is evident.\n\n**Score justification:**\n- Malware score: 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity detected.\n- Obfuscated score: 0 is appropriate; code is straightforward.\n- Risk score: 0.0 to 0.1 is suitable; the code poses no security risk.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the comprehensive review, I agree with the reports' assessments. The code is a typical, safe versioning file with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (benign, static assignment)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risk)\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the nature of the code.",
