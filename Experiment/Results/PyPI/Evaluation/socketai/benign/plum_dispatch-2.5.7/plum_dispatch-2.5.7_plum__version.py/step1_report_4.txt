{
  "purpose": "The code defines version-related metadata for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, to manage version information without manual edits.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements for version strings and version tuple variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data or external effects; no data leaks or security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Constant version string assignment flows into version variables; no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "Uses conditional type checking block to define version tuple type, which is standard for type hinting. No suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes version metadata for a package, defining version strings and tuples. It includes a conditional block for type checking with standard typing imports, then assigns version info directly as constants. No external input, no data manipulation, no code execution or system interaction. The structure is typical for package version metadata. No signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward auto-generated version metadata script, typical for Python package management, with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
