{
  "purpose": "This code defines versioning information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, primarily for version tracking and type checking purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it solely assigns static version values and imports typing annotations based on a TYPE_CHECKING flag.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or code execution vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks; the code only assigns static values to variables.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains conditional imports for type checking, but all version information is hardcoded as static strings and tuples. No obfuscated code or hidden behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard versioning setup generated by setuptools_scm. It assigns version information to variables for use elsewhere in the package. The TYPE_CHECKING conditional is used solely for type annotations, which is a common pattern. No dynamic code execution, external data, or suspicious patterns are present. The static nature of version strings and the absence of network or file I/O indicates a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe versioning setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It serves purely for package version tracking and type annotations.",
