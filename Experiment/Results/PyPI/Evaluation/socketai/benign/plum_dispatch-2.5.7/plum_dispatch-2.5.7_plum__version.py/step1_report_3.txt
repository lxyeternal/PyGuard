{
  "purpose": "This code defines versioning information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, without performing any runtime logic or data processing.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version string '__version__' and version tuple '__version_tuple__' assigned directly in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs are present; the code does not process or transmit data.",
  "flows": "The code assigns static version values to variables; there are no data flows involving external inputs or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a comment indicating it is auto-generated by setuptools_scm and should not be modified, which is typical for version management files. No suspicious or unusual code behaviors are observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple, static version declaration file commonly generated by setuptools_scm. It uses conditional type hints for type checking, which are standard. All data is statically assigned, with no dynamic code execution, external input processing, or potential security risks. No anomalies or malicious indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated version information file with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves solely to define package version variables for use elsewhere in the package.",
