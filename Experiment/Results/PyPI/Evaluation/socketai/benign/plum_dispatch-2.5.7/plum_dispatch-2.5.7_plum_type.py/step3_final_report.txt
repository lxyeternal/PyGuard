  "purpose": "The code provides utility classes and functions for resolving, delaying, and validating Python type hints, including dynamic retrieval from modules and type validation.",
  "sources": "sys.modules, attribute access via getattr, input parameters to functions, class initializations, and warnings for unresolved hints.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic attribute access in 'retrieve' method, type resolution via get_origin and get_args, and warning messages; no external network or file I/O.",
  "flows": "sys.modules -> getattr -> deliver -> resolve -> get_origin/get_args -> type hint resolution; warnings triggered during resolution failures.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. Use of dynamic attribute access could be risky if modules are malicious, but no malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code manages type hints with classes that delay resolution and retrieve types dynamically from modules. It uses standard Python features like sys.modules and getattr, with no signs of malicious activity. The warnings indicate potential issues in type resolution but are benign. The dynamic retrieval functions could be exploited if used with malicious modules, but as a utility, this pattern is common and safe in trusted environments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured utility for handling Python type hints, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low risk score reflects the potential misuse if modules are malicious, but the code itself is safe.",
