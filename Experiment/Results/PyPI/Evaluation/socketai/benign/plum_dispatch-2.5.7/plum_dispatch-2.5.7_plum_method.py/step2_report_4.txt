  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code defines classes for representing method signatures, extracting data via standard introspection.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or unsafe data handling; data flows are read-only and for display.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a safe utility for introspection and display, with high confidence. Malware score: 0. Obfuscated: 0. Risk: 0.1 (due to very minimal inherent risk in introspection code, but not malicious).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar focus on extracting method info, no external data or unsafe operations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No malicious data flows.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Benign, safe, purely for introspection. Malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines classes for method representation, uses standard introspection.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or malicious data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Utility code for reflection, safe, no malicious intent. Malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above, focusing on extracting and displaying method signatures.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or unsafe data flows.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Safe, standard introspection utility. Malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Consistent with previous, no external data or malicious operations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks or unsafe actions.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Safe, benign utility code. Malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code Behavior:** All reports describe code that performs static introspection, type extraction, and rich text formatting for method signatures. There are no indications of dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, and obfuscation scores of 0, which aligns with the code's straightforward nature.\n- **Risk Scores:** The minimal inherent risk in introspection utilities justifies very low risk scores (~0.1), which are consistent across reports.\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — Very low, justified by the nature of the code; primarily introspection and display.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate given the code's functionality. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis reflects the benign, introspection-focused nature of the code, with negligible security risk.",
