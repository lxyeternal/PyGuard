{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes and functions to handle method signatures, representations, and extraction of argument and return types for callable objects, primarily for introspection and display purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads the implementation of callables, their signatures, and type hints; extracts function names and annotations.",
  "sinks": "None identified that lead to data leakage or malicious actions directly. No untrusted data is written to network, file, or system resources.",
  "flows": "Extracts function signature and type hints from callables, then formats and displays this information; no flow leads to external systems or insecure operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated logic. Uses standard Python introspection and type hints; no dynamic code execution or malicious imports.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python modules and custom classes for introspection and representation. It extracts argument names, types, and return types, and provides visual representations via rich. There is no input/output that could be exploited. The only potential concern is the import of local modules (.repr, .signature, .type, .util), which are assumed safe. No network, file, or system modification code is present. Overall, the code appears benign, serving purely for introspection and display purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, non-malicious implementation intended for method introspection and representation. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
