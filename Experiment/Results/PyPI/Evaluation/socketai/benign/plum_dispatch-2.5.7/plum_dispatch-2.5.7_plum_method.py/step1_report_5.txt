{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes and functions for handling method representations, including extracting argument names and return types, with rich formatting for display purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads data from function signatures, function implementations, and optional parameters such as return_type and function_name.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code does not perform any external data transmission or execute untrusted inputs directly.",
  "flows": "Signature inspection sources data; extract_return_type and extract_arg_names process this data; no flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code relies on standard Python reflection and typing features. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily focuses on introspection of Python functions, extracting argument names, types, and return annotations using standard inspect and custom resolve_type_hint functions. Classes Method and MethodList handle representations with optional rich formatting. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoor access. The imports are from third-party libraries (rich) and local modules, which are typical in such contexts. No suspicious patterns or risky behaviors are observed. Overall, the code is consistent with a utility module for function/method introspection and representation.",
  "conclusion": "This code does not exhibit malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard introspection utility with no signs of supply chain attack vectors or malware. The security risk score is minimal, and the malware score is very low. Confidence in this assessment is high.",
