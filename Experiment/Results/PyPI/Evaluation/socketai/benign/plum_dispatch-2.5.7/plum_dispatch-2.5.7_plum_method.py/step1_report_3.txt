{
  "purpose": "This code defines a 'Method' class and related functions for representing, inspecting, and printing Python methods and their signatures, primarily for use in a rich text interface.",
  "sources": "Reads include importing modules, accessing function attributes (__name__, __annotations__), and inspecting function signatures via inspect_signature(f).",
  "sinks": "Uses functions like repr_type, repr_pyfunction, rich_repr for representations. No sinks involve untrusted data being executed or sent over network.",
  "flows": "Function implementation (__init__) extracts return type and name, then assigns attributes; extract_return_type uses inspect_signature to obtain annotations; other methods primarily generate rich text representations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious data leaks. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated patterns or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for representing methods with metadata, including __init__, equality, copy, and custom repr methods. It employs standard Python introspection to extract function signatures and return types. All operations appear to be focused on descriptive, reflection-based functionality for method metadata. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or malicious code injection. No network activity, code obfuscation, or suspicious data handling is present. The code primarily uses safe library functions and standard Python features.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for representing and inspecting Python methods with rich text output. It does not contain any malicious intent or security risks.",
