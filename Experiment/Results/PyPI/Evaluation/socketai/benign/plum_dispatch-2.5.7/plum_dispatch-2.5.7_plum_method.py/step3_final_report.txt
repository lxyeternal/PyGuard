  "purpose": "The code provides classes and functions for introspecting Python methods, extracting signatures, argument names, return types, and representing them with rich formatting for display purposes.",
  "sources": "Function parameters, function attributes (__name__, __annotations__), inspect_signature function, class attributes (signature, return_type).",
  "sinks": "None; the code only reads data for introspection and display, with no external data handling or transmission.",
  "flows": "Input functions → extract signature and type info → format and display rich text representations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, no external data leaks or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility for method signature introspection and representation, relying on standard Python introspection and custom rich display. It does not perform any unsafe operations, dynamic code execution, or data exfiltration. All reports correctly identify its benign purpose. The malware score is appropriately 0, as there are no malicious behaviors. The risk score is very low, reflecting the safe, read-only nature of the code. Obfuscation is absent, with a score of 0. Confidence in these conclusions is high, given the clarity and standard patterns used.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard utility for introspection and display of method signatures, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk≈0.1 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
