{
  "purpose": "Define classes and functions for representing and extracting method signatures, types, and displaying them with rich formatting.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (inspect, typing, rich) and internal modules (.repr, .signature, .type, .util); processes function signatures and types.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; no data leaks or unsafe code execution observed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow indicating malicious activity; primarily data extraction and formatting.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or misleading variable usage.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines classes Method and MethodList for representing method metadata, along with utility functions to extract argument names and return types from functions. It uses standard introspection via inspect_signature, and rich for display formatting. The functions handle type resolution and signature extraction without executing untrusted code or handling external input. No suspicious network or system calls, no data exfiltration mechanisms, or hidden backdoors are present. The code appears to be a well-structured, secure utility for documentation or introspection purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of method signature extraction and representation, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and purely informational.",
