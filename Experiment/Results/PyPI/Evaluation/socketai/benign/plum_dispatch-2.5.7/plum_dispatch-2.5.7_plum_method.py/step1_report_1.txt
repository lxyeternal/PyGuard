{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes and functions for representing, analyzing, and displaying Python method signatures and types, primarily for introspection and documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function signatures (`inspect_signature`) and function implementations (`implementation.__name__`), as well as signature attributes.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the `repr_pyfunction`, `repr_type`, and `rich_repr` functions which generate string representations and visual outputs. No untrusted data flows to system or network actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function signatures and implementation attributes into representation functions for display. No external or untrusted input is processed in a way that could lead to code execution or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code mainly performs introspection, representation, and structural analysis. No dynamic code execution or unsafe operations detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily uses standard Python introspection (`inspect_signature`), data structures, and string formatting for documentation. It employs safe, read-only introspection methods without executing or evaluating untrusted code. The `repr_*` functions are used for display purposes and do not perform dangerous operations. No obfuscated code, network connections, file manipulations, or malicious activities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code appears to be a safe, introspection and representation utility for Python method signatures. There are no signs of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks. It solely provides structural analysis and display features without executing or transmitting data.",
