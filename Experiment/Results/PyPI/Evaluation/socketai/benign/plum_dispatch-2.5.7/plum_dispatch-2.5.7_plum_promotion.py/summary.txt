  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, extensible type conversion utility with no inherent malicious behavior. The main security concern is the potential misuse if untrusted code registers malicious functions. No malware or obfuscation is present. Proper validation or sandboxing of registered functions can mitigate the risk. Overall, the supply chain risk is low but warrants caution in untrusted environments."
