  "purpose": "Provides functions for type conversion, promotion, and adding custom conversion/promotion rules.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard and third-party libraries; type hints and function definitions; dispatch functions; user-defined conversion and promotion rule additions.",
  "sinks": "Conversion functions, promotion rule functions, and the dynamic dispatch system that can invoke user-defined conversion logic.",
  "flows": "Input objects are received by conversion functions, which may invoke user-defined or internal conversion methods; promotion rules determine common types for objects; conversion functions invoke user-defined conversions based on dispatch.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. Use of dynamic dispatch and user-defined conversion rules could potentially introduce malicious behavior if user code registers malicious converters, but this code itself does not do so. No network activity, file modifications, or system commands are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily implements a flexible type conversion and promotion system using dispatching. It imports standard, third-party, and internal modules. It allows adding custom conversion and promotion rules through user functions. The functions include converting objects, adding rules, and promoting objects to common types. The use of dispatching and user-defined rules could theoretically be exploited if malicious code registers harmful converters, but this is outside the scope of this code. No suspicious behaviors like data exfiltration, network activity, or system modifications are detected. The code structure is straightforward and primarily focused on type management.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a type conversion and promotion framework with flexible rule addition. No evidence of malicious intent or malware is found within this code segment. The primary concern would be if external code registers malicious conversion functions, but this code itself does not include such behavior.",
