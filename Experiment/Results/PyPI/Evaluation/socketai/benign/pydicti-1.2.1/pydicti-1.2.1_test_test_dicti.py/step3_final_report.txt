  "purpose": "A simple Python unit test script for testing the 'build_dicti' function from the 'pydicti' package.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'unittest', 'test.test_common', and 'build_dicti' from 'pydicti'; class attribute assignments; execution of 'unittest.main()'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, external data processing, or system effects; no external sinks present.",
  "flows": "Import statements and class attribute assignments; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; no malicious data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs; straightforward structure; no anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard unit test setup that imports modules, defines a test class, and runs unittest.main(). It does not process external data, perform network operations, or manipulate environment variables. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code. The code's simplicity and lack of external effects confirm its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit test script with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores and reasoning in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
