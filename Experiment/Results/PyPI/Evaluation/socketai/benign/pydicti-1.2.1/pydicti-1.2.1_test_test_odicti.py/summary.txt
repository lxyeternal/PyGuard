  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard testing script with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis. The slight elevation to 0.1 in some reports is overly cautious; a score of 0 is more accurate given the benign nature."
