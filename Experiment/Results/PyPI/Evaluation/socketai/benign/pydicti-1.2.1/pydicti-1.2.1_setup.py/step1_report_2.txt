{
  "purpose": "To set up and install a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "No explicit sources; code does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; the code is minimal and follows typical setup script pattern. No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setup' function from setuptools and calls it with default parameters. This is a common pattern in Python packaging scripts. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious actions, or anomalies. The script is simple and standard, with no data input, data processing, or network activity.",
  "conclusion": "This is a basic setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It appears benign and typical for package distribution.",
