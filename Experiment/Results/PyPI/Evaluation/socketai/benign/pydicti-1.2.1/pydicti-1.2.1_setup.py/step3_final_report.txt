  "purpose": "A minimal setup script for packaging a Python project using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'setup' from 'setuptools' and calls setup() with default parameters; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or write to files.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code simply invokes setup() without data flow or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a standard, minimal setup script with no suspicious constructs or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, standard 'setup.py' script used in Python packaging. It contains no malicious behavior, no external data processing, and no security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. There are no anomalies or suspicious patterns. The code's simplicity and standard usage justify the scores and conclusions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications to scores or conclusions are necessary.",
