  "purpose": "To set up and install a Python package using setuptools",
  "sources": "No external data sources; uses static import and function call",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or external communication",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from source to sink",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; standard setup invocation with no parameters or custom logic",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setup' function from 'setuptools' and calls it with default parameters. There are no arguments, user inputs, environment variable accesses, or dynamic behaviors. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code are present. It appears to be a minimal setup script typical for packaging Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign setup invocation with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
