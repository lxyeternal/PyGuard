  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's actual behavior, the scoring rationale, and potential inconsistencies.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Recognizes the code as a utility for case-insensitive dicts, with no malicious intent, malware, or obfuscation. It notes the internal structure, normalization, and preservation of original key casing.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0.2, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code. The security risk score of 0.2 seems slightly high given the benign nature; however, since the code handles data structures that could, in theory, be misused if combined with untrusted data, a low but non-zero risk score is acceptable.\n\n- **Malware:** Correctly 0, as there's no malicious code.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** Correctly 0, no obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly elevated but justifiable due to potential misuse in broader contexts.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing correctness, safety, and lack of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0\n\n- **Assessment:** The total absence of security risk is justified; the code is straightforward.\n\n- **Verdict:** Fully aligned with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates safe, standard implementation, no external network activity, no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0, Obfuscated: 0\n\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, describes the code as a straightforward, transparent implementation with no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0, Obfuscated: 0\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and justified.\n\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights that the code is safe, with no malicious intent, no data leakage, no network activity, and standard practices.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0, Obfuscated: 0\n\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent.\n\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code or behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, as the code is clear, well-structured, and uses standard patterns.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation, with some reports assigning 0.2 to account for potential misuse or broader security implications. Given the code's benign nature, a risk score of 0.2 seems reasonable but could be slightly lowered to 0.1 for conservativeness.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, due to the utility nature and potential misuse, but no actual vulnerabilities)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent with the code. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks beyond standard data handling. The scores are reasonable, perhaps slightly conservative, but justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.1\n\nThis reflects the code's benign, utility-focused implementation with no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
