{
  "purpose": "Implement case insensitive dictionary classes and factory functions for creating such dictionaries, including ordered and regular variants, with normalization of keys.",
  "sources": "import statements, normalize_case function, _make_dicti function, build_dicti function, Dicti factory function",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data, no network operations, no file operations, no code execution, no external data transmissions.",
  "flows": "Input data from dictionary or arguments flows into dictionary construction via __init__, update, and copy methods; normalization functions process keys for case insensitivity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; the code primarily implements standard data structures with normalization logic, no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions and classes to create case insensitive dictionaries, supporting both mutable and ordered variants. It uses internal mappings to preserve original key casing while enabling case-insensitive lookups. No external data access, no network activity, and no code injection mechanisms are present. All components serve the purpose of dictionary normalization and extension, with comments explaining the implementation details. The functions and classes are standard and transparent, with no hidden behaviors or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of case insensitive dictionaries with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as a utility module for dictionary normalization and customization, maintaining transparency and standard practices.",
