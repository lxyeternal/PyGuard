  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-implemented utility for case-insensitive dictionaries with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal security risk stems from potential misuse with untrusted data, which is typical for such utilities but does not indicate any inherent security flaw."
