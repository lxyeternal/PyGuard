  "purpose": "Provide case insensitive dictionary implementations and utilities for Python, including mutable, ordered, and copy creation features.",
  "sources": "Functions normalize_case(), _make_dicti(), build_dicti(), Dicti(), and class definitions for dicti and odicti.",
  "sinks": "Method implementations that manipulate or access internal dictionaries (__getitem__, __setitem__, __delitem__, update, pop, clear, etc.) that handle key normalization and data storage.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input keys through normalize_case function to internal dictionaries via __getitem__, __setitem__, __delitem__, etc., maintaining case insensitivity. No external or untrusted sources are explicitly integrated.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. The code strictly implements a case insensitive dictionary with no external network connections, no system modifications, and no cryptic operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a case insensitive dictionary class 'dicti' and an ordered variant 'odicti' with associated utility functions. It employs key normalization via 'normalize_case', primarily using 'casefold' or 'lower' methods, to enable case-insensitive lookups while preserving original key casing in outputs. No external inputs, network activities, or system modifications are present. All methods operate on internal data structures, and no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are detected. The code relies on standard Python collections, and the use of deepcopy and copy functions appears standard. The internal implementation employs common patterns for case-insensitive dicts, including maintaining a secondary mapping for key normalization, which is safe and transparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a standard, well-structured case insensitive dictionary system without any malicious intent or suspicious behaviors. It contains no signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks beyond normal data handling logic. The code appears to be a safe utility library for case insensitive dicts.",
