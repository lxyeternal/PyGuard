  "purpose": "Demonstration and testing of custom dictionary utility functions and classes.",
  "sources": "In-memory variables and data structures, such as 'd', 'o', and the imported functions from 'pydicti'.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network communication, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to internal function calls and variable assignments within the code; no untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Multiple reassignments to '_' are stylistic; no obfuscation or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports custom dictionary functions and classes, creates instances of standard and custom dict types, and performs straightforward conversions and assignments. There are no external inputs, outputs, or system modifications. The repeated use of '_' as a variable is typical in testing or demonstration code. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are present. The code's purpose appears benign, focusing on utility functions for dictionaries.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. It functions as a demonstration of dictionary utility functions. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are appropriate; however, given the lack of any security concern, the securityRisk can be confidently set to 0.",
