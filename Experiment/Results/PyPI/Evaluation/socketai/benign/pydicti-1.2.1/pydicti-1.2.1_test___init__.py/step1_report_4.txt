  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be a standard Python module with no clear malicious intent, potentially for general functionality.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from environment variables, function parameters, and possibly external libraries, but no direct user input or network data sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system commands, network connections, or data handling functions if used improperly; however, none are explicitly shown in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or function inputs to internal processing functions; no clear flow to external systems or untrusted sinks is identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs detected. The code structure appears straightforward without obfuscation or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple Python module with standard imports and functions, with no signs of malicious payloads or obfuscated logic. There are no evident network connections, system modifications, or data exfiltration mechanisms. Usage of third-party libraries is not suspicious, and no code injection points are visible. The code's intent seems benign, focusing on routine data processing.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain security risks. The code appears to be standard, with no suspicious activities or backdoors. The overall security risk is low.",
