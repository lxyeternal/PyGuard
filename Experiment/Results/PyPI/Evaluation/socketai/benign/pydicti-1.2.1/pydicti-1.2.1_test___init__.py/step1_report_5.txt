{
  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize a Python package, import necessary modules, and perform some basic operations related to configuration and utility functions.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables and external modules imported at the beginning of the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are network connections, file operations, or data output points, but none are explicitly shown in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or imported modules through functions and possibly to output or external calls, but no explicit flow is visible due to the incomplete snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are evident. The code structure appears standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code starts with standard imports and configuration setup, without any signs of malicious behavior. No unusual patterns, such as dynamic code execution, hidden backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms, are apparent. The absence of network or system calls makes malicious activity unlikely. The code seems to serve typical utility purposes in a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be standard, with no signs of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
