  "purpose": "Analyze the provided Python code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data reading points, environment variables, network connections, file operations, eval()/exec() calls.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission functions, file write/read, eval()/exec() execution points, environment variable access, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input data or environment variables to eval()/exec() or network functions, indicating potential malicious data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated code with eval()/exec(), hardcoded secrets, unusual dynamic code execution, suspicious network connections, or data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation with dynamic code execution, indicating potential malicious intent. No benign patterns or standard library usage suggestive of safe behavior are observed. The presence of eval()/exec() with obfuscated variables constitutes a high-risk flow. No suspicious network activity or data leakage is explicitly identified, but the obfuscation and dynamic execution are significant indicators of malicious behavior. The code's structure and signals justify a high malware score and security risk assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates high obfuscation and dynamic execution, strongly indicating malicious intent. The overall security risk is high, and the malware likelihood is significant. It should be treated as malicious and avoided or further analyzed in a secure environment.",
