{
  "purpose": "The code exports specific functions and variables from a local module, likely for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from the relative module '.pydicti', specifically __version__, dicti, odicti, Dicti, build_dicti.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or leaked; primarily just setting variables and __all__.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the imported module to the current namespace, then to external modules via exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code appears straightforward and standard for module exports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific attributes from a local module, reassigns __version__, and defines __all__ for public API. There are no suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious indicators. The structure is typical for Python package modules focused on exporting functions and variables.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module interface with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
