  "purpose": "Re-exporting symbols from a local module for external use",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module '.pydicti'",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data sinks or external outputs",
  "flows": "Imported symbols are re-exported without modification; no data flows to external sinks",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific attributes from a local module '.pydicti', re-assigns __version__, and defines __all__ for public API exposure. It appears to be a standard module __init__.py style file. No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated behavior is detected. No external network activity, no data leaks, and no code injection patterns are present. The code is minimal and straightforward, indicating typical package structure.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a simple re-export of module symbols, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
