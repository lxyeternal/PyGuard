  "purpose": "Exporting specific functions and version information from a local module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module (.pydicti), specifically __version__, dicti, odicti, Dicti, build_dicti.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data effects identified.",
  "flows": "Import from .pydicti -> Assign __version__ -> Define __all__ list for exports.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward and standard for module exports. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific symbols from a local module (.pydicti), reassigns __version__ to itself (which is redundant but not malicious), and defines an __all__ list for export. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The code is minimal, typical for a module's __init__.py or API surface setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module export pattern with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply re-exports symbols from a local module, with no suspicious behavior observed.",
