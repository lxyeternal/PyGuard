{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific functions and variables from a local module and defines the module's version and exported symbols.",
  "sources": "The code reads the local module '.pydicti' to import '__version__', 'dicti', 'odicti', 'Dicti', and 'build_dicti'.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data, nor does it perform network operations or file manipulations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code simply imports and assigns values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated elements are present. The use of a relative import is standard in package modules.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific components from a local module, assigns the version, and defines what symbols are exported. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues. The structure appears typical for Python package __init__.py files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module initialization script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
