  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward module setup, importing symbols from a local module `.pydicti`, reassigning `__version__` to itself (which is redundant but benign), and defining `__all__` for exports.\n- No untrusted data sources or sinks are identified.\n- No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are observed.\n- The code structure is typical for a Python package's `__init__.py` or module export file.\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1, with malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores at 0.\n\n**Confirming the code's content:**\n- The code imports specific symbols from `.pydicti`.\n- It reassigns `__version__` to itself, which is redundant but not malicious.\n- It defines `__all__` for explicit exports.\n- There are no signs of dynamic code execution, external communication, or data leaks.\n\n**Assessment of potential issues:**\n- No evidence of malicious activity, malware, or obfuscation.\n- The code appears to be a standard module initialization or API surface definition.\n- The \"anomalies\" noted are benign, primarily the redundant assignment.\n\n**Scores and their justification:**\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity or indicators.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0 — no security risks identified; the code is purely for module export purposes.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The overall code and reports align with a benign, standard module export pattern.\n- No changes needed to the scores; they are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate; the code is benign, with no security concerns.",
