  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks identified",
  "flows": "Import symbols -> assign __version__ -> define __all__",
  "anomalies": "Redundant assignment '__version__ = __version__' (benign)",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module setup, importing specific symbols from a local module, reassigning __version__ to itself, and defining __all__ for exports. No dynamic code execution, external communication, or data leaks are present. The code structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py or similar module. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected. The redundant assignment is benign and common in boilerplate code. All signals indicate a benign, standard pattern with no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module export pattern with no malicious activity or security concerns. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
