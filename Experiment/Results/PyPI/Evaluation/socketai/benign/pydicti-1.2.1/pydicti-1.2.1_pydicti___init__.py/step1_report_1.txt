  "purpose": "Define module exports and re-export specific items from a local module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module '.pydicti'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "Imported module components are assigned to variables and listed in __all__ for export; no flow of untrusted data or execution of external code.",
  "anomalies": "Redundant assignment '__version__ = __version__' may indicate an attempt to expose version info, but it is benign. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated elements observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports version and functions from a local module, re-assigns the version variable to itself, and defines __all__ for module exports. No input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no external communication present. The structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py or module definition. There are no signs of malicious activity or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is straightforward module setup code with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It merely re-exports selected functions and version info from a local module. No suspicious behavior, malware, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
