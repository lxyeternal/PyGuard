  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, importing symbols from a local module and defining __all__ for exports.\n- No untrusted data sources, external communications, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The only anomaly noted is the redundant assignment `__version__ = __version__`, which is benign.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code structure is typical for a Python package's `__init__.py` or module setup.\n- The import from a relative module `.pydicti` is standard and does not raise suspicion.\n- The scores assigned are all zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- The reports are consistent and do not identify any actual malicious activity.\n- The only questionable aspect is the redundant assignment, which is benign.\n\n**My assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Justification:**\n- The code is a minimal, standard module setup for exposing symbols.\n- No evidence of malicious intent, data leaks, or obfuscation.\n- The redundant assignment does not introduce risk.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate, and I agree with their assessments. The code is benign and typical for module exports.\n\n---\n\n**Final scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
