  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with no malicious intent. The primary concern is dynamic code execution via eval/exec, which warrants a higher malware score (from 0.2 to 0.4) to account for potential exploitation risk. Obfuscation remains unlikely. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily due to eval/exec usage. The current assessments are reasonable, with a slight increase in malware scoring for Report 3 to better reflect the potential threat."
