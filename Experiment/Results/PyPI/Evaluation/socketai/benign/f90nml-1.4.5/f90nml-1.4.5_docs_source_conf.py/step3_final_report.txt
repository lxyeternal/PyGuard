  "purpose": "Configuration setup for Sphinx documentation for the 'f90nml' package, including import statements, path modifications, and documentation parameters.",
  "sources": "Imports 'os', 'sys', and 'f90nml'; reads version info from 'f90nml'; modifies 'sys.path' for module discovery.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution; purely static configuration.",
  "flows": "Static data flow from module imports and path modifications; no external or untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "sys.path modifications are typical but could be exploited if environment is compromised; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration script with benign imports and path modifications. It extracts package metadata for documentation purposes. No suspicious behaviors, code injection, or network activity are present. The sys.path modifications are typical for local setup and do not indicate malicious intent. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns. The assigned scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard configuration script for Sphinx documentation with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are accurate and should remain at zero across all categories.",
