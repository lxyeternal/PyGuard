  "conclusion": "The setup script is safe, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated code. The only potential external risk is the content of scripts in 'bin', which should be verified separately. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score (~0.2) accounts for the inclusion of 'bin' scripts but does not indicate actual threat."
