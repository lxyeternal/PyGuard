{
  "purpose": "Standard setup script for the 'f90nml' Python package, performing package metadata definition, version import, README reading, script listing, and test command setup.",
  "sources": "Reads version info via __import__, reads README file, lists files in 'bin' directory.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processed into dangerous functions or network calls.",
  "flows": "Imports version from package, reads README, lists 'bin' scripts, passes data to setup().",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets; standard practices used.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script that performs package configuration without executing untrusted code or network activity. Listing scripts in 'bin' is standard, though the safety depends on their content, which is outside this script's scope. No code injection, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present. The use of __import__ for version retrieval is common and safe unless the package's __init__.py is malicious, which is unlikely. The test command runs local unittests, not external or malicious code. Overall, the script is benign and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is safe, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated code. The only potential external risk is the content of scripts in 'bin', which should be verified separately. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score (~0.2) accounts for the inclusion of 'bin' scripts but does not indicate actual threat.",
