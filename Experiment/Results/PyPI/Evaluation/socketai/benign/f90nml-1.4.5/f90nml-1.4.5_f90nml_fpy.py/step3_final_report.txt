  "purpose": "Utility functions to convert Fortran string representations of data types into Python native types, including float, complex, boolean, and string.",
  "sources": "Input strings provided to each conversion function (pyfloat, pycomplex, pybool, pystr).",
  "sinks": "Conversion outputs; no external sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed through regex, string splitting, and matching to produce Python data types; no external or untrusted data flows outside the functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; use of assertions for validation, which are standard but can be disabled in optimized runs; string replacement in pystr uses '2 * quote', which is a standard pattern for handling doubled quotes, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward data conversions with input validation via assertions. It uses regex for float parsing, string splitting for complex numbers, and string matching for booleans. No external calls, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. The code is simple, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or malicious patterns. The assertions are safe validation practices, though they can be disabled with Python optimization flags. The string replacement in pystr is standard for handling doubled quotes. Overall, the code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard utility module for converting Fortran data representations into Python types. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
