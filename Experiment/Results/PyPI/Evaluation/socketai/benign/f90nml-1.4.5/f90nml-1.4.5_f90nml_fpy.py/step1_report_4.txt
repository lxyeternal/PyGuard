  "purpose": "Convert Fortran data type string representations into Python native data types.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions: v_str, strict_logical; data within regex replacements.",
  "sinks": "Conversion functions like float(), complex(), and string replacements, which process input data.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed via regex, string manipulation, and conversions into Python data types.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Use of assert statements is safe in this context. String replacements are standard, no suspicious replacements detected. No dynamic code execution or network operations present.",
  "analysis": "The code converts string representations of Fortran data types to Python types through regex substitution and parsing. It includes input validation via assertions and controlled conversions. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or external communications. The functions are straightforward data converters, and the string manipulation appears benign. The code is well-structured and adheres to normal data processing patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for converting Fortran data representations into Python. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. The code is safe for use in production.",
