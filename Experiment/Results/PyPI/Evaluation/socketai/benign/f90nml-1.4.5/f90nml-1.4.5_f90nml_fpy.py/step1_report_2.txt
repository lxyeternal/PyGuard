  "purpose": "This module provides functions to convert string representations of Fortran data types into Python native data types.",
  "sources": "Input strings passed to functions: v_str in pyfloat, pycomplex, pybool, and pystr.",
  "sinks": "Conversion functions that generate Python data types; no direct untrusted data sinks like network, file, or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "Input strings from external sources are processed through regex replacements and string manipulations to produce Python data types.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs straightforward conversions; no suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. Replacement of escaped quotes in pystr uses '2 * quote' which is unconventional but not malicious; it appears to replace doubled quote characters.",
  "analysis": "The functions perform basic data type conversions with input validation via assertions. The regex in pyfloat is used for scientific notation, and complex numbers are parsed with string splitting. The boolean conversion considers multiple Fortran logical representations. String conversion handles quotes and escape sequences. No external calls, no network operations, and no code execution are evident. The replacement in pystr does not invoke eval or exec; it simply replaces doubled quote characters. Overall, the code appears to be standard conversion logic with no signs of malicious intent or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of Fortran to Python data conversions with no malicious behavior detected. It serves its intended purpose without performing any harmful actions or exfiltration.",
