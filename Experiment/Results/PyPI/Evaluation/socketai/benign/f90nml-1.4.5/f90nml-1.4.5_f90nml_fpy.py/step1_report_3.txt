  "purpose": "This module provides functions to convert string representations of Fortran data types into Python native data types.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function parameters, primarily string inputs representing Fortran values.",
  "sinks": "Data is processed within the functions and returned; no external data sinks or side effects are present.",
  "flows": "Input strings are validated and transformed into Python data types within each function; no external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses assertions for input type validation but does not include any suspicious or malicious code. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. String replacement and regex are used purely for data conversion.",
  "analysis": "The functions perform straightforward conversions of Fortran data representations to Python types. The use of regex in pyfloat replaces 'D'/'d' with 'e' for float conversion, which is standard practice. The complex number parsing splits input strings and converts components. The boolean conversion handles various Fortran logical constants. String conversion manages quoted strings and escape sequences. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is detected. No external system calls, network operations, or file manipulations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for data conversion with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured, with appropriate input validation, and does not perform any unsafe operations or external interactions.",
