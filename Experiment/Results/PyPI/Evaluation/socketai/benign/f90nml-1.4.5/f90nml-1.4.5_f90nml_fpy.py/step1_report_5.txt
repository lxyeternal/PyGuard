{
  "purpose": "This module provides functions to convert string representations of Fortran data types into Python data types.",
  "sources": "The code reads input strings from function arguments, mainly in pyfloat, pycomplex, pybool, and pystr functions.",
  "sinks": "The functions return converted Python values; no direct output or data leaks are evident. No system calls, network connections, or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed through regex or string operations and then converted to Python types; no external or untrusted data flows into insecure sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward with no signs of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic. String replacements are standard for parsing; no obfuscation or misleading code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs data parsing and type conversions with proper assertions to validate input types. Regex is used for floating point conversions, and string splitting for complex numbers, which are typical operations. The boolean parsing allows for flexible interpretation of logical strings, with strict and lenient modes. String handling includes proper quotes management. No suspicious or malicious patterns, such as system calls, network operations, or dynamic code execution, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data conversion utility for Fortran data types, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and well-structured for its intended purpose.",
