  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a convex optimization problem setup. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements, no obfuscation, and poses minimal security risk. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is appropriately very low (~0.1). The overall confidence in this assessment is high."
