  "purpose": "Setup and solve a convex optimization problem involving exponential and zero cones using the Clarabel library.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded problem data including matrices P, A, vectors q, b, and cone definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data input, output, or network activity.",
  "flows": "Data flows from problem data definitions to the solver invocation; no untrusted data sources or external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward mathematical modeling code with clear structure.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard scientific libraries and the Clarabel optimization library, constructs problem data with fixed constants, and calls the solver directly. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or external data handling. The problem setup appears correct and typical for convex optimization tasks. No suspicious behaviors, network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code is transparent and standard, with no indications of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a convex optimization problem setup. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements, no obfuscation, and poses minimal security risk. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is appropriately very low (~0.1). The overall confidence in this assessment is high.",
