  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup for a convex optimization problem with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports—malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1—are appropriate, though a security risk score of 0 would also be justified given the benign nature. Overall, the code is safe and free of malicious or obfuscating elements."
