  "purpose": "Load a JSON problem file, solve it using the clarabel library, and optionally export the solution.",
  "sources": "Reading __file__ for current directory, reading JSON file via clarabel.read_from_file",
  "sinks": "Potentially reading from a user-supplied JSON file; no output to untrusted locations; commented code for exporting data is inactive",
  "flows": "File path constructed from __file__ -> clarabel.read_from_file -> solving process",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a file path based on the current script's location and reads data from a JSON file using the clarabel library. It then solves the problem and has commented code for writing output, which is inactive. The use of __file__ and standard library functions indicates normal operation without any suspicious behavior. No external or untrusted data sources other than the local JSON file are involved. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for loading and solving a problem with clarabel, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
