{
  "purpose": "The code loads a JSON file, processes it with the 'clarabel' library, and optionally exports the solution.",
  "sources": "The code reads a JSON file located relative to the script directory using os.path.join.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or output untrusted data; it only prints the filename and processes it internally.",
  "flows": "File path construction from __file__ to JSON loading, then solving with clarabel.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code constructs, no obfuscated code, no network activity.",
  "analysis": "The script constructs a file path based on its directory, loads data using the clarabel library, and solves a problem. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The commented-out file write operation is benign. The usage of clarabel appears legitimate, assuming the library is trusted and properly vetted. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard data processing script utilizing the clarabel library with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
