  "purpose": "Load a JSON data file, process it with the clarabel solver, and optionally export the solution.",
  "sources": "Reading the JSON file from a relative path using os.path.join and __file__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external communication; local file read only.",
  "flows": "Source: reading JSON file -> clarabel.read_from_file -> solver.solve() -> (optional) write to file.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward local file loading, processing with a third-party library, and optional output. No malicious behavior, network activity, or obfuscation detected. The use of __file__ for path construction is standard. The code does not handle untrusted input or perform risky operations. The security risk is minimal, and malware suspicion is unwarranted. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns justify a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious activity or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
