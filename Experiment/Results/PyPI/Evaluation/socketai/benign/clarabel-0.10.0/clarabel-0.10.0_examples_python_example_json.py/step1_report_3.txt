{
  "purpose": "The code loads a JSON data file, processes it with the clarabel solver, and optionally exports the solution.",
  "sources": "Reads the JSON file '../data/hs35.json' from the script directory using os.path.join and __file__.",
  "sinks": "Calls clarabel.read_from_file() to load data; no other sinks involving untrusted data.",
  "flows": "File path constructed from input (__file__) -> clarabel.read_from_file() -> process data.",
  "anomalies": "Uses __file__ for dynamic file path construction, which is common; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code. No evidence of code injection, data leakage, or malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The script constructs a file path relative to its location and loads JSON data into a clarabel solver object. The code is straightforward, with no dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity. The commented-out code for exporting data is benign. The code appears standard for data processing workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical data loading and processing script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on the clarabel library for processing, which by itself is not suspicious. No malicious activity or supply chain attack indicators are present.",
