{
  "purpose": "Re-exporting contents from the clarabel module and forcing the loading of BLAS and LAPACK libraries",
  "sources": "Import statement from .clarabel, accessing clarabel.__doc__, and hasattr check on clarabel",
  "sinks": "None directly present; no data being sent or written to external sources",
  "flows": "Import from local module -> access clarabel attributes -> call clarabel.force_load_blas_lapack()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic observed. The function call to force_load_blas_lapack() could potentially load optimized math libraries, which is common in scientific computing.",
  "analysis": "The code imports all contents from a local module 'clarabel' and re-exports its documentation and __all__ attribute if available. It then calls a function 'force_load_blas_lapack()' from clarabel, which appears to be intended to ensure that linear algebra libraries (BLAS and LAPACK) are loaded. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors. The function call is typical in numerical computing packages to ensure performance libraries are loaded. The code is straightforward and structurally simple, with no anomalies or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a module re-exporter with an explicit call to load performance libraries. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate setup code common in scientific or numerical Python packages.",
