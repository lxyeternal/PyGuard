{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the 'clarabel' module and sets up documentation and export variables, then calls a function to force load BLAS and LAPACK libraries.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .clarabel, attribute check for __all__, call to clarabel.force_load_blas_lapack()",
  "sinks": "call to clarabel.force_load_blas_lapack() potentially triggers library loading, but no untrusted data handling or network activity is present",
  "flows": "import from .clarabel -> check for __all__ -> call to clarabel.force_load_blas_lapack()",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code primarily re-exports content from the clarabel module, which is standard practice for packaging or modular design. The call to force_load_blas_lapack() appears to be a routine library initialization step for numerical computations. No source-to-sink data flows involve untrusted input, and no malicious behavior or obfuscated code is evident. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module wrapper that imports and initializes a numerical library. There is no malicious activity or security concern detected based on this fragment.",
