  "purpose": "Re-exporting contents from the clarabel module and ensuring native BLAS/LAPACK libraries are loaded for optimized numerical computations.",
  "sources": "Import from .clarabel, access to clarabel.__doc__, clarabel.__all__, and call to clarabel.force_load_blas_lapack()",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks or external communications are present",
  "flows": "Import from clarabel → setting module attributes → calling force_load_blas_lapack() to load native libraries",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and initialization code, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports all from a local module, copies documentation and __all__ attributes if present, and calls a function to load BLAS and LAPACK libraries. This pattern is typical in scientific packages to ensure optimized linear algebra routines are available. No malicious activity, network communication, or data exfiltration is evident. The function likely loads native libraries for performance, which is standard practice. The code is simple, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module setup snippet for a scientific Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscation scores are zero, and the risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting routine native library loading.",
