  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same core code: importing from `.clarabel`, copying `__doc__` and `__all__`, then calling `clarabel.force_load_blas_lapack()`.\n- No reports indicate any suspicious or malicious activity, such as network communication, data exfiltration, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n- The function `force_load_blas_lapack()` appears to be a routine operation to load optimized numerical libraries, common in scientific computing packages.\n- The code is straightforward, with no anomalies, backdoors, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are confirmed. The code is simple and standard for a scientific package setup.\n\n### Logical and reasoning flaws:\n- **Flaws in reasoning:** None detected. The reports correctly identify the purpose as module re-exporting and library loading.\n- **Potential overinterpretation:** Some reports mention \"potentially load native libraries or perform system-level operations\" but acknowledge the lack of evidence for malicious intent.\n\n### Scores and their justification:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Security risk scores:** Very low (around 0.1 to 0.2), which is reasonable given the context.\n- **Confidence levels:** High (around 0.9 to 1), justified by the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n### Any inconsistencies or unreasonable scores?\n- No. The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (minimal, routine setup code)\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- Since the `force_load_blas_lapack()` function could internally load native libraries, it’s worth noting that such calls are common and generally benign in numerical packages. Without access to its implementation, there's no reason to suspect malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n## Summary:\n- The code is a standard module re-export and setup snippet for a scientific Python package.\n- No issues of security, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n- The current scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n## Final recommendation:\n**I would assign the following scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, routine setup)\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the nature of the code.",
