  "purpose": "Parser and editor for WikiLink syntax, operating on internal string data with regex-based matching and string manipulation.",
  "sources": "Reads from self._shadow and internal match objects; accesses self.string for content span calculations.",
  "sinks": "Modifies internal string attributes via slicing, insertion, and deletion; no external data or network operations.",
  "flows": "Source: _shadow or self.string; Sink: string modifications in target, text, fragment, title properties.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or external data flows; regex is complex but solely for parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward parser and editor for wiki links, using regex for matching and string slicing for modifications. It caches matches for efficiency and provides property methods for safe manipulation. No external communication, code injection, or malicious payloads are present. The regex pattern is complex but intended solely for parsing syntax, not obfuscation. The code operates solely on internal data, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured parser/editor for WikiLink syntax, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The scores of malware=0 and obfuscated=0 are appropriate. The security risk is minimal; a conservative estimate of 0.1-0.2 reflects potential concerns if untrusted data influences input, but the code itself does not process untrusted external data directly.",
