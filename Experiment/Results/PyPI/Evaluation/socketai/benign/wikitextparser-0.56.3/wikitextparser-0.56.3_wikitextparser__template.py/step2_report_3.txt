  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's behavior, data flows, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes the Template class, which manipulates template strings and arguments.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data transfer; operations are internal string manipulations.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Uses standard regex; no obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity; the code is a typical parser.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The report correctly identifies the code as safe.  \n- The malware score is appropriately 0.  \n- The obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk is 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1; focuses on string processing.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Internal modifications, no external communication.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code or obfuscation; standard regex usage.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe parser, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The malware score remains at 0.  \n- The obfuscated score is 0.  \n- Security risk is minimal, assigned as 0.2, which is acceptable given the context.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same general purpose; manipulates arguments and names.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Argument modifications are internal; no external data leaks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, no network activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Functionally safe, legitimate code.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Malware score is 0, consistent with the analysis.  \n- Obfuscated score is 0.  \n- Security risk is 0.2, which seems reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar argument management functions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data transfer; internal string processing.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate parser, safe to use.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Malware score is 0.  \n- Obfuscated score is 0.  \n- Security risk is 0.2, acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard argument and name normalization.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external communication; purely internal string handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, safe code.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Malware score is 0.  \n- Obfuscated score is 0.  \n- Security risk is 0.1, reflecting minimal concern.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, consistent with the analysis that the code performs safe string processing and argument management.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, as no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are present.\n- **Risk scores:** They are low (0 or 0.2), aligning with the fact that the code handles internal data safely and does not perform external actions.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a standard template parser and manipulator, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or malicious data flows.\n- No external network, file, or system operations are involved.\n- The regex usage appears legitimate and not obfuscated.\n- The argument management functions are straightforward and do not introduce security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (consistent with the reports)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and the current scores are appropriate.",
