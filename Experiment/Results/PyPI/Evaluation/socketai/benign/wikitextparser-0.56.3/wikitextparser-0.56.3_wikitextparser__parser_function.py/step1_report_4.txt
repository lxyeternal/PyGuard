  "purpose": "Define classes for parsing and handling wiki text with arguments, including template and parser function processing.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class attribute definitions, property methods, and function definitions.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data directly affects external systems or causes data leaks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from `_shadow` to arguments parsing and name extraction; no external input directly influences flow at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "Use of pattern matching with potentially complex regex, but no dynamic code execution or obfuscation. The code structure appears straightforward. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code segments identified.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily implements argument parsing logic for wiki templates, using regex matching and data structure manipulations. No indications of malicious behavior such as network access, file manipulation, or code injection. The regex pattern is used for parsing argument segments, but it is standard pattern matching without dynamic code execution. The class design uses properties and class attributes to manage parsing states. No signs of backdoors, hidden payloads, or malicious data handling. Overall, the code appears to be a well-structured, purpose-specific parser module with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a parsing utility for wiki text arguments with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It mainly handles data parsing and structure without external side-effects. The security risk is very low.",
