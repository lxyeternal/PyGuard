  "purpose": "Classes for handling wiki text with arguments, argument parsing, list extraction.",
  "sources": "Internal attributes like '_shadow', regex pattern 'PF_NAME_ARGS_FULLMATCH', method calls on self.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data leaks; internal data handling only.",
  "flows": "Data flows from '_shadow' through regex matching to Argument objects and list extraction methods.",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex with byte strings; '_name_args_matcher' set to NotImplemented, indicating incomplete implementation but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for parsing wiki text with arguments, utilizing regex patterns and internal attributes. No network, file, or system calls are present. The regex pattern is standard for argument parsing. The use of internal attributes such as '_shadow' and '_type_to_spans' is typical for parsers and does not suggest obfuscation or malicious intent. The placeholder 'NotImplemented' indicates incomplete code, not malicious behavior. Overall, the code is a straightforward parser module with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured parser for wiki text arguments, with no evidence of malicious or obfuscated behavior. The current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
