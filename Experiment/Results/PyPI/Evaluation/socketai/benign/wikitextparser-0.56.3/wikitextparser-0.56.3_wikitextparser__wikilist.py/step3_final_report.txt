  "purpose": "A parser for wiki-style lists utilizing regex pattern matching to identify list items, sublists, and nesting levels.",
  "sources": "Input string or list of strings; regex pattern matches for list items, sublists, and pattern replacements.",
  "sinks": "Internal data structures; no external data sinks or system interactions.",
  "flows": "Input string → regex pattern matching → extraction of list items and sublists → internal list construction.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution; complex regex but used solely for parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code employs regex patterns to parse wiki-style lists, managing nested lists and list item extraction. It uses external regex library for pattern matching, but only for internal string processing. No external system calls, network activity, or code execution are present. The regex patterns are complex but serve parsing purposes, not malicious behavior. No signs of obfuscation or malicious code. The class methods handle list item extraction, sublist retrieval, and pattern replacement in a straightforward manner. Overall, the code is a standard, well-structured parser with no security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, regex-based parser for wiki lists with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It is well-structured, with no obfuscation or malicious behavior detected. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to potential regex DoS if processing malicious input, but no such exploitation is evident. Malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and a low security risk score (~0.2) is appropriate.",
