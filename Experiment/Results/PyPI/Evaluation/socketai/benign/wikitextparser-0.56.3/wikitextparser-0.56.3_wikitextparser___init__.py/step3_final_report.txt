{
  "purpose": "Module setup and namespace configuration for a wiki text processing library, importing internal components and assigning them to the module namespace.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules, attribute assignments to the _wikitext module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, external communication, or output operations detected.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; only internal attribute assignments occur.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward import statements and attribute assignments, establishing a namespace for various wiki text components. It does not process external input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. The structure is typical for a package's __init__.py or setup script, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. All signals indicate benign, organizational code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module initialization script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary.",
