{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up and configure a module related to processing or rendering wiki text, importing various components and assigning them to a namespace.",
  "sources": "The code reads module imports, attribute assignments, and references to external components within the module (e.g., _wikitext, internal class and function definitions).",
  "sinks": "Attribute assignments to _wikitext object, such as _wikitext.ExternalLink, _wikitext.WikiLink, etc., which modify or extend the module's namespace.",
  "flows": "Imports are assigned to local variables; then, these variables are assigned to attributes of the _wikitext object, linking internal components to the module namespace.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious code structures are present. The code mainly performs module setup and namespace configuration. No network activity, system modifications, or external data leaks are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard module setup: importing components, assigning them to local variables, and then attaching them to the _wikitext namespace. The structure is straightforward and aligns with typical Python module organization. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, dynamic code execution, or backdoors, is observed. The purpose appears to be organizing internal components for external use. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a typical module setup script, organizing internal components for external access. No malicious intent or security risks are detected.",
