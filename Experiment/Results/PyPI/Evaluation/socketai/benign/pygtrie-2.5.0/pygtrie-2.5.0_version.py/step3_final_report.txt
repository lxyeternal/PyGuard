  "purpose": "Utility script to determine the current version of a Python package, using 'git describe' output or a stored version file, and updating the version file as needed.",
  "sources": "Reads from subprocess output of 'git describe' and from the '.version' file.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is written or transmitted beyond local file I/O and subprocess calls.",
  "flows": "Source: 'git describe' command output or version file; Sink: version string returned and possibly written to '.version'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad 'except:' blocks which can mask errors; no malicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard version management tasks: invoking 'git describe' via subprocess, validating output with regex, reading/writing a version file. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or obfuscation is present. Exception handling is broad but common in such scripts; it does not introduce security risks. Regex validation helps prevent malformed data issues. Overall, the script is a legitimate utility with minimal security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version management utility with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The existing reports correctly identify its safe nature. The minor concern about broad exception handling does not impact security. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting minimal risk.",
