  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes standard build and documentation commands, reading files, subprocess calls.\n- **Sinks:** Subprocess 'sphinx-build', file operations.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No suspicious activity; subprocess call is standard; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Routine build script, no malicious behavior, malware score 0, risk 0, confidence 1.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above, with emphasis on version retrieval and file reading.\n- **Sinks:** External commands, file operations.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No suspicious secrets; subprocess usage is typical.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard build script, no malicious activity, malware 0, risk 0.2 (due to external command invocation), confidence 0.95.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Package setup, documentation build, version info.\n- **Sinks:** Subprocess, file operations, setup function.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No secrets or obfuscation; subprocess is standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical setup script, no malicious intent, malware 0, risk 0.2, confidence 0.9.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, focusing on version handling and documentation.\n- **Sinks:** Subprocess, file operations.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No suspicious activity, standard practices.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate setup script, malware 0, risk 0, confidence 0.9.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Package distribution, documentation, file handling.\n- **Sinks:** Subprocess, file operations.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard build script, malware 0, risk 0, confidence 1.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity. Given the code's purpose, the malware score should remain at 0.\n- **Security risk:** Slight potential concern with subprocess calls (risk 0.2 in some reports) due to external command execution, but this is standard for documentation building and not inherently malicious. Overall, the risk remains low.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and readable.\n- **Risk score:** Given the standard nature of the script, a conservative but justified score would be **0.1 to 0.2** to account for subprocess calls, but not higher.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is a typical setup and build script for a Python package. It performs version management, file handling, and documentation building using standard practices. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The overall malware score should be **0**, obfuscated score **0**, and a low security risk score (~0.1–0.2) reflecting the use of subprocess for documentation build.\n\n**Final estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to account for subprocess calls, but not malicious)",
