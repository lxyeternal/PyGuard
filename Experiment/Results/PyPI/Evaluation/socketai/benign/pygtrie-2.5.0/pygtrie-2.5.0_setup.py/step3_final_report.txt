{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a setup and build script for a Python package, managing versioning, documentation building via Sphinx, and file operations for packaging.",
  "sources": "File reads for version info and README, subprocess call to 'sphinx-build', and file write operations for version updates.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess execution for documentation build, file system modifications, and version file updates.",
  "flows": "Source data (version info, README content) flows into file operations and subprocess calls; version info is read and updated, documentation is built via subprocess.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Subprocess calls are standard for documentation building.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical package setup tasks: reading version and README files, invoking 'sphinx-build' for documentation, and managing version info files. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity are present. The subprocess call is used for documentation purposes, which is common and safe. File handling is straightforward, with proper error handling. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are observed. Overall, the code is well-structured, legitimate, and aligns with standard Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate, standard Python package setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The subprocess call to 'sphinx-build' is routine for documentation generation. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score should be 0. The obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is negligible.",
