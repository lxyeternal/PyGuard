  "purpose": "Manage TorchServe lifecycle (start/stop), handle subprocess output, and register models via HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "Subprocess stdout, function parameters for commands, HTTP request parameters",
  "sinks": "Subprocess execution, HTTP POST requests to localhost",
  "flows": "Parameters -> subprocess commands; subprocess stdout -> threading queues -> print/log; HTTP params -> POST request",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity; command construction appears standard",
  "analysis": "The code manages TorchServe processes via subprocess, using threading and queues to handle output, and registers models through HTTP POST requests to localhost. No malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration are present. The subprocess commands are parameterized and do not incorporate untrusted input directly. Threading and queue management are standard. No obfuscation or secrets are detected. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the benign, operational nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard management utility for TorchServe with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. No modifications are necessary.",
