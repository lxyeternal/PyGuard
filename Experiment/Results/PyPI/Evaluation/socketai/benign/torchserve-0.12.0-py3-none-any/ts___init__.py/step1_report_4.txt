{
  "purpose": "This module appears to initialize and configure a model server with endpoints for inference and status checks.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version information from a local module named 'version'.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks in this snippet; no untrusted data processing or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from importing 'version' to setting '__version__' based on that import; no other data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no hardcoded credentials, environment variables, or suspicious behavior. It solely imports and sets a version variable.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local 'version' module and assigns its '__version__' attribute to a global variable. The comments suggest the module is part of a larger application that starts a model server and creates endpoints, but no such logic is present here. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscated code. The code appears standard and benign, serving as a configuration or initialization snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign, serving as a simple version assignment with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is likely a part of a larger codebase responsible for model server setup.",
