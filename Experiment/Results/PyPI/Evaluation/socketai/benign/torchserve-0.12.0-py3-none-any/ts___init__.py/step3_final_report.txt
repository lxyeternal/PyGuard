  "purpose": "Initialize module with version information and documentation for a model server setup.",
  "sources": "Import of the 'version' module and assignment of '__version__' from 'version.__version__'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static import and assignment only.",
  "flows": "Import of 'version' module → assignment to '__version__'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; minimal code, no obfuscation, no external data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module setup snippet with a docstring, importing a version module, and assigning '__version__'. It contains no functions, network calls, or data processing. The import is relative, typical for package versioning. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions indicate benign intent. The minimal code and documentation suggest this is a standard part of a larger package. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a version and documentation initializer. All reports correctly assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0. The slight securityRisk score in one report (0.1) is unjustified given the code's simplicity; it should be adjusted to 0 for consistency. Overall, the code poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
