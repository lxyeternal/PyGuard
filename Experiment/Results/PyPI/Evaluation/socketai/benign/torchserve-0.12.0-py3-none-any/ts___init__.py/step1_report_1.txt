{
  "purpose": "Module to start a model server, create endpoints, and expose status and description endpoints.",
  "sources": "Imports version from the same package/module",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data handling or external calls observed",
  "flows": "No data flow paths identified; mainly module metadata assignment",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no suspicious or unusual behavior, no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module docstring describing functionality, imports a version attribute from a relative module, and assigns it to __version__. There are no functions, data processing, or external interactions present. The code does not perform any I/O, network operations, or data handling that could be malicious. It appears to be a standard, benign initialization snippet for a server module.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard module setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
