  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code is a simple module with a docstring and a version import; no functional code or data flow.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None observed; the reasoning is sound.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — reasonable given the benign nature.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, no external data handling.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; only a docstring, import, and version assignment.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues; reasoning aligns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious behavior or security risk.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** Identical pattern; minimal code, no external interactions.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No flaws in reasoning.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n- **Justification:** No malicious or risky activity detected.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same minimal code, import, version assignment.\n- **Errors/flaws:** Slightly lower confidence (0.9) and a small securityRisk score (0.1), but justified given the minimal code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — reasonable.\n- **Justification:** The small securityRisk score accounts for the very slight possibility that, in a larger context, such version imports could be part of a malicious package, but no actual malicious activity is observed here.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as others; no code behavior beyond version import.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct; the code is straightforward and transparent.\n- **Risk score:** All are at or near 0, with the only slight exception in report 4 (0.1), which is reasonable given the minimal code and the potential for version import issues in larger contexts.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code snippets and reasoning.\n- The minimal code and lack of suspicious behavior justify the low scores.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk:** 0 — no security risk evident.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate and justified. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately.",
