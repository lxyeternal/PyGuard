  "purpose": "Provides a brief overview and initialization for a model server module, including version information.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing the 'version' module from the current package.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no external network or data handling in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The source (import) leads to setting a module-level variable (__version__). No flow to external sinks observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is minimal, mainly documentation and version assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a docstring explaining the module's functionality, an import statement, and a version assignment. No input/output handling, no external data, and no complex logic. The import is relative, importing version info which is typical for package versioning. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation. The code is straightforward and standard for package initialization.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a basic module initializer with versioning. No malicious or suspicious activity detected.",
