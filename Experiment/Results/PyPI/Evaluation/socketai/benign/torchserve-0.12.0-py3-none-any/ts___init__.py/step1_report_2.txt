  "purpose": "Documentation and setup for a model server that creates endpoints and handles inference requests.",
  "sources": "Importing version module, accessing version information.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows involving untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow is observed; code mainly defines metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of comments describing server functionality and a single import statement for the version module. It assigns the version to __version__, which is typical for package metadata. There are no input sources, no data processing, no network connections, or potentially malicious code. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present. The code appears to be a simple module initialization with documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily documents and sets version info for a model server. No security issues detected.",
