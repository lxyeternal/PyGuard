  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the reported issues, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Code Summary:**\nThe code is a minimal module that:\n- Contains a docstring describing the server's purpose.\n- Imports a `version` module from the same package.\n- Sets `__version__` to `version.__version__`.\n\n**Assessment of the Code:**\n- No functions, data processing, or I/O.\n- No external network calls, data handling, or untrusted inputs.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n- The import is a standard pattern for versioning.\n- The code appears to be a benign, standard initialization snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior, no data flows, no anomalies.\n- **Score:** malware=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Comments:** Fully consistent with the benign nature. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, just documentation and version assignment.\n- **Score:** malware=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Comments:** No concerns; scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Similar minimal code, no external data or network activity.\n- **Score:** malware=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Comments:** Consistent with benign code.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Slightly lower confidence (0.9) and a small securityRisk (0.1), but based on the code, these are overcautious.\n- **Score justification:** The code is very simple, with no signs of malicious behavior. The minor securityRisk might be due to the import, but that alone isn't risky.\n- **Recommendation:** Both scores should be 0, matching the other reports.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as others, straightforward version import.\n- **Score:** malware=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Comments:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Consistency and Justification:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- The malware score is correctly 0 in all cases.\n- The security risk score should be 0 across the board, as there's no indication of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n- The minor difference in report 4's scores appears to be an overcautious default; given the code, both should be zero.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Adjust Report 4's scores:** Set `malware=0` and `securityRisk=0` for consistency.\n- **Overall assessment:** The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a straightforward, safe module initialization snippet with no security concerns.",
