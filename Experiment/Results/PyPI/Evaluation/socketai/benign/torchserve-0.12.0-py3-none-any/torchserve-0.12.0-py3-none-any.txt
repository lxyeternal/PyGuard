      "confidence": 1,
      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe CLI argument parser with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The slight security risk score (0.1) assigned in some reports is justified by potential misconfiguration but does not indicate any actual threat."

      "conclusion": "The script is a standard process management utility for TorchServe with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The moderate security risk stems from external input handling without explicit sanitization, which is typical in such scripts but warrants standard security practices. Overall, the code is safe and benign."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a version and documentation initializer. All reports correctly assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0. The slight securityRisk score in one report (0.1) is unjustified given the code's simplicity; it should be adjusted to 0 for consistency. Overall, the code poses no security threat or malicious intent."

      "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard deployment orchestration tool with no evidence of malicious activity. The low malware score (0) is appropriate, but the moderate security risk score (around 0.3) reflects the inherent supply chain risks due to reliance on external repositories and scripts. To mitigate risks, validation of external sources and checksum verification are recommended."
