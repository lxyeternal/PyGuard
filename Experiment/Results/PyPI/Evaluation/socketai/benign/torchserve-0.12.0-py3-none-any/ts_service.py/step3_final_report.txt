{
  "purpose": "This code implements a model inference service wrapper that processes incoming request data, manages context, handles exceptions, and generates prediction responses.",
  "sources": "Request batch data, request headers, environment variables, external configuration files",
  "sinks": "Prediction function call, response creation, logging outputs",
  "flows": "Input batch data is decoded and organized into headers and input batches, passed to the prediction entry point, and responses are generated based on the output or exceptions",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; exception handling is broad but standard",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical inference wrapper that processes untrusted input, manages context, and handles exceptions such as MemoryError, PredictionException, and CUDA errors. It decodes headers and parameters cautiously, logs metrics, and constructs responses accordingly. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code's structure and behavior are consistent with standard deployment practices, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured ML inference service component with no indicators of malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate given the handling of untrusted input but no active threats.",
