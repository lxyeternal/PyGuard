  "purpose": "Load the version information of TorchServe from a file named 'version.txt'.",
  "sources": "Reading the file 'version.txt' located in the same directory as the script using open()",
  "sinks": "The open() function potentially reads untrusted data if the file contents are manipulated or placed maliciously.",
  "flows": "File path resolution via Path(__file__).resolve().parent -> os.path.join -> open() reading 'version.txt' -> __version__ assignment",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious operations detected. The code straightforwardly reads a version file.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a file path to 'version.txt' relative to the script's directory and reads its contents into the __version__ variable. This is standard for version management. There are no signs of malicious activity such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The only point of concern could be if 'version.txt' is tampered with externally, but that is outside the scope of this code snippet. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code simply reads a version number from a local file, with no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard implementation for version retrieval.",
