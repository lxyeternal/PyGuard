{
  "purpose": "Load the version information of TorchServe from a file named 'version.txt'.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'version.txt' file located in the same directory as the script.",
  "sinks": "The code reads data from the local filesystem; no direct sinks for untrusted data or network communication are present.",
  "flows": "The code constructs a file path based on the script's location and reads its contents to assign to __version__.",
  "anomalies": "The code reads a version string from a file without validation; however, this is standard practice for versioning. No suspicious or malicious activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports os and pathlib modules, constructs a path to 'version.txt' relative to the current file, and reads its contents into __version__. No user input, environment variables, or network communication is involved. No obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward version loader for TorchServe, with no malicious intent or security issues. It simply reads a version string from a local file.",
