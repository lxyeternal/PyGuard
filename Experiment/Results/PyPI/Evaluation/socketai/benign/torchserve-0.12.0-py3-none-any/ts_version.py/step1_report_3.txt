  "purpose": "Load the version information of TorchServe from an external file.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'version.txt' file located in the same directory as the script.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no data leaks or untrusted data handling evident.",
  "flows": "Reads content from 'version.txt' and assigns it to __version__.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code resolves the current script's directory, constructs a path to 'version.txt', and reads its content into the __version__ variable. It uses standard library functions with no dynamic execution or external network connections. No input validation or complex logic present. Overall, the code performs a simple file read operation with no indications of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely reads a version string from a local file and assigns it to a variable. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code is straightforward and safe.",
