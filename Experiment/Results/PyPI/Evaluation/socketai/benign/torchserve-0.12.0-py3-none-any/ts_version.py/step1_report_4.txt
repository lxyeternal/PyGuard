{
  "purpose": "Load the version information of TorchServe from a file named 'version.txt' located in the same directory as the script.",
  "sources": "Reading from the file system: 'version.txt' in the script's directory.",
  "sinks": "None directly; no output or external data manipulation occurs that could lead to data leaks or other security issues.",
  "flows": "The code reads the version file and assigns its contents to __version__, without processing or transmitting the data elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "The code straightforwardly reads a local file without any validation, but this is typical for version info. No suspicious or unusual operations are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a path to 'version.txt' based on the script's location, then opens and reads its contents into the __version__ variable. No user input, network activity, or execution of untrusted code is present. The approach is standard for loading version info. No malicious behavior or malicious intent is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign snippet for loading version information from a local file. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security issues. It appears safe.",
