{
  "purpose": "Read version information from a local 'version.txt' file located in the same directory as the script.",
  "sources": "The code constructs a path to 'version.txt' in the script's directory and opens it for reading.",
  "sinks": "The code reads data from the local file; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted externally.",
  "flows": "Construct path -> open file -> read content -> assign to __version__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward file read operation with no validation or external communication.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple, standard operation of reading a version string from a local file without any user input, network activity, or code obfuscation. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. There are no suspicious patterns, malicious behaviors, or security vulnerabilities present. The only minor concern is if 'version.txt' is tampered with externally, but that is outside the scope of this code snippet and not a security flaw inherent in the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward implementation for loading version info from a local file. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
