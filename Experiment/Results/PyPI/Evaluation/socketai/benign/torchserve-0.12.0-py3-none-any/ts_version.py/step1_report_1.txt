  "purpose": "Load and expose the version information of TorchServe from a text file.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'version.txt' file located in the same directory as the script.",
  "sinks": "Reading from the file system to assign version information; no untrusted data handling or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "The code constructs a file path, reads the content of 'version.txt', and assigns it to __version__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward file reading operation with no hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code resolves the current script's directory, constructs a path to 'version.txt', and reads its content into a variable. No user input, network access, or untrusted data handling is present. The operation appears purely informational, typical for version management. No malicious or suspicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply reads a version string from a file to set a version variable. It does not perform any malicious activity or security-sensitive operations.",
