  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard deployment orchestration tool with no evidence of malicious activity. The low malware score (0) is appropriate, but the moderate security risk score (around 0.3) reflects the inherent supply chain risks due to reliance on external repositories and scripts. To mitigate risks, validation of external sources and checksum verification are recommended."
