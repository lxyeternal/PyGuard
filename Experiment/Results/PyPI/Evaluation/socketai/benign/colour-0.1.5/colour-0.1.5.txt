      "conclusion": "The module is a legitimate, well-structured color utility library that uses hashing for deterministic color generation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal risk score of 0.1 reflects the benign use of hashing for fingerprinting or visualization purposes."
