  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package, including dependencies and package management tools.",
  "sources": "Imports of 'setuptools' and 'multiprocessing'; package setup parameters.",
  "flows": "Import statements and setup configuration data flow for package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated behavior. The code is a standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and conditionally imports 'multiprocessing' to avoid potential issues in older Python versions. It then calls 'setuptools.setup()' with parameters specifying dependencies and PBR configuration. All code appears to be standard for package setup; there are no suspicious functions, code injections, or malicious data flows.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical package setup script with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It follows common patterns used in Python packaging without any anomalies or malicious behavior.",
