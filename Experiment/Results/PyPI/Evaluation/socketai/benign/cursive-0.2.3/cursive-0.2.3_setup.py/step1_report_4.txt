  "purpose": "Configure the Python package setup using setuptools with specific requirements and workarounds.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'setuptools' and 'multiprocessing'; setup configuration parameters in 'setuptools.setup()'.",
  "sinks": "None present; setup configuration is static and does not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; import and setup calls are static.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard package setup script, importing 'setuptools' and optionally 'multiprocessing' to ensure compatibility. The setup() function is called with static arguments to specify requirements. There are no dynamic or runtime evaluations, no external data inputs, and no indications of malicious intent. The code is well-documented and follows common package configuration patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign package setup configuration with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It appears to be a legitimate part of package management infrastructure.",
