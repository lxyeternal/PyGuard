  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools, with specific handling for Python versions and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Import statements for setuptools and conditional import of multiprocessing.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or user input; configuration calls to setuptools.setup() are safe.",
  "flows": "Import statements flow into the setup() call, which executes package setup procedures.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code; standard license comments, benign import handling, and straightforward setup call.",
  "analysis": "The code contains license comments, standard import statements, and a try-except block to import multiprocessing to avoid issues in older Python versions. The setup() function from setuptools is called with specified requirements. No signs of hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior. The code appears to be standard boilerplate for package setup, managed externally, and contains no suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup configuration script with no malicious intent, obfuscated code, or security risks. It is standard boilerplate used in Python packaging, with no suspicious behavior detected.",
