  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard Python package setup script.\n- No report indicates any suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- The code involves typical import statements, a try-except block for compatibility, and a call to `setuptools.setup()` with specified requirements.\n- Comments are standard and document licensing and maintenance details.\n- No data flows, sinks, or sources related to untrusted data are present.\n- The code does not perform any dynamic code execution, network activity, or access sensitive data.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed findings:\n- The code matches the original code provided.\n- No issues are present in the code.\n- All reports are consistent in their assessment: benign, standard setup scripts.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- No errors or flaws are evident in the code or the reports.\n- The reasoning in each report is sound and aligns with the code's behavior.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n\n### Score assessments:\n- The malware scores are all zero, correctly reflecting the absence of malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated scores are zero, as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- The security risk scores are zero, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since there is no malicious or suspicious behavior, a risk score higher than 0.5 is unwarranted.\n- The code is a standard setup script, used widely in open source projects.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the code is static and well-understood.\n- The comments about licensing and dependency management are standard and do not introduce security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or revision is necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments and scores are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
