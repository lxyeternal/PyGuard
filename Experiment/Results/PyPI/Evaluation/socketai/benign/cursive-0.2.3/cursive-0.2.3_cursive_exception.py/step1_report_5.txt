  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the Cursive project with formatted messages and internationalization support.",
  "sources": "Import from cursive.i18n for translation functions, class attributes, and constructor parameters.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "Input from constructor parameters flows into exception message formatting but remains internal; no external data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior observed. Exception message formatting is standard, and there are no obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured exception hierarchy with customizable messages, internationalization support, and safe exception handling. No data leaks, malicious behavior, or security issues are detected. The exception classes use string formatting with provided kwargs but do not perform unsafe operations. The usage of try-except around message formatting ensures robustness but does not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of custom exception classes with internationalization. No malicious or security-risk behavior is present.",
