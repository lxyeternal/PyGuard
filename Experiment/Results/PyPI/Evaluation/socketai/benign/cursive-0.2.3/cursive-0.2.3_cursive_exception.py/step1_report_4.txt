  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the Cursive project with formatted messages.",
  "sources": "Import of the _ function from cursive.i18n, class attributes, and constructor parameters.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is used in a way that leads to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "Constructor uses message formatting with kwargs, but only within exception handling, no external or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; standard exception class implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a base exception class and a derived exception with message formatting, leveraging a translation function. No inputs, network calls, or data leaks are present. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code execution, or backdoors are detected. The usage of message formatting appears safe and standard for exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign exception class implementation for a Python project, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
