  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Functionality & Logic Confirmation:**\n   - The code defines two custom exception classes (`CursiveException` and `SignatureVerificationError`) that support message formatting and internationalization.\n   - No external data sources, network calls, or system modifications are present.\n   - The message formatting uses class attributes and kwargs, with error handling to fallback if formatting fails.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are evident.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is standard exception handling with internationalization support.\n   - They note that no untrusted data is processed or leaked, and no suspicious behavior is detected.\n   - The analysis is consistent with the code.\n\n3. **Scores Review & Justification:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The security risk scores are also 0, aligning with the absence of vulnerabilities.\n   - Confidence levels are high (mostly 1.0), which is justified given the straightforward code.\n\n4. **Potential Risks & Assumptions:**\n   - The only minor concern could be if the message formatting used untrusted data, which could potentially lead to information leaks or formatting errors. However, in this code, the message formatting is controlled and only uses provided kwargs, with exception handling.\n   - No evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n5. **Consistency & Reasonableness of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's benign nature.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n6. **Overall Personal Estimate:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0, as no malicious behavior is detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0, code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0, standard exception handling with no vulnerabilities.\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exceptions with internationalization support. The reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign, with no malicious or security issues.\n- The scores are justified and should remain as they are.\n- No further action or concern is warranted.\n\n**My recommended scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0",
