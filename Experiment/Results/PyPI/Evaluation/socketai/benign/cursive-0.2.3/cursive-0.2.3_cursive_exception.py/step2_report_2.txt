  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and the reasoning.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Defines a base exception class `CursiveException` with customizable, internationalized message formatting.\n- Defines a subclass `SignatureVerificationError` with a specific message format.\n- Uses string interpolation with `msg_fmt % kwargs` inside `__init__`.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or obfuscated code.\n- No hardcoded secrets or malicious constructs.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code is straightforward and correctly implements custom exceptions with message formatting.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n\n### Logical flaws or anomalies:\n- The only potential concern is the use of string interpolation (`%`) with `kwargs`. If `kwargs` contains untrusted data, this could lead to unintended message content or, in rare cases, injection if the message is later used insecurely (e.g., displayed in a web context). However, in this code, the formatted message is only stored in the exception object and not directly outputted or executed elsewhere.\n- The `try-except` block in `__init__` gracefully handles formatting errors, defaulting to `msg_fmt`, which is safe.\n\n### Score assessments:\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation (`0`).\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly identify no malware (`0`).\n- **Risk:** Since the code is standard exception handling with no malicious intent, the overall security risk is effectively zero. The reports assign a score of `0` or close, which seems appropriate.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- The code does not perform any network activity, file I/O, or system modifications.\n- No external data is processed in a way that could cause security issues.\n- The message formatting is internal and controlled, with exception handling for formatting errors.\n- No malicious payloads or backdoors are present.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores given (mostly 0 or 0.95) are reasonable.\n- The highest confidence score (1.0) in most reports aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- No adjustments needed based on the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall, this code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exceptions with internationalization support.**\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate; the code is benign, and the scoring reflects that. No malicious or security concerns are evident.",
