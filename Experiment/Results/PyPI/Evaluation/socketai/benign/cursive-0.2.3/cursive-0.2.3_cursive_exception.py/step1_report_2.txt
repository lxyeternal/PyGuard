{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the Cursive project with formatted messages.",
  "sources": "The code reads from imported modules ('cursive.i18n') and class properties, particularly 'msg_fmt' and 'kwargs'. No external untrusted input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "Exception message formatting and storage, which could potentially leak information if combined with external data, but no external data is processed directly here.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow involving untrusted input; exception messages are generated from class properties and internal variables.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs. The code adheres to standard exception class patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two exception classes inheriting from Python's Exception. 'CursiveException' uses a message format string ('msg_fmt') and optional keyword arguments to generate error messages, and a method to format messages. 'SignatureVerificationError' is a subclass with a specific message format. There are no external input sources, no data leaks, no network activities, and no obfuscated code. The code appears purely to facilitate exception handling within the application, with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign exception handling implementation with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It performs typical class inheritance and message formatting for exceptions without any suspicious operations.",
