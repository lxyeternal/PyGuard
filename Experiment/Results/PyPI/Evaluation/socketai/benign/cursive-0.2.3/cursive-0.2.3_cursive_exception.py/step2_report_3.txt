  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully and cross-verify the code details:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes with message formatting and internationalization support. There are no indications of code anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The logic is standard, and no external data sources or sinks are involved that could lead to security vulnerabilities.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with high confidence scores (mostly 1.0). They correctly identify that the exception classes are standard, with safe message formatting, and no suspicious patterns. No errors or flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:  \n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is correct; there's no obfuscation.  \n   - **Risk Score**: All reports assign 0 or very close to 0, which aligns with the absence of security issues.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores**:  \n   Since the code is purely exception handling with message formatting, and no external data processing, network activity, or code execution, there is no justification for a risk score higher than 0.5. The code is safe.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**:  \n   The code does not perform any malicious actions—no data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The malware score should remain at 0.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code does not process untrusted input beyond internal message formatting and that the internationalization function `_()` is for translation, not malicious activity.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's nature. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0**  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0**  \n- **Risk Score**: **0** (or very close to 0, e.g., 0.1, but 0 is appropriate)\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exception classes with internationalization support. It does not contain any malicious or security-risk behavior. The reports are accurate, and their scoring aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the reports' conclusions.**",
