  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the Cursive project with formatted messages.",
  "sources": "Import from cursive.i18n for internationalization, class attributes, and __init__ method with optional message and kwargs.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processing or output streams vulnerable to injection or leaks.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (message, kwargs) flow into exception message formatting and storage, but no external data flows or untrusted sinks are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns. Exception handling is standard; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two exception classes with customizable messages. It uses internationalization for message formatting, with fallback handling for formatting errors. No external data sources, network operations, or system modifications are present. No obfuscated or suspicious constructs are used. Overall, the code implements standard exception handling without malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of custom exceptions for a Python project. It contains no malicious behavior, security issues, or suspicious anomalies. The exception classes are designed to provide formatted error messages with internationalization support. Overall, it is safe and benign.",
