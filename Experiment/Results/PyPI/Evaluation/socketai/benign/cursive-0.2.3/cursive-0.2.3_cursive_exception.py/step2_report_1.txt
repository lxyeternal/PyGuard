  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Verification:**\n   - The code defines two exception classes: `CursiveException` and `SignatureVerificationError`.\n   - Both classes use message formatting with `msg_fmt` and `kwargs`.\n   - No external data sources, network calls, or system modifications are present.\n   - No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are evident.\n   - The code appears to be a standard, benign implementation of custom exceptions with internationalization support.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward and standard.\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n   - The reports are consistent in their conclusion that the code is benign.\n   - No misinterpretations or overlooked issues are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The `obfuscated` scores are 0 or 0.0, aligning with the lack of obfuscation.\n   - Security risk scores are 0 or very close to 0, which is justified.\n   - Confidence levels are high, reflecting a clear understanding of the code's benign intent.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Score Justification:**\n   - Since no malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or suspicious behaviors are detected, a malware score of 0 is justified.\n   - The code's purpose is to handle exceptions, with no external data processing or security-sensitive operations.\n   - The use of internationalization (`_`) does not introduce risk, assuming the translation functions are safe.\n\n5. **Challenging Assumptions:**\n   - The reports assume the message formatting is safe, which is reasonable given the context.\n   - No assumptions about hidden malicious behavior are made; the code is transparent.\n   - The only potential concern could be if `kwargs` contained untrusted data, but since this is an exception class meant for internal use, this is not a security issue.\n\n6. **Overall Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No anomalies or suspicious patterns are overlooked.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**My own estimate aligns with the reports:**\n\n- The code is safe, benign, and standard.\n- No adjustments needed to the reported scores.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a typical implementation of custom exception classes with internationalization support, free of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.",
