{
  "purpose": "Support cryptographic signature verification for images, ensuring data integrity and authenticity.",
  "sources": "Signature data, hash method, key type, certificate UUID, certificate retrieval from key manager.",
  "sinks": "Verification process using cryptography libraries; no data leaks or external effects observed.",
  "flows": "Decode signature -> retrieve certificate -> validate key type -> create verifier -> verify signature.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Logging is standard and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard cryptographic signature verification, utilizing established libraries and proper exception handling. It retrieves certificates securely, validates key types, and creates verifiers accordingly. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. The external dependencies and key management interactions are typical for such functionality. The low risk scores across reports are justified, and no anomalies or vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured cryptographic signature verification module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate, and the overall assessment confirms its safety for production use.",
