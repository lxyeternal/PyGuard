  "purpose": "This code supports signature verification for images, involving cryptographic operations such as signature decoding, public key retrieval, and signature verification using various algorithms and key types.",
  "sources": "Reading image properties (img_signature, img_signature_hash_method, img_signature_key_type, img_signature_certificate_uuid), retrieving certificates from key manager, decoding base64 signatures.",
  "sinks": "Public key operations, cryptographic signature verification functions, certificate retrieval, and data decoding, which process untrusted image metadata and certificates.",
  "flows": "Image properties (sources) are used to determine if verification is needed; if so, signature is decoded, hash method and key are obtained; public key retrieved from key manager; verifier created and used for signature verification.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious network connections, no obfuscated code. The code properly handles exceptions and uses standard cryptography libraries. It performs typical cryptographic signature verification tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code performs cryptographic signature verification using standard libraries and practices. It retrieves certificates from a key manager, decodes base64 signatures, and verifies signatures with specified algorithms. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are detected. It correctly handles exceptions and validates input data types and formats. There are no hardcoded secrets or network operations that could indicate malicious activity. The use of established libraries and adherence to standard cryptographic procedures suggest this code is intended for secure verification, not malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of cryptographic signature verification with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It relies on external libraries and key management systems appropriately. There is no evidence of sabotage or malware within this code segment.",
