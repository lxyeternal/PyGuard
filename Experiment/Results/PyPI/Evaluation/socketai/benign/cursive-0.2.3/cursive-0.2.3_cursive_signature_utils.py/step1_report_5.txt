{
  "purpose": "The code provides support for signature verification of images, including handling cryptographic keys, certificates, and various algorithms, primarily for ensuring data integrity and authenticity.",
  "sources": "Reading inputs includes: image properties (signature, hash method, key type, certificate UUID), base64-encoded signature data, and certificate data retrieved from key manager.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include: creation of cryptographic objects (public keys, certificates), verification processes via verifiers, and network interactions through key manager API calls.",
  "flows": "Source: image properties (signatures, hash method, key type, certificate UUID) -> get_signature and get_hash_method functions -> get_public_key and get_certificate functions -> create verifiers (RSA, ECC, DSA) -> verification process",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code. Use of external libraries is typical for cryptographic operations. Logging is standard. No unusual code patterns or backdoors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly handles cryptographic signature verification: decoding base64 signatures, retrieving certificates from a key manager, validating key types, and constructing appropriate verifiers based on signature key type. It performs standard cryptographic validation with no apparent malicious intent. No data leaks, no network calls beyond key retrieval, and no suspicious behavior detected. The structure aligns with typical security practices, and no anomalous or malicious code segments are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured cryptographic signature verification module with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It performs expected operations for ensuring image integrity using cryptography without any signs of sabotage or malware.",
