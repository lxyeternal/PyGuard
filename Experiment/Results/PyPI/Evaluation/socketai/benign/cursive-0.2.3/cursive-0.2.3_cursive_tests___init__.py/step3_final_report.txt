  "purpose": "Analyze open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, modules like sys, os, requests, subprocess, eval/exec calls, network requests, file writes, environment modifications.",
  "sinks": "Network requests, file system, subprocess calls, environment variables, system commands.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input/env vars → processing functions → sinks like network, file, system commands.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), suspicious imports, unvalidated data handling, hidden network connections.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits patterns of potential malicious activity, including dynamic code execution, obfuscation, and insecure data handling. Suspicious imports and hardcoded secrets further increase concern. The absence of code in some reports is correctly identified as non-assessable. The reasoning aligns with security best practices, assigning moderate malware (0.4), obfuscation (0.6), and risk (0.6) scores where suspicious patterns are present. No false positives are evident, and the scores are consistent with the described behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The reports correctly identify the presence or absence of malicious patterns. The scores assigned are appropriate and reflect the level of suspicion. Minor adjustments could be made to the security risk score in some cases, but overall, the assessments are accurate and justified.",
