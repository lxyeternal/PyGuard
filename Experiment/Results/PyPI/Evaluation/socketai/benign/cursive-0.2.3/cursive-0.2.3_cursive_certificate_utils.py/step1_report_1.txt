  "purpose": "This code provides support functions for validating X.509 certificates, including checking validity dates, verifying issuer relationships, signing capabilities, and building certificate chains.",
  "sources": "Reading certificate objects, their extensions, and signature data for validation and verification.",
  "sinks": "Verification functions that verify signatures and chain integrity, which could be manipulated if malicious certificates or signatures are provided.",
  "flows": "Certificate data is read from input, then passed to verification functions that check signatures, issuer relationships, and validity dates. Chain building flows from the certificate to its signing certificates, verifying chain integrity.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No suspicious network activity or data leakage. The code relies on external inputs (certificates) but does not show signs of malicious manipulation within this snippet. No obfuscation or obfuscated code features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard cryptographic validation tasks: checking validity periods, verifying issuer signatures, and building trust chains. It uses external certificate inputs and performs signature verification with appropriate cryptography primitives. All functions seem aligned with legitimate certificate handling processes. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The functions depend on external certificates which could be malicious if provided by an adversary, but this is expected in a certificate validation context. The code's structure and logic appear standard for cryptographic verification, with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This module implements standard cryptographic certificate validation routines without any apparent malicious behavior. It handles certificate chain building and signature verification responsibly. No indicators of malware, sabotage, or malicious intent are present within this code snippet.",
