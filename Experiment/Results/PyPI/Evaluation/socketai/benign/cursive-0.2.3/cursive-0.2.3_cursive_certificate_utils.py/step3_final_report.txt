{
  "purpose": "The code implements standard cryptographic certificate validation routines, including date checks, issuer verification, signature verification, chain building, and extension validation.",
  "sources": "Reads certificate objects, certificate extensions, and signature data from cryptography library objects.",
  "sinks": "Uses cryptography primitives for signature verification; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Certificate data flows from input objects through validation functions, signature verification, and chain construction processes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs routine cryptographic validation steps consistent with best practices. Functions handle date validity, issuer relationships, signature verification with multiple algorithms, chain building, and extension checks. Exception handling is appropriate, and no malicious or obfuscated patterns are present. The logic is clear, well-structured, and relies on standard cryptography libraries, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, trustworthy implementation of X.509 certificate validation routines. No malware, sabotage, or malicious behavior is evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose and structure.",
