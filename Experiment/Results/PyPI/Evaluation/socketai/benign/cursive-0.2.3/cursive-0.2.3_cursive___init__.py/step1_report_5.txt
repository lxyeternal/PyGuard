  "sources": "Importing pbr.version and accessing VersionInfo for 'cursive'.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Import pbr.version -> Instantiate VersionInfo -> Assign version string to __version__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code follows standard practice for version retrieval in Python packaging.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a well-known package 'pbr' to manage versioning information. It simply assigns a version string to __version__ by querying pbr's VersionInfo for the package 'cursive'. There are no user inputs, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The code appears straightforward and intended for package version management without any suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version retrieval snippet used in Python packaging. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
