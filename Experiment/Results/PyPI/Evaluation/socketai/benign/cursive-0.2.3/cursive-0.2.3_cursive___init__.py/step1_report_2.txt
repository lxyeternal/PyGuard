  "purpose": "To define and set the version string for a Python package named 'cursive'.",
  "sources": "Import of pbr.version and the assignment of __version__ using pbr.version.VersionInfo.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or user input sources; no data leaks or harmful effects are evident.",
  "flows": "Import of version info leads to setting __version__, which is a static assignment based on package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears to follow standard package versioning practices. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a well-known library 'pbr' for version management and sets the package's version string. The code is minimal, straightforward, and does not perform any runtime actions beyond setting the version. There are no suspicious behaviors, obfuscated code, or malicious activities observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard versioning setup for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
