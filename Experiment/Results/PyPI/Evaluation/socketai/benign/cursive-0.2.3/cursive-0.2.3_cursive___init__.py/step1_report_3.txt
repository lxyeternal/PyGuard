  "purpose": "Retrieve the version string of the package 'cursive' using the pbr library.",
  "sources": "Import statement for pbr.version, usage of pbr.version.VersionInfo to obtain version information",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data leaks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "Import pbr.version -> Create VersionInfo object -> Access version_string attribute",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward usage of a standard versioning library without obfuscation or hidden code",
  "analysis": "The code imports the pbr library's version module to retrieve version information for the package 'cursive'. It then assigns the version string to __version__, which is standard practice in Python packaging. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no hardcoded credentials, no network activity, or obfuscated code. The code is simple, clear, and uses standard library calls for version retrieval.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version declaration for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It merely retrieves and sets the package version using the pbr library.",
