  "purpose": "Retrieve the version string of the package 'cursive' using the pbr library.",
  "sources": "Import of pbr.version and access to pbr.version.VersionInfo('cursive')",
  "sinks": "Assignment to __version__ variable; no untrusted data flow or external output detected",
  "flows": "Code imports version info and assigns it to __version__, with no external or untrusted data flow",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed; standard version retrieval",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical package version declaration using the 'pbr' library. It imports 'pbr.version' and assigns the version string of the package 'cursive' to __version__. There are no input or output operations, no dynamic code execution, and no hardcoded credentials. The code appears to be standard and benign, serving only to declare the package's version.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. It is a typical pattern in Python packaging and contains no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
