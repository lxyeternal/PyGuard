  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n- The code is a minimal, straightforward implementation that imports the `pbr.version` library and retrieves the version string for the package `'cursive'`.\n- There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.\n- The logic is standard for Python packaging and version management.\n- No external inputs, network activity, or data leaks are involved.\n- The code appears benign and typical for its purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Accurate; retrieves version info using `pbr.version`.\n- **Errors or anomalies:** None.\n- **Scores:** All zero, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correct; defines `__version__` for the package.\n- **Errors or anomalies:** None.\n- **Scores:** All zero, consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Accurate; standard version retrieval.\n- **Errors or anomalies:** None.\n- **Scores:** All zero, appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correct; typical version declaration.\n- **Errors or anomalies:** None.\n- **Scores:** All zero.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correct; straightforward version assignment.\n- **Errors or anomalies:** None.\n- **Scores:** All zero.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Check of scores and justification:\n\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate; no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Security risk:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign analysis.\n\n**Note:** Since all reports uniformly indicate no issues, and the code is standard, I agree with their assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert judgment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a simple, standard version declaration in a Python package, with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No further action needed.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: **malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0**. The code is safe and standard for its purpose.",
