  "purpose": "Retrieve the version string for the 'cursive' package using pbr.version.",
  "sources": "Import of pbr.version and creation of VersionInfo object with 'cursive'.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to __version__, no untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "Import -> VersionInfo -> version_string() -> __version__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static version retrieval.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard version management library, creates a VersionInfo object for 'cursive', and assigns its version string to __version__. It contains no dynamic code, user input, network activity, or obfuscation. The logic is simple and typical for package versioning. No suspicious patterns, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version declaration using pbr. It poses no security risks or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and their scores are appropriate.",
