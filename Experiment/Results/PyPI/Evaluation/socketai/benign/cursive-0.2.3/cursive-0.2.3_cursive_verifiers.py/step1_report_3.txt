  "purpose": "Provide cryptographic signature verification wrappers for RSA, ECC, and DSA algorithms.",
  "sources": "Input data via the update() methods, which update internal hash objects.",
  "sinks": "Verification calls that verify signatures using public keys, based on the accumulated hash digest.",
  "flows": "Data input through update() methods → internal hasher updates → finalize digest → verify signatures with public keys.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious behavior, or unusual code structures. The code relies on standard cryptography library features and proper hash/digest handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three classes for signature verification: RSAVerifier, ECCVerifier, and DSAVerifier. Each class initializes with a signature, hash method, and public key, and uses the cryptography library to hash data incrementally via update() before final verification. No data leaks, no external network connections, and no suspicious code patterns are present. The implementation correctly employs cryptography best practices by hashing data before verification, utilizing standard library methods, and not executing untrusted input.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of cryptographic signature verification wrappers, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It leverages standard cryptography library features appropriately. There are no indications of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
