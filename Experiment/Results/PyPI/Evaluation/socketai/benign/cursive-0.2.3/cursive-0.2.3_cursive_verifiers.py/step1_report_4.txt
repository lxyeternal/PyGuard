{
  "purpose": "Provide cryptographic signature verification wrappers for RSA, ECC, and DSA algorithms.",
  "sources": "Inputs include signature, hash_method, public_key, padding (for RSA), and data passed to update methods.",
  "sinks": "Verification functions use the provided signature, digest, and cryptographic objects to verify signatures, which could be misused if inputs are malicious.",
  "flows": "Data is updated via the update() method into the hasher, then finalized and verified against the signature using public key objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are observed. The code relies on external cryptography objects; no obfuscation or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly wraps cryptographic verification processes for RSA, ECC, and DSA algorithms. It maintains standard practices such as hashing data before verification and using Prehashed where appropriate. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security violations are evident. The code does not perform network operations, data leaks, or any system modifications. It appears to be a standard implementation of cryptographic verification wrappers.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, standard implementation of cryptography verification classes. It does not contain malicious code, suspicious behaviors, or security flaws within this module. No malware or obfuscation detected.",
