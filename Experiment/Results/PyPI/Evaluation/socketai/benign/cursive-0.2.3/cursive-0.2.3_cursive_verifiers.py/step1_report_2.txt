  "purpose": "Provide wrapper classes for cryptographic signature verification using RSA, ECC, and DSA algorithms.",
  "sources": "Input data to the 'update' methods, which feed data into the hash functions.",
  "targets": "Verification methods that use the computed hash digest to verify signatures with provided public keys.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'update' method to the hash object, then from the hash digest to the verify method where it is checked against the signature.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior observed. The code strictly wraps cryptographic verification functions; no network or external I/O operations are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three classes for verifying digital signatures with RSA, ECC, and DSA algorithms. Each class initializes with a signature, hash method, and public key, and provides an 'update' method for streaming data into a hasher object. The 'verify' method finalizes the hash and verifies the signature against the digest. The implementation uses standard cryptographic library functions and patterns. No obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs are present. The code appears to serve as a straightforward cryptographic utility without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard cryptographic wrapper for signature verification with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It is well-structured, with no hidden or malicious logic. The overall security risk is minimal, and the code appears safe.",
