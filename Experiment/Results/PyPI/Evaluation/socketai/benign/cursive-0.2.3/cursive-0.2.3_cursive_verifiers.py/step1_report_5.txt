  "purpose": "Provide classes for cryptographic signature verification using RSA, ECC, and DSA algorithms.",
  "sources": "Input data through the 'update' methods for hashing.",
  "sinks": "Verification functions that could validate signatures; no external data sinks or network calls observed.",
  "flows": "Data is fed into hash functions via 'update', then verified against signatures with public keys.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors observed. The code appears straightforward and standard for cryptographic verification.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three classes for signature verification, each initializing with signature, hash method, and public key, and hashing data before verifying signatures. No external data sources or sinks involve untrusted input outside hashing and verification steps. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. Usage is standard for cryptographic signature verification. No anomalies or indicators of malicious intent found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of cryptographic signature verification classes. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate, well-structured component for verifying signatures.",
