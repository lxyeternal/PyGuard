  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure cryptographic verification utility with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security flaws. The existing reports' assessments are accurate, with malware scores of 0 and obfuscated scores of 0. The low security risk scores (~0.1) are appropriate given the context, reflecting minimal inherent risk in cryptographic wrappers. Overall, the code is safe and well-implemented."
