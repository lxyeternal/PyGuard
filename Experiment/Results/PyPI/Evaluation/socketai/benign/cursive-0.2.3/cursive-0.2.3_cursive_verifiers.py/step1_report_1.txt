  "purpose": "This code provides cryptographic verification classes for RSA, ECC, and DSA algorithms, wrapping the cryptography library to verify signatures using various algorithms.",
  "sources": "Input data is fed through the 'update' methods, which update the internal hash context.",
  "sinks": "Verification occurs in the 'verify' methods, which process the digest and perform cryptographic signature verification.",
  "flows": "Data is fed via 'update' methods into a hasher, then finalized in 'verify', which uses the cryptography library to verify signatures.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; the code relies on external cryptography library functions and does not perform any network I/O, data leakage, or malicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The classes encapsulate signature verification procedures using standard cryptography primitives. Each class initializes with signature, hash method, and public key, and maintains a hasher instance. Data is accumulated via 'update', and verification occurs in 'verify' by finalizing the hash and calling the library's verify method with the appropriate parameters. No suspicious logic, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present. The code appears to be a straightforward wrapper for cryptographic verification, with proper use of the cryptography library. There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, data leaks, or malicious code. The implementation adheres to common cryptographic patterns, with no insecure practices evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard cryptographic verification wrapper implementing RSA, ECC, and DSA signature verification. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The implementation is clear and aligns with best practices for using the cryptography library. Overall, it appears safe and legitimate.",
