  "sources": "No data input sources; static string in the code",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow or processing; only a comment",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, only a docstring comment, no suspicious or unusual code constructs",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single module-level docstring describing the package. There are no functions, classes, input/output operations, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or potential entry points for malicious activity are present. The code is benign and appears to be a placeholder or descriptive comment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, containing only a descriptive docstring with no malicious intent or security risks.",
