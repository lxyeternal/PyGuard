  "purpose": "Define regular expressions and predicates for identifying special, class-private, and private names in Python code.",
  "sources": "Regex patterns compiled for matching specific naming conventions: RE_SPECIAL, RE_CLASS_PRIVATE, RE_PRIVATE.",
  "sinks": "Lambda functions using regex match methods to evaluate name strings.",
  "flows": "Input name strings are tested against regex patterns via the lambda functions within applicable properties.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or backdoors present. The code strictly defines regex-based name classifications.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 're' module and defines three regex patterns for matching special, class-private, and private naming conventions. Each pattern is well-formed and documented. The ApplicableNameProperty tuples assign descriptive names and lambdas that evaluate whether a given string matches the pattern. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The functions are straightforward, intended for naming convention checks only. No suspicious or obfuscated code features are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of regex-based name classification without any malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and serves a clear, benign purpose.",
