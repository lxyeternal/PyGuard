{
  "purpose": "Define regular expressions and predicates to identify special, private, and class-private variable names following Python naming conventions.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's own string constants, regex patterns, and lambdas that match variable names against those patterns.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; it does not process external input or data that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "The code compiles regex patterns and defines functions that evaluate string names against these patterns, with no external data flow or untrusted input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code consists solely of pattern definitions and simple predicate lambdas. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up three regex patterns to match different naming conventions: special double-underscores, class-private double-underscore names, and single-underscore private names. Each pattern is used in a lambda function to determine if a given name matches. The code appears to be a straightforward utility for name classification without any data processing, external input handling, or suspicious operations. No security risks, malicious behavior, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for classifying variable names based on naming conventions. No malicious intent or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
