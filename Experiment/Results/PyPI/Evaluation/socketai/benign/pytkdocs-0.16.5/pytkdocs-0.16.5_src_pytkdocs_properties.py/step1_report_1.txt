  "purpose": "Define regular expressions and predicates for identifying special, private, and class-private Python names following certain naming conventions.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it defines static regex patterns and lambdas for matching naming conventions.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; it does not process untrusted data or perform I/O operations.",
  "flows": "The lambdas directly apply regex matching to input names; no complex flow or data transformation occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The regex patterns appear standard for name conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code only defines regex patterns for specific naming conventions (__special__, __class_private, _private) and applies them via simple lambdas. No data input, network operations, or external interactions are present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors are identified. The regex patterns are standard and serve as naming filters, which are common in Python code style checks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as utility definitions for name classification based on conventional Python naming schemes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
