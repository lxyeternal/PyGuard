{
  "purpose": "Defines regular expressions and predicates for identifying special, private, and class-private names in Python code.",
  "sources": "Regular expressions are compiled from static string patterns; the data sources are the code's own string literals and pattern matches.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows are present; the code only performs pattern matching on input names.",
  "flows": "The predicate functions (`lambda name: bool(RE_PATTERN.match(name))`) are source-to-sink flows, but they are safe as they only return boolean based on pattern matching.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures detected. The code solely defines patterns and predicates without side effects or external data access.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules (`re`, `typing`), compiles specific regex patterns for name validation, and defines simple predicate functions. All patterns are static, and functions only perform pattern matching. There are no dynamic code executions, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. The code's structure and purpose are straightforward and typical for such utility modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for pattern matching in Python names, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply defines regex patterns and corresponding predicate functions to classify names.",
