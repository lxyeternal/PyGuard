  "purpose": "Define regex patterns and predicates for classifying Python variable names based on naming conventions.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only defines regex patterns and lambdas for internal classification.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data flows; no sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the lambdas apply regex matches internally without external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, static, and pattern-based.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of three regex patterns matching specific naming conventions (__special__, __class_private, _private). The lambdas simply apply these patterns to names. There are no external inputs, data processing, or side effects. The patterns are standard and serve as utility functions for name classification. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or vulnerabilities are present. The code is static and safe, with no suspicious behaviors or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a utility for name pattern matching. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk features. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk should all be 0, with high confidence in this assessment.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
