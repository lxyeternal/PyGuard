{
  "purpose": "Defines regular expressions and predicates to identify special, private, and class-private naming patterns in Python identifiers.",
  "sources": "The code reads the entire module at import time, specifically the regex pattern compilations and the lambda functions within the ApplicableNameProperty tuples.",
  "sinks": "The code does not have any obvious sinks that process untrusted input or data; it solely defines patterns and simple match functions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the patterns are static and only used for matching identifier names.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward, defining regex patterns and properties.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 're' and defines three regex patterns for matching specific naming conventions: special, class-private, and private names. It then creates predicate functions to check these patterns against strings. The patterns are static and do not process external or untrusted data at runtime. The overall structure is clear and conventional, with no signs of malicious or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The module is a simple, safe utility for identifying naming patterns in Python code. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
