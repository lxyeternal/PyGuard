{
  "purpose": "The code provides mechanisms for loading and documenting Python objects, including modules, classes, functions, methods, and attributes, with support for various docstring styles and complex path resolution.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include module source code, object signatures, source lines, and attribute properties accessed via inspection, importlib, Path, and object attributes.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive sinks include access to source code, object signatures, module attributes, and file paths. These could leak source code or object details if misused, but are used here for documentation purposes only.",
  "flows": "Sources such as module source code and object signatures flow into parsing, documentation extraction, and object representation. Path resolution flows from string paths to imported objects, then through object inspection for documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are evident. The code uses standard Python introspection, import, and file reading mechanisms for documentation purposes. No obfuscated code, network communication, or system modifications are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is focused on object introspection, documentation extraction, and path resolution with no network, system modification, or external command execution. It uses standard Python libraries like inspect, importlib, Path, and pkgutil, all for legitimate purposes related to documentation and code analysis. No malicious patterns such as data exfiltration, command injection, or backdoors are detectable. The logic is straightforward and adheres to common practices for code introspection and documentation generation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate documentation and object inspection utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads. Its use of source code and attribute access is standard for its purpose.",
