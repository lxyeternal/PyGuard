{
  "purpose": "This module provides functions to serialize Python objects related to documentation into JSON-serializable dictionaries.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include inspect.Signature, inspect.Parameter, and object attributes such as annotation, description, name, etc.",
  "sinks": "The data is converted into dictionaries; no explicit sink involves untrusted data output or network transmission within the code.",
  "flows": "Input data (annotations, object attributes, signatures) flows through serialization functions, transforming into JSON-compatible dicts.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code uses regex for annotation parsing, which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs data serialization for documentation objects, converting annotations, parameters, signatures, and source info into JSON-compatible formats. It uses regex to interpret type annotations, replacing Union and ForwardRef patterns. No external data input handling or network operations are present. Functions are well-structured, and there are no signs of malicious payloads, data leaks, or obfuscated malicious code. All operations are read-only data transformations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured serialization utility for documentation objects. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain risks. There are no indicators of malware or security threats.",
