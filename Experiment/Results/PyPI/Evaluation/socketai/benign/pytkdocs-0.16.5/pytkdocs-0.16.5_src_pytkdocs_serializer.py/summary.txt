  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, safe serialization utility for documentation objects. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score of 0.2 is justified given the static, read-only operations and safe regex usage. Overall, the code is benign and poses no supply chain security threat."
