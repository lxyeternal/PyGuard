  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims, scores, and potential security implications.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same minimal code snippet: a module with a docstring, a future import, and an empty `__all__` list.\n- The code does not process input, output data, or execute any dynamic or malicious operations.\n- The reports consistently conclude that the code is benign with no security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. The code matches the descriptions: minimal, standard module setup, no suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  - `confidence`: all 1 — appropriate, as the code is straightforward.\n  - `obfuscated`: all 0 — correct, no obfuscation.\n  - `malware`: all 0 — correct, no malware detected.\n  - `securityRisk`: all 0 — correct, no security risk.\n\n### Critical analysis:\n- The reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- The risk scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n- The detailed reasoning in each report supports the conclusion that there are no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- No issues are present; the code is standard boilerplate.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** should remain **0**.\n- **Obfuscated score:** should remain **0**.\n- **Risk score:** should remain **0**.\n\n**Note:** Since the code is purely boilerplate with no dynamic or external interactions, there's no reason to assign any higher scores.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate and should not be adjusted.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports correctly identify the code as harmless boilerplate. No further action needed.",
