{
  "purpose": "Minimal boilerplate module setup with a docstring, future annotations import, and an empty __all__ list.",
  "sources": "No external inputs or data sources; static code with no dynamic or untrusted data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static code with no execution flow involving external data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, standard boilerplate with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module template with a docstring, a future import, and an empty __all__ list. It contains no functions, classes, dynamic code, or external interactions. All reviews correctly identify its benign nature, with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious elements. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are present, and the code does not process untrusted data or perform any operations that could lead to security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign boilerplate with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's straightforward nature. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
