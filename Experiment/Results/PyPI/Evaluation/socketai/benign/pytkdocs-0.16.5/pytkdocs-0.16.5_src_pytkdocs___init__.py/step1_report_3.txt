{
  "purpose": "The code is a minimal module for the 'pytkdocs' package, intended to load Python objects documentation.",
  "sources": "The only source is the import statement for __future__ annotations.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; no untrusted data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present in this minimal code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is very basic, with no hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or dynamic execution. The __all__ list is initialized but empty, which is typical and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "This code imports the __future__.annotations feature to enable postponed evaluation of annotations, which is a common practice. It defines an empty __all__ list, possibly as a placeholder for public API exports. There are no inputs, no outputs, no dynamic code execution, and no third-party dependencies other than the __future__ import. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, minimal setup code for a documentation tool. It shows no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
