  "purpose": "Define module metadata and import annotations for future compatibility.",
  "sources": "The module imports the __future__.annotations feature and defines an empty __all__ list.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks as the code only contains imports and variable declarations.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of a future import and a declaration of an empty list for __all__. No dynamic code execution, data handling, or external interactions are present. It appears to be a standard, benign module setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard boilerplate with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs basic module setup without any suspicious elements.",
