  "purpose": "Define the initial structure and metadata for the pytkdocs package, specifically setting up the module's exports.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could cause harm or leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink; the code only imports features and defines an empty list.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no suspicious or unusual constructs are present. The import from __future__ is standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code imports annotations for future compatibility, declares an empty list __all__ for module exports, and includes a docstring describing its purpose. There are no external inputs, no data processing, no code execution, no hardcoded credentials, and no suspicious behavior. The code appears to be a typical initial module setup with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a basic module setup for the pytkdocs package. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are detected.",
