{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define a Python module related to 'pytkdocs' for loading Python object documentation.",
  "sources": "The only source is the import statement 'from __future__ import annotations'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident as the code does not process any external or untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and contains no unusual or suspicious constructs, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a feature from __future__, which is a standard Python practice to enable postponed evaluation of annotations, and defines an empty list for __all__, indicating no explicit exports. There are no other operations, data handling, or dynamic code execution. The minimal nature of the code suggests no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign module initialization with no malicious behavior or security concerns.",
