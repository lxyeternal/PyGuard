{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an entry point for executing the 'pytkdocs' CLI application when run as a script.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via the 'sys' module; imports 'main' from 'pytkdocs.cli'.",
  "sinks": "The 'main' function is called, which likely processes command-line input; however, specific sinks depend on 'main's implementation.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments are read via 'sys', passed to 'main', which executes and returns an exit code.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated behavior detected. The code follows standard Python script entry-point pattern.",
  "analysis": "The script provides a standard '__main__' entry point, calling 'main' from 'pytkdocs.cli'. There are no suspicious code patterns, no dynamic code execution, or external data flows beyond typical command-line processing. The purpose is straightforward, facilitating CLI execution of 'pytkdocs'.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and standard for a Python CLI entry point. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues are evident. It simply delegates execution to the 'main' function of the 'pytkdocs' CLI module.",
