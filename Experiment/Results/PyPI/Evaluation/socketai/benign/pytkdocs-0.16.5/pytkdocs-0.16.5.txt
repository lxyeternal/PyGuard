      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign automation script for project management with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the risk score is appropriately low (~0.1), reflecting typical CI/CD operations without security concerns."

      "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, safe serialization utility for documentation objects. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score of 0.2 is justified given the static, read-only operations and safe regex usage. Overall, the code is benign and poses no supply chain security threat."

The minimal security risk score of 0.1 reflects the standard stdout suppression pattern, which is acceptable and not malicious."
