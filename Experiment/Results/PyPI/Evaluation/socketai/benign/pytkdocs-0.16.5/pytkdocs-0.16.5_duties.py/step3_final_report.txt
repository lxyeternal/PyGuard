{
  "purpose": "The code automates development tasks such as testing, building, documentation, release, and deployment, primarily by executing external commands and managing environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., CI, MULTIRUN, DEPLOY), files (e.g., CHANGELOG.md), user input during release, and external command invocations via ctx.run().",
  "sinks": "External commands executed through ctx.run() which may process environment variables or user input; no network communication or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables, files, and user input into command execution functions; no untrusted data directly influences critical security-sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected; code structure is straightforward and standard for automation scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script performs routine project management tasks using standard tools and environment variables. It reads configuration files, executes commands, and manages environment states. No malicious payloads, obfuscated code, or suspicious data flows are present. External command execution is controlled and typical for CI/CD workflows. User input during release is standard and handled appropriately. Overall, the code demonstrates safe, conventional automation practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign automation script for project management with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the risk score is appropriately low (~0.1), reflecting typical CI/CD operations without security concerns.",
