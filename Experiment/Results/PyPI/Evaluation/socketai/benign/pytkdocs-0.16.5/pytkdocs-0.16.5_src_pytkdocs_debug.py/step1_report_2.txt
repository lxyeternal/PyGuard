  "purpose": "This code provides utilities for debugging and environment introspection, including retrieving Python version, installed packages, environment variables, and platform details.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (os.environ, os.getenv), system information (sys, platform), package metadata (importlib.metadata).",
  "sinks": "Printing functions that output environment and system info, which could leak sensitive environment variables or system details if executed in untrusted contexts.",
  "flows": "Reads environment variables and package info as sources, then outputs this data through print statements as sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code structures. The code primarily reads and displays system info, with no evidence of malicious data transmission or malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily gathers system and environment information using standard libraries and displays it. It includes functions to retrieve package versions, environment variables, and system details. The data flow involves reading environment variables and package metadata (sources) and printing this data directly (sinks). There are no indications of data being sent over the network or stored maliciously. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or hidden malicious logic are present. The code is straightforward and intended for debugging purposes, not malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a utility for environment debugging. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It simply reads system data and prints it, which could be sensitive if misused, but in itself poses no security threat.",
