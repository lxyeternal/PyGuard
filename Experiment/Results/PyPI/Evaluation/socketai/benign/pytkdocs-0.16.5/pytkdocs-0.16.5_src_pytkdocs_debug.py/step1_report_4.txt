{
  "purpose": "The code provides utilities to gather and print debugging and environment information about the current Python runtime, installed packages, and environment variables.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (os.environ), system information (platform, sys), and package metadata (importlib.metadata).",
  "sinks": "Print statements that output environment, system, and package information to standard output.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are collected from os.environ and os.getenv; package versions are retrieved via importlib.metadata; the data is assembled into Environment object and printed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code uses standard libraries for environment inspection and does not perform any network, file, or system modification actions.",
  "analysis": "The script defines data structures for environment variables, packages, and overall environment info. It retrieves interpreter details, installed package versions, and environment variables starting with 'PYTKDOCS'. It then formats this data into an Environment object and prints it. No code injections, backdoors, or malicious actions are present. The only potential concern is the collection and printing of environment variables, but these are filtered and not sensitive credentials. The code operates purely in a debugging context with no external communications or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign debugging utility that collects system and environment information and outputs it. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or contain malware indicators. It is safe in the context of supply chain security.",
