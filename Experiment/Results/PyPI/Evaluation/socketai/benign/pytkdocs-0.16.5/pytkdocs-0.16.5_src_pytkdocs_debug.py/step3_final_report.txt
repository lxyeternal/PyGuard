  "purpose": "Collects environment information including interpreter details, installed packages, environment variables, and platform, then outputs this data for debugging purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables via os.environ and os.getenv, retrieves package versions via importlib.metadata, accesses sys.executable and sys.implementation, and platform information.",
  "sinks": "Print statements outputting system info, environment variables, and package data to stdout.",
  "flows": "Source: environment variables and system info; Sink: print statements outputting data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code; straightforward data collection. No obfuscation or hardcoded secrets. The only potential anomaly is printing environment variables, which could leak sensitive info if misused, but filtering mitigates this.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard debugging utility that gathers environment details using safe, standard Python modules. It filters environment variables starting with 'PYTKDOCS' to reduce leakage risk. No network activity, code injection, or malicious behavior is present. The print statements are typical for debugging but could expose sensitive info if run in untrusted environments. The code structure is clear, with no obfuscation or hidden logic. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk between 0.1 and 0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code, considering the minimal risk of info leakage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign environment inspection utility with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The only minor security concern is potential info leakage via environment variables, which is mitigated by filtering. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
