{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to gather and display debugging and environment information about the current Python interpreter, installed packages, and environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variables accessed via os.environ and os.getenv; system information via platform and sys modules.",
  "sinks": "Printing to standard output (print statements), which could be observed by an attacker if output is captured or redirected.",
  "flows": "Data from environment variables and system modules flows into Environment object, then is printed out via print_debug_info().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. No unusual dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. The code reads environment info and displays it without modification or external network communication.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and defines dataclasses to structure environment info. It retrieves interpreter details, installed package versions, and environment variables. The get_version() function attempts to read package versions, and get_debug_info() consolidates environment data into a structured object. print_debug_info() outputs this data to the console. No external network access, no handling of untrusted inputs beyond environment variables, and no suspicious code patterns detected. All data handling appears benign, intended for debugging purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a benign debugging utility, collecting system and environment information and printing it out. There are no signs of malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks within this code segment.",
