{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to gather and display debugging and environment information about the Python interpreter, installed packages, and environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variables accessed via os.environ and os.getenv, system information from sys and platform modules, package version info from importlib.metadata.",
  "sinks": "Printing output to console; no data is sent over network or written to files.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read and stored in variables; package versions are fetched and stored; information is formatted and printed to the console.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns observed. The code straightforwardly collects and prints system info; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and defines data classes to organize environment info. Functions extract interpreter details, package versions, and environment variables. The information is compiled into a structured Environment object and printed. All data access is limited to reading system environment and package info, with no external network communication or data manipulation beyond display. The code’s purpose aligns with debugging utilities; no malicious intent or malicious code segments are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign debugging utility designed to collect and display system environment information. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It operates solely within the local environment and uses standard libraries.",
