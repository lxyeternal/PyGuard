{
  "purpose": "This module provides class definitions for representing Python objects, modules, classes, functions, methods, attributes, and source code for documentation and analysis purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input via function parameters, class initializers, and properties such as docstrings, source lines, and file paths. No external untrusted input sources are explicitly used.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include attribute assignment (e.g., self.source, self.docstring), import statements, and file path operations. No untrusted data is explicitly written to external systems or network.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (like docstrings, source lines, file paths) into object properties. The `parse_docstring` method processes the docstring with an external parser. File paths are used for relative path calculations. No untrusted data is directed outside the system.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard class definitions and utility functions for static analysis. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. No unusual code patterns or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple classes modeling Python code elements with standard properties and methods. The `Source` class wraps source lines; the `Object` class manages hierarchical relationships and docstring parsing; subclasses specify particular object types. The code uses safe imports, standard library functions, and clear data flows. No signs of malicious or suspicious code, such as network operations, data exfiltration, or malicious logic, are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical static analysis helper module for documenting and analyzing Python code structure. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and intended for use in documentation or code introspection tools.",
