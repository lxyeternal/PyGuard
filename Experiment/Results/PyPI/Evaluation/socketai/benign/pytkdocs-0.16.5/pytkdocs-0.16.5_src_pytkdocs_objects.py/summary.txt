  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured implementation for representing Python code objects and source code, with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the minimal risk score (0.1) is justified due to standard dynamic path and module handling, which pose no active threat."
