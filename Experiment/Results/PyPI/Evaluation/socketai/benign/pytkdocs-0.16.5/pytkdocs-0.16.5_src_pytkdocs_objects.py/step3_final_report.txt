  "purpose": "Defines classes for representing Python objects, source code, and their hierarchy, primarily for documentation and static analysis.",
  "sources": "Internal parameters, source code retrieved via inspect, importlib, and file paths.",
  "sinks": "Module imports (`importlib.import_module`), filesystem path manipulations (`Path.relative_to`), and source file retrieval (`inspect.getabsfile`).",
  "flows": "From class attributes and source code parameters to module import functions and filesystem paths.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, suspicious code, or malicious patterns detected; standard static analysis patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for modeling Python objects and source code, utilizing standard libraries for introspection. No external data sources or network activity are present. The use of dynamic import and path handling functions is typical for such utilities and does not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are observed. The slight risk score (0.1) assigned in some reports reflects potential misuse if inputs are untrusted, but within this static context, the code is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured implementation for representing Python code objects and source code, with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the minimal risk score (0.1) is justified due to standard dynamic path and module handling, which pose no active threat.",
