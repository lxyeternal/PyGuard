  "flows": "importlib.import_module -> Path/inspect.getabsfile -> sys.modules",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. No unusual code behaviors or obfuscated constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides class definitions to model Python objects such as modules, classes, functions, methods, and attributes. It includes methods for parsing docstrings and managing hierarchical relationships. The only external interactions involve importing modules dynamically and accessing file paths for source code retrieval. These are standard operations for code introspection and do not execute untrusted code or perform malicious actions. No network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications are present. The code structure appears straightforward, with no obfuscated logic, suspicious dynamic code execution, or malicious payloads. Overall, it is a typical reflection/introspection utility with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of object modeling and source code introspection for Python modules. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It performs no harmful actions and is primarily designed for documentation or analysis purposes.",
