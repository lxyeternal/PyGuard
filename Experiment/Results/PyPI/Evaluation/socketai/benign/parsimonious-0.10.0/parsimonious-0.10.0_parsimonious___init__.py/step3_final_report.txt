{
  "purpose": "Import statements for exceptions, grammar classes, node visitors, and rules from the 'parsimonious' library, serving as a public API interface.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from 'parsimonious.exceptions', 'parsimonious.grammar', and 'parsimonious.nodes' modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code only imports modules without data handling or output.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code does not process data or execute functions, only imports modules.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; straightforward static imports.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from a well-known parsing library. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing occurs. The imports are standard for exposing API components. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and clarity support a benign assessment. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static set of import statements from the 'parsimonious' library, with no malicious intent or security risks. The current scores are justified, and no changes are necessary.",
