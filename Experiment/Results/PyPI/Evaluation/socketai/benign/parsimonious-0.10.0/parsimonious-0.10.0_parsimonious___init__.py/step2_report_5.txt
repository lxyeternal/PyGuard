  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements from the 'parsimonious' library.\n- No dynamic code execution, data processing, network activity, or untrusted input handling is present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n- The code is standard for exposing API components of a library.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The actual code matches the descriptions in all reports.\n- The imports are straightforward, and there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n- None detected. All reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n\n**Scores and their appropriateness:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, which aligns with the straightforward import statements.\n- Security risk scores are 0, consistent with the absence of any malicious or suspicious activity.\n- Confidence levels are 1, indicating certainty about the benign nature.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n- Since all reports are uniform and correct, no adjustments are necessary.\n- The overall risk and malware scores should remain at 0, with no suspicion.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a standard API import module for the 'parsimonious' library.\n- There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is safe, benign, and typical for a library setup.",
