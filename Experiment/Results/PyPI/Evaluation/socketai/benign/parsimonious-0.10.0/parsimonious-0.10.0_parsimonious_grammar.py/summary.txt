  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured parser framework for PEG grammars with no malicious activity or sabotage detected. The only minor security consideration involves evaluate_string, which should be trusted or sandboxed. Overall, the security risk is very low, and the current scores are appropriate."
