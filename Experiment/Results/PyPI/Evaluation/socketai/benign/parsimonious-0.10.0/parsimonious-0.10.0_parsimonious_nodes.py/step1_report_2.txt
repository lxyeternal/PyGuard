{
  "purpose": "Define classes and decorators for representing, traversing, and visiting parse trees generated by a parsing library.",
  "sources": "Input data is primarily the text fed into parsing functions, node data within parse trees, and method decorators for rules.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that process untrusted data in a harmful way are present; no network or system calls are evident.",
  "flows": "Text input flows into parsing functions, resulting in nodes; visitor methods operate on nodes; no external data or system effect flows are identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is well-structured, and no obfuscated or unusual language features are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of parse tree node classes and a visitor pattern using decorators. It includes properties for accessing node text, child nodes, and methods for pretty-printing and comparison. The Node and RegexNode classes manage parse tree data; NodeVisitor provides a mechanism to traverse and process parse trees with customizable visit methods. The rule decorator links grammar rules to visitor methods, constructing a default grammar for parsing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks; all operations are standard for parsing libraries. No external network, file, or environment manipulation occurs. The code is clean, using standard language features without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, standard implementation of a parse tree node system and visitor pattern for a parsing library. It contains no malicious, sabotage, or security-compromising features. Its purpose is to facilitate parsing and traversal of parse trees without any indication of malicious intent or harmful behavior.",
