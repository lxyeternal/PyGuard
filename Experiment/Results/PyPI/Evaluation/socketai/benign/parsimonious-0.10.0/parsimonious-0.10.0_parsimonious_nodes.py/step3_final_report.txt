{
  "purpose": "Defines parse tree nodes and a visitor pattern for processing parse trees, enabling traversal and transformation of parsed data structures.",
  "sources": "Reads input text for parsing, constructs nodes with text slices, and utilizes class methods for traversal; no external untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission, system modification, or network activity; purely internal data structure manipulation.",
  "flows": "Input text -> Node creation and parsing functions -> Visitor methods invoked on nodes -> Processed output or transformations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected; standard implementation of parsing utilities.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a set of classes for parse tree nodes and a visitor pattern to traverse and process these nodes. It uses standard Python features, no obfuscated code, and no external data flows or malicious patterns. The dynamic grammar creation via decorators is a common pattern in parser libraries, not malicious. No external or untrusted data handling, network activity, or system modifications are present. The code is a typical, benign parsing framework component.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of parse tree data structures and visitor pattern utilities. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores are consistent with this assessment.",
