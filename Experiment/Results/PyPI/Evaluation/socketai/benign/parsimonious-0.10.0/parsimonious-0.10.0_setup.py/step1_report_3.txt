  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the 'parsimonious' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading the README file for long description; no other external input sources involved.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; no runtime data processing or external outputs within this setup script.",
  "flows": "Read long description from file -> package setup configuration; no data flows involving untrusted sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. Usage of standard setup functions and straightforward package configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical package setup tasks using setuptools. It reads a README file with explicit encoding, defines package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, no external command invocations, nor obfuscation observed. All operations are standard for a Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears benign and standard for Python package configuration. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this code.",
