{
  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for the 'parsimonious' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' file, static package metadata, dependencies, and setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no sinks for malicious data or code execution.",
  "flows": "Static data flow from file reading to setup() invocation; no dynamic or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, well-structured setup script with no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script that imports standard modules, reads a README file with explicit encoding, and calls setup() with static, well-defined parameters. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is present. Multiple reviews confirm its benign nature, assigning malware and obfuscation scores of 0, with very low security risk scores (~0.1). The code follows standard packaging practices, and no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with its static, straightforward nature.",
