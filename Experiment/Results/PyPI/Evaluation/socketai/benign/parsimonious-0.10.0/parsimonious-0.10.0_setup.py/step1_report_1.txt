{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the 'parsimonious' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst' file for long_description, imports sys, io, and setuptools modules.",
  "sinks": "None that process untrusted data or user input; the code primarily performs package setup tasks.",
  "flows": "Reads description file -> passes data to setup() -> package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code; standard setup.py pattern. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, reads a description file, and calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No dynamic code execution, no suspicious network activity, no handling of untrusted input or sensitive data. It appears to be a typical setup script for a Python package. The code structure and usage conform to common Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
