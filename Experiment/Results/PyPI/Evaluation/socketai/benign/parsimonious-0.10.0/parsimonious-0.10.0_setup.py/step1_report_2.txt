{
  "purpose": "Configure and set up the 'parsimonious' Python package for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' file for long description; importing modules sys, io, setuptools; no user input or network data involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; setup configuration uses static data and package metadata.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows; static data is used for setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious behavior detected; straightforward setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and a third-party library (setuptools). It reads a README file with specified encoding, then calls setup() with static metadata including package info, author, dependencies, classifiers, and keywords. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The code adheres to typical package setup practices and contains no signs of obfuscation or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup configuration script for packaging a Python library. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe and appropriate for distribution.",
