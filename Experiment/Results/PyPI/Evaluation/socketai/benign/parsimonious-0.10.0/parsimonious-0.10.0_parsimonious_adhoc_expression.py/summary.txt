  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, safe utility for wrapping user-defined functions into parser expressions. No malicious behavior or obfuscation is present. The main security concern is the trustworthiness of supplied callables, not the code itself. The scores are consistent with this assessment, and no modifications are necessary."
