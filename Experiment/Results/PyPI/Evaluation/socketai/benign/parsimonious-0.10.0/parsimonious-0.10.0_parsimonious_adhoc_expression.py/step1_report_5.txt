{
  "purpose": "This code defines a function to create custom parsing expressions from callables for use in a grammar parsing framework.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the input parameters 'callable', 'rule_name', and 'grammar'. It also inspects the 'callable' object to determine its argument structure.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or external systems are present. The code does not perform network I/O, file operations, or other potentially dangerous actions.",
  "flows": "The 'callable' is invoked with text and position, and optionally with cache, error, and grammar, returning parsing results. The resulting 'Node' objects encapsulate parse results.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains normal parsing framework logic; no suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated constructs are evident. The use of introspection functions like 'getfullargspec' and 'ismethoddescriptor' is standard. No dynamic code execution (e.g., eval) or reflective calls are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up a class for custom expressions based on user-defined callables, verifying function signatures and adapting invocation accordingly. It does not perform or facilitate any external system interactions, network access, or malicious activities. No anomalies such as hidden code, obfuscated constructs, or malicious payloads are identified. The design aligns with standard parser extension practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate part of a parser framework for creating custom expressions. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The implementation is straightforward, with appropriate safeguards and no suspicious elements detected.",
