{
  "purpose": "Define a function to convert a callable into an Expression object within a parsing grammar, supporting custom rule logic.",
  "sources": "The function receives the 'callable' argument, which is a user-defined function intended for matching in text; the code also references 'grammar' and 'callable' within the inner class.",
  "sinks": "The callable is invoked with text and position, potentially with additional arguments; no external data or network calls are directly present. No sinks are evident where untrusted data is transmitted outside the scope.",
  "flows": "Input: 'callable', 'grammar'; flow to: invocation of 'callable' within '_uncached_match'; output: wrapped in Node object if applicable.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs are present. The code primarily constructs an expression class and calls a user-defined function. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious network activity are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to transform a user-defined matching function into an Expression object. It handles unbound method resolution, argument counting for input validation, and defines an inner class that calls the provided function during matching. The function's invocation is controlled and only involves passing text, position, cache, error, and grammar. There are no dynamic code executions, external system calls, or data leaks. The code appears straightforward, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility for creating grammar expressions with user-defined match functions. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The design is safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
