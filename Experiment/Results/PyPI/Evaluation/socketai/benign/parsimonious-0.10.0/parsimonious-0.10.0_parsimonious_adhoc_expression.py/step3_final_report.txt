{
  "purpose": "Convert user-defined callables into an Expression subclass for parsing, handling different function signatures and wrapping the invocation result into a Node.",
  "sources": "The callable function passed as an argument, invoked with text and position, and optionally with cache, error, and grammar.",
  "sinks": "The invocation of the callable during parsing; no external data transmission or system calls are present.",
  "flows": "The code calls the callable with specific arguments based on its signature; the result is processed and wrapped into a Node object.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward invocation and wrapping logic.",
  "analysis": "The code safely converts user-defined functions into Expression objects, handling unbound methods and argument counts. It invokes the functions with controlled parameters and wraps the results into Node objects. There are no external system calls, network activity, or data leaks. The primary security consideration is trusting the supplied callables, which could be malicious if untrusted. The code itself is simple, clear, and free of obfuscation or malicious payloads. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2-0.3) are appropriate given the context. Overall, the code is a safe utility for parser extension, with the main risk stemming from external trust boundaries.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, safe utility for wrapping user-defined functions into parser expressions. No malicious behavior or obfuscation is present. The main security concern is the trustworthiness of supplied callables, not the code itself. The scores are consistent with this assessment, and no modifications are necessary.",
