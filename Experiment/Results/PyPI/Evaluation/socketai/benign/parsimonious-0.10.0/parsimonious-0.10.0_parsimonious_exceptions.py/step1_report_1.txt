{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes for a parsing library, handling various parsing errors, and providing detailed error reporting.",
  "sources": "Input data is accessed through self.text in ParseError and related classes, specifically in methods like line() and column(), which analyze the position of errors within the text.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data is used in a manner that could cause data leaks or security effects. The code does not execute untrusted data, nor does it send data over the network.",
  "flows": "Error messages are constructed using data from the source (self.text) and the position (self.pos), then formatted into strings. No untrusted input is used beyond error reporting, which is generally safe.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward exception handling and string formatting, with no suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code implements exception classes for a parsing library, providing detailed error messages about parse failures, left recursion, incomplete parsing, and visitation errors. The use of self.text and self.pos to generate error locations is standard. No external network calls, file operations, or dynamic code execution are present. The classes do not handle or manipulate sensitive data or perform any security-critical operations. The overall structure is standard for error handling in a parser, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as an error reporting module for a parsing library. There are no indications of malicious intent, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities. It appears to be well-structured exception handling code with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
