{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for parsing errors and related issues in a parsing library.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or user input handling; the code mainly defines classes and methods for error reporting.",
  "sinks": "None detected; the code does not process untrusted data directly or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; primarily internal exception handling and string formatting.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward class definitions and error message formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes for handling parsing errors, left recursion, incomplete parses, visitation errors, and grammar issues within a parsing library. All methods involve string formatting and exception chaining. No user input, network operations, or data leaks are evident. The code does not perform any dynamic code execution, file operations, or malicious activities. It appears to be standard, well-structured error handling code for a parser. No signs of obfuscation, malware, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of exception classes for a parser library with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears safe and typical for error handling in parsing modules.",
