{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes and utility functions for parsing errors in a parsing library, primarily for error handling and reporting.",
  "sources": "The code reads static class attributes, instance attributes, and input parameters such as 'text', 'pos', 'expr', 'node', and 'exc'.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that process untrusted data; exception messages are formatted using safe string operations, and no data is sent over network or written to files.",
  "flows": "Input parameters like 'text' and 'node' are used to generate descriptive error messages; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior. It contains comments for future improvements, but no malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple exception classes related to parsing errors, such as ParseError, LeftRecursionError, IncompleteParseError, and others. These classes primarily store error context and generate descriptive error messages. The usage of string formatting, class attributes, and standard exception handling indicates typical application code for error reporting. No dynamic code execution, data exfiltration, or network activity is present. All code appears to be standard, well-structured exception handling for a parsing library, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of error handling classes for a parsing library, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard error message construction and class initialization without external data leaks or malicious behavior.",
