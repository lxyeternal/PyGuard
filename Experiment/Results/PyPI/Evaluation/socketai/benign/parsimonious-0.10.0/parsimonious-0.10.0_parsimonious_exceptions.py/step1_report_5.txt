{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for parsing errors and related issues in a parsing library.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; all data is internal or passed as parameters to exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data outputs present.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows identified; exception messages are generated from internal state variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code contains multiple custom exception classes for parsing errors, including ParseError, LeftRecursionError, IncompleteParseError, VisitationError, BadGrammar, and UndefinedLabel. These classes mainly handle error messaging and do not perform any external actions, network operations, or data manipulation beyond string formatting. The methods and constructors focus on reporting error states, with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. Usage of standard library functions like count, rindex, and string formatting are safe. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or malicious activities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of exception class definitions for a parsing library, with no malicious or security-threatening behavior. It appears to be a benign and standard implementation for error handling in a parser framework.",
