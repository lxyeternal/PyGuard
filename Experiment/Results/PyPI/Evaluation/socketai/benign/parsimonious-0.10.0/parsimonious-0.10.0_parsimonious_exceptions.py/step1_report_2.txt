{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for parsing errors and grammar issues in a parsing library.",
  "sources": "None; this code only defines classes and methods without input sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is processed or transmitted within this code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; there are no data flows from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behavior observed; no hardcoded credentials, network activity, or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code provides structured exception classes for a parsing library, including detailed string representations for errors. It uses standard Python features and imports. No external data or input processing occurs, nor are there any suspicious behaviors such as network access, code execution, or data leakage points. The classes are straightforward, mainly serving as error containers with formatted messages. No obfuscation or malware patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for a parsing library, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
