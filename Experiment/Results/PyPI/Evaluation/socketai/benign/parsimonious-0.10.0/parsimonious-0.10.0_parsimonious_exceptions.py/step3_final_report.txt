{
  "purpose": "Defines exception classes for parsing errors, including ParseError, LeftRecursionError, IncompleteParseError, VisitationError, BadGrammar, and UndefinedLabel, used for error reporting within a parsing library.",
  "sources": "Internal class attributes such as self.text, self.pos, self.expr, and node objects used to generate error messages and track error locations.",
  "sinks": "No external data input, network operations, or data leaks; error messages are generated from internal state only.",
  "flows": "Error classes construct descriptive messages from internal attributes; no external data flows or untrusted data processing beyond error reporting.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected; the code is straightforward exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions with methods to generate error messages based on internal state. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The methods like line() and column() parse self.text to locate error positions, which is standard. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is purely error reporting, and it does not handle untrusted data in a risky manner.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of exception classes for a parsing library, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
