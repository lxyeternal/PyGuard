  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their conclusions with the code content.\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n- The code defines multiple custom exception classes related to parsing errors.\n- It uses standard Python features: class inheritance, string formatting, and exception handling.\n- The methods primarily generate descriptive error messages based on internal state.\n- No external data processing, network activity, file operations, or dynamic code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The code appears to be straightforward error handling for a parsing library.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms the code is benign, with no malicious behavior.\n- Notes the use of `self.text` and `self.pos` for error location, which is standard.\n- No external data leaks or security issues.\n- **Malware score: 0** — appropriate.\n- **Risk score: 0** — appropriate.\n- **Confidence: 1** — justified.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar conclusion: standard exception classes, no suspicious activity.\n- No external data processing or malicious patterns.\n- **Malware score: 0** — appropriate.\n- **Risk score: 0** — appropriate.\n- **Confidence: 1** — justified.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Reiterates that the code is straightforward error handling.\n- No signs of malicious behavior or security risks.\n- **Malware score: 0** — appropriate.\n- **Risk score: 0** — appropriate.\n- **Confidence: 1** — justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same conclusion: no malicious activity, no external data handling.\n- Standard exception class definitions.\n- **Malware score: 0** — appropriate.\n- **Risk score: 0** — appropriate.\n- **Confidence: 1** — justified.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Consistent with previous assessments.\n- No suspicious code, no external data leaks, no malicious patterns.\n- **Malware score: 0** — appropriate.\n- **Risk score: 0** — appropriate.\n- **Confidence: 1** — justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, which is correct. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports agree on 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** All reports give 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**However, considering the purpose of the code (error handling classes), the scores are appropriate.** There's no indication of malicious intent, and the code does not process untrusted data in a dangerous way.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malware.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and readable.\n- **Risk:** 0 — standard error handling code with no security implications.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scores given in the reports are reasonable and justified based on the code content.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No changes are necessary. The code is safe, and the scoring reflects its benign nature.",
