  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured parsing library with no malicious features. The primary security concern is the potential for regex-based performance issues if patterns are maliciously crafted, but this is a known and manageable risk. Overall, the code is safe for use in trusted environments, assuming user functions and regex patterns are vetted."
