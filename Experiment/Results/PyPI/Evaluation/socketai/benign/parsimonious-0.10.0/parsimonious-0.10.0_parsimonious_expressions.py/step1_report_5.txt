{
  "purpose": "The code defines a parsing library with various expression classes for building and matching grammar rules, including literals, regexes, sequences, options, and lookaheads.",
  "sources": "Data is read from input text (via match and parse methods), token lists (in TokenMatcher), and regex patterns (in Regex). No external or untrusted data sources are explicitly used.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could potentially influence regex patterns or input text for matching, but the code does not contain code execution, network communication, or data leakage mechanisms.",
  "flows": "Input text flows into match and parse methods; regex patterns process text in Regex.match_core; custom callables (user-defined functions) may process data during expression evaluation; no external or network flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are present. The code appears to be a standard parser combinator implementation with no unusual or malicious behavior. The only dynamic behavior involves user-defined functions for custom expressions, which are expected in a parser library.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a framework for defining parsing expressions, including literals, regex, sequences, choices, lookaheads, and quantifiers. It performs typical parsing tasks with caching for efficiency and supports user-defined custom rules via callables. No network, file, or system modification code is present. The dynamic invocation of user-supplied functions is standard for parser libraries and does not indicate malicious intent. The regex handling and input processing are straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious logic. There are no hardcoded secrets or suspicious control flow structures.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical implementation of a parser combinator library. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. It operates solely on provided input and user-defined functions, which is expected. No malicious or maliciously intended features are evident.",
