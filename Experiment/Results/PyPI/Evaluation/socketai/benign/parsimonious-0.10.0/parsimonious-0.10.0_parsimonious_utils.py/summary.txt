  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious or suspicious elements. The use of ast.literal_eval() is safe for literal evaluation, assuming external validation. The reported scores are appropriate; malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is very low (~0.1). No modifications are necessary."
