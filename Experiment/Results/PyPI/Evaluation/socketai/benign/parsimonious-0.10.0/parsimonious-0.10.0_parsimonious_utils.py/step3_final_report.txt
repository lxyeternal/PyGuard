  "purpose": "Provides utility classes for string and token representation, and a safe string evaluation function using ast.literal_eval().",
  "sources": "Input strings passed to evaluate_string() for literal evaluation.",
  "sinks": "ast.literal_eval() function, which evaluates string literals; safe for literals but could be misused if inputs are untrusted.",
  "flows": "Input strings flow into evaluate_string(), then into ast.literal_eval(), returning evaluated Python objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward utility classes and a function that safely evaluates string literals. The use of ast.literal_eval() is appropriate and safe when inputs are validated externally. The Token class is simple, with no external dependencies or network activity. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The only potential concern is if external inputs are untrusted, but the code itself does not introduce vulnerabilities. Overall, the code is a safe utility module with minimal security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious or suspicious elements. The use of ast.literal_eval() is safe for literal evaluation, assuming external validation. The reported scores are appropriate; malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is very low (~0.1). No modifications are necessary.",
