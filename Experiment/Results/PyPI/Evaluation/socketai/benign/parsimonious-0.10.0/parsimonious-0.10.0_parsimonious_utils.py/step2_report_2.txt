  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides utility classes/functions; `evaluate_string()` uses `ast.literal_eval()`, which is safe for literals; `Token` class is simple.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. `ast.literal_eval()` is safe for literals, and the classes are straightforward. The low security risk score is appropriate, given the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing safe use of `ast.literal_eval()`, no external data sources, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies no malicious behavior. The security risk is minimal, consistent with the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates safe use of `ast.literal_eval()`, no anomalies, standard class definitions.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar conclusions; `ast.literal_eval()` is safe; no suspicious code.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 (slightly higher, but still low)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher security risk score, but still consistent with the benign code. No evidence of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above; safe use of `ast.literal_eval()`, straightforward classes.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Analysis & Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** All reports agree that the code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All report 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slight variations (0.1 to 0.2), but all very low, reflecting minimal concern.\n\n**Key points:**\n\n- The code relies on `ast.literal_eval()`, which is designed to evaluate only literals and is safe against code injection.\n- The classes are simple data containers with no external dependencies or network activity.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.\n- The code is clearly utility-focused, with no malicious intent.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0**, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at **0**, as code is clear.\n- **Risk score:** Given the low but non-zero scores, I would assign a **0.1** to **0.2** range, reflecting minimal security concern but acknowledging the potential risk of misuse if inputs are not validated outside this module.\n\n### Additional notes:\n\n- The use of `ast.literal_eval()` is appropriate and safe here.\n- If external inputs are fed into `evaluate_string()`, proper validation should be ensured outside this code to prevent misuse, but within this code segment, no issues are present.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Suggested Value | Justification                                              |\n|----------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0                       | No malicious code or behavior detected.                     |\n| Obfuscated     | 0                       | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation.                     |\n| Security Risk  | 0.1 - 0.2               | Very low risk; potential if inputs are malicious outside context. |\n\nThis conservative assessment aligns with the evidence and the consensus across reports.",
