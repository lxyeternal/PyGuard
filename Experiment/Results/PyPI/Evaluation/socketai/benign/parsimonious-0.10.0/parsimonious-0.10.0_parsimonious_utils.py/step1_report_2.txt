{
  "purpose": "Provide utility classes and functions for string evaluation and token representation in parsing scenarios.",
  "sources": "Input data is read through the 'string' parameter in evaluate_string(). No external data sources or inputs are used.",
  "sinks": "The evaluate_string() function uses ast.literal_eval(), which safely evaluates string literals but does not execute arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "Input string -> evaluate_string() -> ast.literal_eval() -> returns evaluated object.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The code uses standard Python features safely.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility classes and functions for string evaluation and token management, utilizing Python's ast.literal_eval for safe literal parsing. No external data sources, network activities, or system modifications are evident. The class structures and functions follow standard patterns without obfuscation or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module designed for parsing tasks. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is straightforward and safe.",
