{
  "purpose": "Provides utility classes and functions for parsing, including token representation and string evaluation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input strings and potentially user-provided string literals for evaluation.",
  "sinks": "The evaluate_string function evaluates string literals using ast.literal_eval, which is a safe method for evaluating string representations.",
  "flows": "Input strings are passed to evaluate_string, which uses ast.literal_eval to produce Python objects.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious patterns; use of ast.literal_eval is appropriate and safe; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility classes for string representation and token management, and a function to evaluate string literals. The evaluate_string function uses ast.literal_eval, a safe method for evaluating string literals, mitigating risks like code injection. No external data sources, network activities, or suspicious behavior are present. The code appears to be a straightforward utility module without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as utility functions and classes for parsing. No malicious or malicious-suspicious behavior detected.",
