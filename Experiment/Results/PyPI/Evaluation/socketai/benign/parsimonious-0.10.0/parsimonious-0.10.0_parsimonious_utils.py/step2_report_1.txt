  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report states the code is benign, with no malicious intent, and the use of `ast.literal_eval()` is safe assuming external inputs are validated outside this module.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (very low, consistent with the benign assessment)\n- **Comment:** The reasoning aligns with the code, which is straightforward utility code. No issues here.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, confirms the code is safe, with no external data sources or suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Comment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Reinforces the previous conclusions; no anomalies or malicious behavior detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Comment:** Consistent and justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; the use of `ast.literal_eval()` is safe, and the code is straightforward.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (slightly higher but still low, perhaps reflecting cautiousness)\n- **Comment:** Slightly elevated security risk score but still aligns with the benign nature.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Also confirms safety, with no suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1\n- **Comment:** Consistent with the overall benign assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Analysis and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Presence of issues in the code:** The code appears clean, straightforward, and uses standard Python features. No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or hardcoded secrets are present.\n- **Malware concerns:** The use of `ast.literal_eval()` is safe when used properly, as it only evaluates literals, not arbitrary code. No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The only potential concern is if external inputs are not validated before passing to `evaluate_string()`. However, the code itself does not process untrusted data directly; it just provides utility functions. Proper validation should be done outside this module.\n- **Scores consistency:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0. The security risk scores are very low, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (very low, consistent with utility code that could be misused if inputs are not validated outside this module)\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a benign utility module for string and token handling, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The use of `ast.literal_eval()` is safe within this context, assuming external validation of inputs. The reported scores are reasonable, but the overall risk score could be slightly lowered to 0.1, given the lack of any actual security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis reflects a benign, straightforward utility code segment with minimal security concern.",
