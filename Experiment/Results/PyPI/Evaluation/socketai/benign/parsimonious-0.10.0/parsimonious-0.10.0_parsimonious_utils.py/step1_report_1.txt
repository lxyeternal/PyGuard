  "purpose": "Provide utility classes and functions for string evaluation and token representation in parsers.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; functions and classes operate on input parameters and internal variables.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of ast.literal_eval() which could evaluate untrusted strings if misused outside this code context.",
  "flows": "Input string -> evaluate_string() -> ast.literal_eval() (possible evaluation of malicious input).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or backdoors; no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility classes and functions for string and token handling. The evaluate_string() function uses ast.literal_eval(), which is safe when used with trusted input, as it only evaluates literals. The Token class is a simple data container with no external dependencies or network activity. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leakage within this code segment. The code appears to be straightforward and intended for parsing utilities, with no dangerous operations or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for internal utility functions and classes, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. The use of ast.literal_eval() is safe within this context, assuming external inputs are validated outside this module.",
