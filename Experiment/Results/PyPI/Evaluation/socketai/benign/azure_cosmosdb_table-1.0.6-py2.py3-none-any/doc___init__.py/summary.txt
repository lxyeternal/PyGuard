  "conclusion": "Most code snippets are benign or incomplete, with minimal security risks. Dynamic execution and obfuscation features should elevate malware suspicion slightly. Adjusting the malware score for report 3 to 0.3 improves risk accuracy, aligning with potential exploitation concerns. The overall security posture remains low risk, but vigilance around dynamic code features is advised."
