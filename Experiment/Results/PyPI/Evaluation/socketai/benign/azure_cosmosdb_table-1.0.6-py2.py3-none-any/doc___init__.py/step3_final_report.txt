  "purpose": "Evaluate supply chain security of the open source Python dependency by analyzing code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, data processing functions, dynamic execution points ('exec', 'eval'), network/file sinks, input data sources.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, data processing functions that could leak or manipulate data.",
  "flows": "Input sources (environment variables, data inputs) to sinks (network, file, environment), potentially via dynamic execution or obfuscation.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of 'exec'/'eval', obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, suspicious environment variable usage, unusual data flows.",
  "analysis": "The code is mostly benign or minimal, with reports indicating no suspicious patterns. Dynamic execution and obfuscation are present in some reports, raising potential concerns. The scores assigned generally reflect the observed patterns, but the presence of dynamic execution suggests a higher potential risk. Adjustments are recommended: increase malware suspicion for code with dynamic execution and obfuscation from 0.2 to approximately 0.3, to better capture the potential threat. Other reports are consistent with their assessments. Overall, the code shows low malicious activity, but features like 'exec'/'eval' and obfuscation warrant cautious scoring.",
  "conclusion": "Most code snippets are benign or incomplete, with minimal security risks. Dynamic execution and obfuscation features should elevate malware suspicion slightly. Adjusting the malware score for report 3 to 0.3 improves risk accuracy, aligning with potential exploitation concerns. The overall security posture remains low risk, but vigilance around dynamic code features is advised.",
