{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a generic Python script with no clear specific purpose due to lack of comments or context, possibly a placeholder or template.",
  "sources": "Potential data sources include environment variables, input functions, and imported modules; however, no explicit data input sources are evident in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system commands are present in the code snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no apparent data flow paths from sources to sinks; the code mainly consists of variable assignments and function definitions without clear execution flow.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains unusual formatting with zero or minimal functionality, no comments, and appears incomplete. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious constructs are visible. The code structure is minimal, making it difficult to detect malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "Step-by-step analysis shows that the code lacks substantive logic, data handling, or system interactions. It does not utilize user input, external data, or network operations. The absence of dynamic or malicious code patterns suggests it is benign or a placeholder. There are no obfuscated elements, malicious behaviors, or security risks evident in the provided snippet.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit any signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears to be a minimal or incomplete script with no harmful intent. However, due to the limited content, confidence is moderate.",
  "confidence": 0.6,
  "obfuscated": 0,
