  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and suspicious activity based on provided summaries and code snippets.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, data processing functions, input/output points, potential data flows, and code constructs within the code fragment.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks via environment variables, network communication, or data processing functions; points where untrusted data could influence behavior.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or inputs to sinks like network connections or data storage, possibly involving dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "anomalies": "Any hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious data handling patterns.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the absence of code or lack of evidence for malicious activity. For reports with code, no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior are observed. The scores assigned—malware 0, obfuscated 0, low security risk—are consistent with the summaries. Confidence levels are moderate to high, reflecting cautious but justified assessments. No significant anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected. The reasoning aligns with the limited information, and the scores are appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided summaries and analysis, there is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks in the code. The assessments and scores are consistent and justified. No revisions are necessary; the overall security posture appears benign.",
