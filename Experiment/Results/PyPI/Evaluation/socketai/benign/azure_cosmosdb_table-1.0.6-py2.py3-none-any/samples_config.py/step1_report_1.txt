{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define configuration variables for connecting to a storage service, likely Azure Storage, based on the variable names and license.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading operations are present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the variables are statically assigned empty or boolean values.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded credentials (even if empty) such as STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME, STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY, and SAS. These are sensitive values typically used for authentication.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only variable definitions for storage credentials and a flag indicating emulation. The credentials are empty, which might be placeholder values, but hardcoded credentials are a security concern if they are populated with real secrets. There are no functions, input handling, or operations that could be malicious. The code itself is minimal and appears to be a configuration setup. The license header is standard and does not influence security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple configuration stub with placeholders for sensitive credentials. If these variables are replaced with actual secrets within the package, it could pose a risk if the package is distributed with embedded credentials. No malicious behavior is evident from this snippet alone, but hardcoded secrets are a security concern.",
