{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define configuration variables for accessing cloud storage, likely for use in a larger application that interacts with storage services.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded variables: STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME, STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY, SAS, IS_EMULATED",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive credentials could be used in storage access functions, but no such functions are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Data would flow from these variables into storage access operations, but none are shown here.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of empty strings assigned to sensitive credentials (account name, key, SAS token) which may indicate placeholders or insecure defaults; no actual malicious behavior is present in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code only declares configuration variables related to cloud storage credentials and flags. There are no functions, data handling, or network operations. The variables are placeholders and do not contain actual sensitive data. No suspicious or malicious code is evident. Since no actual logic or data flow is provided, this appears to be a benign configuration snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration setup with placeholders for sensitive credentials. There is no malicious behavior or security risk evident within this snippet. It appears to be part of a larger application setup.",
