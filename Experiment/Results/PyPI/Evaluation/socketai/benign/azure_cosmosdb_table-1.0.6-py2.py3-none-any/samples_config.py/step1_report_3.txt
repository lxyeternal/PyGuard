{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up variables for connecting to a storage account, likely for cloud storage interactions.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from hardcoded variables: STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME, STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY, SAS, and IS_EMULATED.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data such as STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY and SAS could be misused if exposed, but the code does not currently send or transmit data anywhere.",
  "flows": "Not explicitly present in the provided snippet, but the variables are likely used later in code that interacts with cloud storage services.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of empty hardcoded credentials (STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME, STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY, SAS) is unusual, though common in template or placeholder code. No malicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward declaration of configuration variables for a storage account. The variables are initialized with empty strings, indicating placeholders or configuration to be filled later. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code segments are present. The code does not perform any operations or data handling on its own. It is a typical setup snippet that could be part of larger storage interaction logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet contains placeholder variables for storage account credentials with no active malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a benign configuration template without signs of malware or security risks.",
