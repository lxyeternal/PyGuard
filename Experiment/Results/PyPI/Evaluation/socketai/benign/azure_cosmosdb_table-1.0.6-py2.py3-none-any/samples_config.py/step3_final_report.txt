  "purpose": "Configuration variables for Azure Storage account credentials, currently set as placeholders.",
  "sources": "Variables assigned static empty strings and a boolean flag; no data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; no untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or data processing; variables are static placeholders.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded credential variables initialized with empty strings, which is a security concern if later populated with real secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal configuration snippet defining storage account credentials with placeholder values. No functions, data flows, or malicious activities are present. The variables are intended for later use, but hardcoded secrets—even as placeholders—pose security risks if replaced with actual secrets. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. The security implications depend on how these variables are used; as-is, they are benign but highlight poor security practice if secrets are embedded later.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration template with placeholders for sensitive credentials. No malicious behavior or obfuscation is detected. The main concern is the insecure handling of secrets if replaced with real credentials, which could lead to security vulnerabilities. The current malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting moderate concern due to insecure practices but no active malicious activity.",
