  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration template with placeholders for sensitive credentials. No malicious behavior or obfuscation is detected. The main concern is the insecure handling of secrets if replaced with real credentials, which could lead to security vulnerabilities. The current malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting moderate concern due to insecure practices but no active malicious activity."
