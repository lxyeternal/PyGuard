  "purpose": "Define configuration variables for accessing a storage account, likely for use in storage operations.",
  "sources": "None, as the code only sets static variables.",
  "sinks": "None, no untrusted data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; variables are assigned static empty strings or boolean values.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hard-coded credential variables (account name, key, SAS token) with empty strings. No validation or encryption. These could be placeholders or uninitialized credentials.",
  "analysis": "The code declares variables for storage account credentials with no assigned values. These variables could be used elsewhere in the application for storage access. The empty strings suggest placeholders or uninitialized sensitive data. There is no code execution, data processing, or network activity in this snippet. The code by itself does not perform malicious actions but storing credentials in code is a security risk if these variables are used unencrypted or exposed.",
  "conclusion": "This code does not contain malicious behavior itself but indicates insecure handling of sensitive credentials through hardcoded variables. The actual risk depends on how these variables are used elsewhere. The snippet alone is not malicious but highlights poor security practice.",
