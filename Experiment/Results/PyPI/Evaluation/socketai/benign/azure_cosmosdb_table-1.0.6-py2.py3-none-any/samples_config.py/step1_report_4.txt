{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define configuration variables for accessing cloud storage, likely for an Azure storage account.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded variables: STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME, STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY, SAS, IS_EMULATED",
  "sinks": "Potential use in storage access functions or network calls that could transmit these credentials or use them insecurely",
  "flows": "Variables may be used as input to cloud storage operations or network requests that handle data or credentials",
  "anomalies": "Presence of empty credentials suggests incomplete or placeholder code; no direct malicious activity or suspicious code structures observed",
  "analysis": "The code initializes sensitive credential variables with empty strings, indicating they are placeholders for real secrets. No functions, network calls, or executable code are present. The pattern is consistent with configuration setup, not malicious behavior. The code itself does not perform any actions, nor does it contain obfuscated or malicious code. No hardcoded secrets are visible, and no suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a standard configuration placeholder for cloud storage credentials with no signs of malicious intent or security risk. It appears to be a part of a larger codebase where credentials would be populated securely at runtime.",
