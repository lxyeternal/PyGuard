  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a larger Python package, likely providing sample code or documentation for authentication and client operations.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .authentication and .client",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks observed; this is a simple import statement setup",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behavior detected; code is straightforward and standard",
  "analysis": "The code contains only license information and import statements from local modules, indicating a standard package structure. No input reading, no data transmission, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. It is typical boilerplate for a package's initial file, likely for documentation or example purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a standard import setup for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It does not perform any operations or data handling beyond importing modules.",
