  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code:**  \n   All reports consistently indicate that the code is merely importing internal modules with licensing comments. There are no functions, data processing, network activity, or any runtime behavior that could be malicious. The code snippets are trivial and serve as boilerplate or sample code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**  \n   The reports are accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no suspicious behavior, no data flows, and no security risks. No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**  \n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with the straightforward import statements and lack of obfuscation.  \n   - **Security Risk Score:** All are 0, aligning with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores:**  \n   Since there's no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerability, raising any scores above 0.5 would be unjustified. The code is clearly benign.\n\n5. **Challenging Assumptions:**  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as standard, non-malicious boilerplate.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**  \n   The scores are consistent across reports and with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Clear, straightforward import statements.\n- **Risk Score:** **0** — No security risks or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a simple, benign module import snippet with no malicious or suspicious elements. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk. No changes needed.",
