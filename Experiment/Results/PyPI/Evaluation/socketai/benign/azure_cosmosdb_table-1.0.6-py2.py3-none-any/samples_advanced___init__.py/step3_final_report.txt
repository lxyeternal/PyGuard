  "purpose": "This code snippet contains licensing comments and import statements for internal modules, serving as part of a larger package or sample code.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from licensing comments and import statements from '.authentication' and '.client' modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the licensing comments and import statements, but since there are no runtime data or user inputs, no flow to vulnerabilities exists.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward with licensing info and simple imports, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of licensing comments and two import statements. No functions, data processing, network activity, or malicious behavior are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with high confidence (1), no obfuscation (0), no malware (0), and no security risks (0). The scores are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code. No issues or vulnerabilities are detected, and the code does not perform any actions that could be malicious or insecure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import snippet with licensing comments, presenting no security risks or malicious activity. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified. No adjustments are necessary.",
