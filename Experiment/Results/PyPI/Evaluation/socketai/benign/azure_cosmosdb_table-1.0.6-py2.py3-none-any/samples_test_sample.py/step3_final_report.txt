{
  "purpose": "This code is a unittest suite that runs sample functions related to Azure Cosmos DB Table storage, primarily for testing or demonstration purposes.",
  "sources": "Configuration data imported from an external module (`samples.config`) containing credentials and settings.",
  "sinks": "Instantiation of `CloudStorageAccount` objects using credentials from config; no data leakage or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "Credentials from config are used to create storage account objects; no external data flows or malicious payloads.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or unusual behavior detected; straightforward test code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports configuration for credentials, instantiates storage accounts, and runs sample methods. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or data exfiltration is present. Handling of credentials via external config is standard in test code but requires secure management outside the code. No logical flaws or security issues are evident. Malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0; security risk is low (~0.2-0.3) due to credential handling but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for testing SDK samples, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The main concern is secure management of external configuration files containing credentials. The scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
