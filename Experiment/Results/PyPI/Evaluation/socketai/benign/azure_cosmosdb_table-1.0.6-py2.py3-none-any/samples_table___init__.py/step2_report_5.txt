  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - The code consists solely of licensing comments and import statements from local modules:\n     ```python\n     from .encryption_usage import TableEncryptionSamples\n     from .sas_usage import TableSasSamples\n     from .table_usage import TableSamples\n     ```\n   - There is no data processing, network activity, dynamic code execution, or handling of untrusted input.\n   - The code appears to be part of a larger package, likely for documentation, testing, or sample purposes.\n\n2. **Security and Malicious Behavior**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that there are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - The import statements are straightforward and do not involve any suspicious patterns or external data sources.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no anomalies are present.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward import statements.\n   - **Security Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Issues**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - The purpose of the code is clearly benign, and the reasoning aligns with the code's content.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - Given the simplicity and benign nature of the code, I agree with the reports' conclusions.\n   - No changes are necessary in the scoring or analysis.\n\n6. **My Own Estimation**:\n   - **Malware**: 0\n   - **Obfuscated**: 0\n   - **Risk**: 0\n\n**Final notes**:\n- The code is a standard import block with licensing comments, typical for open-source modules.\n- No security concerns are present, and the scores reflect that accurately.\n\n**Summary**:\nThe reports are thorough and accurate. The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate.",
