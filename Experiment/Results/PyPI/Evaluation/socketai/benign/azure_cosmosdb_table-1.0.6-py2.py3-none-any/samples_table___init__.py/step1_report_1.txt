{
  "purpose": "Importing modules related to table encryption, SAS, and general table samples, likely for documentation or testing purposes within a larger project.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing local modules: encryption_usage, sas_usage, table_usage",
  "sinks": "No data processing or untrusted data handling observed in this snippet",
  "flows": "Imports modules but does not process data, so no source-to-sink data flow",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected; standard import statements only",
  "analysis": "The code contains only licensing information and import statements from local modules. No data input, output, or execution logic is present. The imports are from internal modules, not external or network sources. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks. This appears to be a typical module setup or import block within a larger codebase.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import block with licensing comments, showing no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is likely part of a larger project and does not pose any security concerns.",
