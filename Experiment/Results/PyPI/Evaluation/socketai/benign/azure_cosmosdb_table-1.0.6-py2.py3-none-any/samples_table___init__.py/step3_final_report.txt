{
  "purpose": "This code snippet serves as a module import section, bringing in specific classes from local modules related to encryption, SAS, and table usage, likely for use in larger data processing or testing frameworks.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from local module files: 'encryption_usage', 'sas_usage', and 'table_usage'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; the code only imports classes without executing any data flow.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code simply imports classes without further processing or data movement.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns; the code is straightforward and license-compliant.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments and import statements from local modules, with no dynamic execution, network activity, or data handling. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0, with high confidence. The code appears to be part of a larger, well-structured package, likely for documentation or sample purposes. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The analysis is consistent across all reports, and the scores are justified based on the code's simplicity and transparency.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard import block with licensing comments, presenting no security risks or malicious intent. The current assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
