{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be importing sample classes related to table encryption, SAS, and table usage, likely for demonstration or testing purposes in a larger module.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .encryption_usage, .sas_usage, and .table_usage",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no data flows or untrusted data handling are evident",
  "flows": "No data flow paths identified; code only includes import statements",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hardcoded secrets are present; the code structure is typical of a module's import section",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement block, importing classes or functions from local modules. It contains no runtime logic, data processing, or user input handling. The licensing comment indicates open-source distribution but does not affect security assessment. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or malicious intent in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign import statement section for a larger module, with no signs of malicious activity or security issues.",
