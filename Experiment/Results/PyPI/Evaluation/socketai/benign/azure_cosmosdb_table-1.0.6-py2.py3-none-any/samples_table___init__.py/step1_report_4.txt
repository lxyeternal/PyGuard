{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python package that imports specific sample modules related to table encryption, SAS usage, and general table usage, likely for documentation or demonstration purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports modules from the same package: .encryption_usage, .sas_usage, and .table_usage",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code only performs imports without executing untrusted data or external commands",
  "flows": "Imports are straightforward and do not create source-to-sink data flows or execute untrusted data",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code contains only import statements and licensing comments. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code includes licensing comments, which are standard. It then imports three modules from the same package. No dynamic execution, no input handling, no external data access, and no suspicious behavior detected. It appears to be a typical module setup or part of a larger codebase with well-structured imports.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module import segment with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is likely part of a documentation or sample code package from Microsoft.",
