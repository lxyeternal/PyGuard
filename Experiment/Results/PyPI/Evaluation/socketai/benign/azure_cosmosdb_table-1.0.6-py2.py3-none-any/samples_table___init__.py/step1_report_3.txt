{
  "purpose": "This code imports sample classes related to table encryption, SAS, and general table usage from local modules, likely for demonstration or testing purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads from local modules: .encryption_usage, .sas_usage, and .table_usage",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data leakage or external system effects are evident",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely performs static imports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behavior are present; the code is straightforward and standard",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, likely part of a larger package. It contains licensing information and standard comments. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated parts, or risky behaviors. The structure and content are typical for a Python package setup or example module.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a simple import of demonstration or sample classes related to table encryption, SAS, and usage. There are no indications of malicious intent or security issues.",
