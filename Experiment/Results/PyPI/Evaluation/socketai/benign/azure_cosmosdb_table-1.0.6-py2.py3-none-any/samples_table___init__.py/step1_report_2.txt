{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package or module that imports specific sample classes related to table encryption, SAS (Shared Access Signature), and general table usage, likely for documentation or testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: .encryption_usage, .sas_usage, and .table_usage",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed; purely import statements",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as this is only import statements",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected; the code is straightforward and standard",
  "analysis": "The code imports three classes or functions from sibling modules, likely for usage elsewhere. No input/output handling, network operations, or sensitive data handling is present. The license headers indicate open-source licensing, and the code adheres to standard formatting. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or malicious logic are detected. The minimal code structure and straightforward imports suggest this is a standard library or sample code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and serves as part of a larger package to provide sample or test functionalities related to table encryption and SAS usage. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
