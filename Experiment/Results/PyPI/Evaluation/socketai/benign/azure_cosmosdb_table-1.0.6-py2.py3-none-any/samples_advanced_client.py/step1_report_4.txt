{
  "purpose": "The code provides examples and methods for configuring and using the Azure TableService client, including retries, endpoints, protocols, request sessions, proxies, and callbacks.",
  "sources": "Input data: placeholders for account name, account key, proxy credentials, custom headers; Data from requests and responses within callback functions.",
  "sinks": "Request headers modified in callbacks; Proxy credentials; Potentially sensitive data like account keys; Custom headers added to requests.",
  "flows": "Input placeholders used during client initialization -> configurations applied (retry policies, endpoints, protocols) -> request and response callbacks modify headers -> proxy settings and request sessions configured.",
  "anomalies": "Use of placeholders for sensitive credentials ('<account_name>', '<account_key>') without clear handling; No hardcoded secrets in code but use of dummy proxy credentials and custom headers; No malicious code patterns detected; No obfuscation or suspicious dynamic code execution; No network communication to suspicious domains.",
  "analysis": "The code demonstrates configuration of Azure TableService clients with options for retries, endpoints, protocols, request sessions, proxies, and callbacks. All modifications appear to be standard configuration practices for Azure SDK usage. The placeholders indicate intended user input rather than embedded secrets. No suspicious or malicious code, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful network activity, is present. The use of callbacks to set headers is typical for custom request handling. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are observed. Overall, the code appears benign, serving as an example or utility code for Azure Table storage operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of configuration and example snippets for Azure TableService client usage, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It uses placeholders and standard patterns, with no evidence of malware, data leakage, or malicious behavior.",
