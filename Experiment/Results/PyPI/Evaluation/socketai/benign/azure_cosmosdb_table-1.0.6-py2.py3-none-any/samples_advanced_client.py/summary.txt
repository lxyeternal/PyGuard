  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended as sample or illustrative code for configuring Azure TableService clients. There are no signs of malware or obfuscation. The main security concern is the use of placeholders and insecure configurations, which could lead to risks if replaced with real secrets in production. Overall, the code is safe in its current form, with minimal security risk, and scores are appropriate."
