  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, potential security issues, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** The code is primarily demonstrative, configuring the Azure TableService client with retries, endpoints, protocols, proxies, and callbacks. No actual secrets are embedded; placeholders are used. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors are evident.\n\n- **Security implications:** The use of placeholders indicates this is sample code. The only concern is insecure practices if real secrets are inserted, but as-is, no risk.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n  - Risk: 0.3 (moderate, due to insecure practices if secrets are replaced) — seems reasonable given it's sample code.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scoring aligns well with the analysis. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to report 1, configuration snippets with placeholders, no real secrets. No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.2 — appropriate for sample code with placeholders.\n\n**Conclusion:** Correct scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same pattern—configuration examples with placeholders, no actual secrets, no malicious code. All standard SDK usage.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.2 — consistent with benign sample code.\n\n**Conclusion:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to previous, configuration snippets, placeholders, no malicious activity. No obfuscation or malware.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.2 — fits the benign sample profile.\n\n**Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Uses hardcoded placeholders for credentials and demonstrates configuration options. No actual secrets or malicious code. The main concern is insecure practices if real secrets are used, but as placeholders, it remains a benign sample.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.3 — slightly higher, reflecting potential risk if secrets are hardcoded, but still consistent with sample code.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious or obfuscated code:** None detected in any report.\n- **Scores for malware:** All zero, appropriate.\n- **Scores for obfuscated:** All zero, appropriate.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly vary between 0.2 and 0.3, reflecting the potential for insecure practices if real secrets are embedded.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated overall scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward, sample code.\n- **Risk:** 0.2–0.3 — mainly due to insecure practices if real secrets are used, but as provided, the code is safe.\n\n**Note:** The code is primarily sample or illustrative. The potential security concern is the use of placeholders for sensitive data, which, if replaced with real secrets, could lead to security issues. However, in its current form, it poses no malware or obfuscation risks.\n\n---\n\n**Summary conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate in their assessments. The scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis. No modifications are necessary.",
