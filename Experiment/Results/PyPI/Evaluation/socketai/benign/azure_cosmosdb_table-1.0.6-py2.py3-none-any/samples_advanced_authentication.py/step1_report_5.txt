  "purpose": "Sample code demonstrating how to authenticate and connect to Azure Cosmos DB Table service using various methods.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded placeholders for account name, account key, SAS token, and connection string within the class methods.",
  "sinks": "No actual data sinks or untrusted data output; only instantiation of service clients with credentials.",
  "flows": "Credentials are read from hardcoded strings in method definitions and passed directly to service constructors.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded credential placeholders (e.g., '<account_name>', '<account_key>') which could be misused if replaced with real secrets. No sensitive data is present at runtime in this code snippet, but placeholders suggest potential risk if used as-is.",
  "analysis": "The code provides example methods for connecting to Azure Cosmos DB Table service via different authentication mechanisms: account key, SAS token, emulator, and connection string. It contains no active credential or secret data, only placeholders. The structure is straightforward and intended for instructional purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code. The use of placeholders indicates that actual secrets should be supplied externally, reducing immediate risk. However, hardcoded credentials or secrets in production code can be a security concern if replaced with real sensitive data.",
  "conclusion": "This code is primarily sample and instructional, with placeholders for sensitive credentials. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware, but improper handling of secrets in real deployment could pose security risks. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected.",
