{
  "purpose": "Demonstrates various methods of authenticating and connecting to Azure Cosmos DB Table Service",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as '<account_name>', '<account_key>', '<sas_token>', and 'connection_string' which are placeholders for sensitive credentials",
  "sinks": "Potential use of sensitive credentials to create service clients, but no data exfiltration or malicious actions are directly evident",
  "flows": "Input parameters (sources) used to instantiate service clients (sinks) via class methods, following standard Azure SDK patterns",
  "anomalies": "Use of placeholder strings for sensitive credentials; no hardcoded actual secrets. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides sample methods for connecting to Azure Cosmos DB Table Service using different authentication methods: account key, SAS token, emulator, and connection string. All credential placeholders are clearly marked and not actual secrets. No external network connections, data leaks, or malicious activities are present. The code structure follows typical SDK usage without suspicious logic. The focus appears to be on demonstrating standard usage patterns rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward sample demonstrating various Azure authentication methods. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. It appears safe and intended for educational or documentation purposes.",
