  "purpose": "Demonstrates various methods of authenticating and connecting to Azure Cosmos DB Table service",
  "sources": "Hardcoded placeholder strings for credentials: '<account_name>', '<account_key>', '<sas_token>'",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no data leak or sensitive data exfiltration observed",
  "flows": "No untrusted input flows to sensitive sinks; credential placeholders are hardcoded but not dynamically sourced",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded credential placeholders ('<account_name>', '<account_key>', '<sas_token>') which could be replaced with actual secrets, but no malicious code behavior",
  "analysis": "The code primarily demonstrates how to instantiate TableService objects using different authentication methods, including account keys, SAS tokens, emulator, and connection strings. No actual sensitive data is present, only placeholders. No dynamic input, data exfiltration, or suspicious network activity observed. The use of hardcoded placeholders could lead to security misconfigurations if replaced with actual secrets in production, but no malicious intent is evident. The code is straightforward and functions as example documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is an example of connecting to Azure Table Storage using different authentication methods. It contains no malicious behavior or suspicious code. The hardcoded placeholders should be replaced with secure retrieval methods in production, but the code itself poses no direct security threats.",
