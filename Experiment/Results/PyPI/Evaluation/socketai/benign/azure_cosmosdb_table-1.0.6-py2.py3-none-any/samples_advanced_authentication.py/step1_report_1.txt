{
  "purpose": "Sample code demonstrating how to authenticate and connect to Azure Cosmos DB Table service using various methods",
  "sources": "Hardcoded strings such as '<account_name>', '<account_key>', and '<sas_token>' used as credentials in the code",
  "sinks": "Potential use of these credentials in the creation of TableService clients; no external data outputs or network transmissions observed",
  "flows": "Hardcoded credentials are supplied directly to the CloudStorageAccount and TableService constructors, creating client objects",
  "anomalies": "Credentials are hardcoded as placeholder strings rather than being securely retrieved from environment variables or secure stores; no validation or sanitization of these inputs",
  "analysis": "The code shows standard sample patterns for authenticating to Azure Cosmos DB Table service via key, SAS token, emulator, and connection string. Credentials are hardcoded as placeholders, which could be replaced with real secrets. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network calls beyond expected SDK behavior, or backdoors is present. The code is straightforward and appears to be educational or demo-oriented. No obfuscated or suspicious logic is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard sample demonstrating Azure SDK usage with hardcoded credentials placeholders. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks but should avoid hardcoding sensitive credentials in production. The presence of placeholder strings indicates intended manual replacement, not malicious intent.",
