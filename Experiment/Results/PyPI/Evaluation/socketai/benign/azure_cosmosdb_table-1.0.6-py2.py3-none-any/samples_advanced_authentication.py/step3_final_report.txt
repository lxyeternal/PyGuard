  "purpose": "Demonstrates various methods of authenticating and connecting to Azure Cosmos DB TableService using placeholders for credentials.",
  "sources": "Placeholder strings '<account_name>', '<account_key>', '<sas_token>', and connection string variable.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data exfiltration or malicious network activity present.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of TableService objects from placeholders and connection string, with no data flow beyond SDK client creation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of placeholder strings instead of secure credential retrieval; no actual secrets embedded.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward sample illustrating SDK usage with placeholders for credentials. No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious logic is present. The main security concern is the potential misuse if real secrets replace placeholders insecurely, but as-is, the code is benign. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, educational sample demonstrating connection methods to Azure Cosmos DB with placeholders. It contains no malicious or obfuscated code. The primary security consideration is the placeholder use, which should be replaced with secure secret management in production. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk and aligns with the reports' assessments.",
