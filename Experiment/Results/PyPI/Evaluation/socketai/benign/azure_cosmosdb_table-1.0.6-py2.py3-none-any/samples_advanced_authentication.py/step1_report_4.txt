  "purpose": "Demonstration of connecting to Azure Cosmos DB Table service using various authentication methods",
  "sources": "Hardcoded strings for account_name, account_key, sas_token, and connection_string within methods",
  "sinks": "Potential exposure of credentials if code is shared or stored insecurely; passing credentials to TableService constructor",
  "flows": "Hardcoded credentials flow from code to TableService instantiation; no external input flows detected",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded placeholder credentials ('<account_name>', '<account_key>', '<sas_token>') which could be replaced with real secrets; no malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code provides sample methods for connecting to Azure Cosmos DB Table service using different authentication methods: account key, SAS token, emulator, and connection string. Credentials are hardcoded as placeholder strings, indicating these are meant to be replaced with real secrets in actual use. No dynamic or external inputs are processed, nor is there any suspicious or malicious code behavior. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious actions are present. The code does not perform any harmful operations; it is solely for demonstration purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward demonstration of Azure Table service connections with placeholder credentials. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks as written but should be used cautiously with real credentials stored securely. No malware or obfuscated code detected.",
