{
  "purpose": "This code provides sample implementations for encrypting and decrypting entities in Azure Table Storage, including key wrapping, resolution, and various encryption scenarios.",
  "sources": "Reads from imported modules (uuid, os, azure.common, cryptography, azure.cosmosdb.table), generates UUIDs, uses urandom for key generation, and creates entities and table names.",
  "sinks": "Uses cryptographic functions for wrapping/unwrapping keys, creates and deletes tables, inserts, updates, and queries entities, and uses encryption/resolver functions.",
  "flows": "Input data (UUIDs, keys, entity properties) flows into cryptographic operations and entity creation; encrypted data flows into storage operations; key resolution flows into decryption steps; encryption decisions influence insert/update/query processes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are evident; no obfuscated code or malicious network activity; the code strictly implements encryption and table storage sample operations, with no suspicious behavior or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code implements cryptographic key wrapping (AES and RSA), key resolution, and entity encryption in Azure Table Storage. It generates keys using urandom, manages keys through classes, and performs storage operations with encryption policies. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or hidden backdoors are present. The only potential concern is that the code performs sensitive cryptographic operations, but this aligns with intended encryption sample functions. No malicious anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious network activity are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate sample demonstrating Azure Table Storage encryption techniques. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. The overall security risk is minimal, mainly because it is a controlled sample focused on encryption procedures without malicious intent.",
