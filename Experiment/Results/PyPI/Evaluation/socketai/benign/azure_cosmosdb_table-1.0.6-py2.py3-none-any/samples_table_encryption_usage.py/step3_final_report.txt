{
  "purpose": "This code provides sample implementations demonstrating encryption, key wrapping (AES and RSA), key resolution, and Azure Table Storage operations for educational or testing purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from cryptographic functions, uuid generation, and Azure SDK methods for table and entity management.",
  "sinks": "Data flows from key generation and encryption functions into Azure Table storage operations, including insert, update, and query functions.",
  "flows": "Cryptographic keys and encrypted data are generated and passed through wrapping/unwrapping functions, then stored or retrieved via Azure Table SDK methods, with key resolution involved in decryption.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code constructs, hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation detected. Use of SHA1 in cryptography is outdated but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard sample demonstrating cryptographic operations with Azure Table Storage, including key wrapping, resolution, and entity management. It employs common cryptographic primitives (AES, RSA, SHA1) appropriately for sample purposes. No hardcoded secrets, malicious network activity, or sabotage are present. The use of SHA1 is deprecated but not malicious. The code structure is clear, and the cryptographic practices are typical for demonstration code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, educational sample illustrating encryption workflows in Azure Table Storage. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or backdoors. The minor cryptographic concern (SHA1) does not elevate the risk to malicious levels. Overall, the code is safe for use as a demonstration or testing resource.",
