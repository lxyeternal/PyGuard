  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, educational sample illustrating encryption workflows in Azure Table Storage. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or backdoors. The minor cryptographic concern (SHA1) does not elevate the risk to malicious levels. Overall, the code is safe for use as a demonstration or testing resource."
