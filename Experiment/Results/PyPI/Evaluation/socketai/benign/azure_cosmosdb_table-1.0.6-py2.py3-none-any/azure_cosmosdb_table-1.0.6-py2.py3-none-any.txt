      "conclusion": "Most code snippets are benign or incomplete, with minimal security risks. Dynamic execution and obfuscation features should elevate malware suspicion slightly. Adjusting the malware score for report 3 to 0.3 improves risk accuracy, aligning with potential exploitation concerns. The overall security posture remains low risk, but vigilance around dynamic code features is advised."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration template with placeholders for sensitive credentials. No malicious behavior or obfuscation is detected. The main concern is the insecure handling of secrets if replaced with real credentials, which could lead to security vulnerabilities. The current malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting moderate concern due to insecure practices but no active malicious activity."

The primary security consideration is the placeholder use, which should be replaced with secure secret management in production. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk and aligns with the reports' assessments."

The main security concern is the use of placeholders and insecure configurations, which could lead to risks if replaced with real secrets in production. Overall, the code is safe in its current form, with minimal security risk, and scores are appropriate."
