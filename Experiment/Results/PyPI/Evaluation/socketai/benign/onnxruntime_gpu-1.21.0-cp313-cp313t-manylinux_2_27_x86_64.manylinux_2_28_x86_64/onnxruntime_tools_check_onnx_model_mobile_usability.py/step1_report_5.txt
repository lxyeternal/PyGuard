  "purpose": "The script analyzes an ONNX model to assess its usability in mobile environments, providing recommendations based on the analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads the model_path argument from the command line, which is a file path to an ONNX model.",
  "sinks": "The analyze_model function from the usability_checker module, which processes the model; no direct sink of untrusted data observed in this code.",
  "flows": "User inputs the model path -> model path is passed to analyze_model -> analysis result determines logging output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors are present; the code uses standard libraries and logging practices. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes logging, parses command-line arguments for a model path and log level, and then calls an external analysis function. It includes appropriate input handling and logging. The analyze_model function is imported from a local module, and its behavior is not detailed here; however, from the context, it appears to analyze a model file without malicious intent. No insecure operations, data leakage, or malware behaviors are evident. The code structure is standard, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward command-line utility that analyzes ONNX models for mobile suitability. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this code segment.",
