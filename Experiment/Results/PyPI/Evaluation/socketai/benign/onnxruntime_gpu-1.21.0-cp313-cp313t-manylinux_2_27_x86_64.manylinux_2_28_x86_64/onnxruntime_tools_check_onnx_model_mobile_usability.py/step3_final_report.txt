  "purpose": "A command-line utility to analyze an ONNX model for mobile deployment suitability.",
  "sources": "Reads the model_path argument from command line; uses external usability_checker.analyze_model function.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows into system effects or data leaks within this code.",
  "flows": "Input model_path -> analyze_model() -> logs recommendations based on boolean result.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward argument parsing, logging, and external function call.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI tool that accepts a model file path and log level, sets up logging, and calls an external analysis function. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The external function's behavior is unknown but presumed benign. No network activity, data exfiltration, or dynamic code execution occurs. The code is well-structured and standard, with no hardcoded secrets or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for analyzing ONNX models for mobile deployment. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising behaviors are evident. The external analysis function's safety is assumed based on context. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.",
