  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their conclusions with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a legitimate parser for a configuration file related to ONNX operator support and type filtering, with no indications of malicious intent or harmful behavior.\n- **Strengths:** Highlights safe JSON handling, no code execution, and straightforward logic.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (very low, considering it's configuration parsing)\n- **Verdict:** The analysis appears accurate. No malicious activity or code injection risks are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is a legitimate configuration parser with potential risks only if the configuration file is maliciously crafted.\n- **Strengths:** Recognizes that parsing embedded JSON is handled carefully and that the code does not execute external code.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (still low, considering the nature of the code)\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No signs of malicious behavior, just standard configuration parsing.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard parser with optional type reduction features enabled via `flatbuffers`. No malicious activity is detected.\n- **Strengths:** Correctly notes that the code relies on local files and internal logic, with no network or external command execution.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2\n- **Verdict:** Well justified. No malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the safe handling of embedded JSON, no malicious behavior, and standard configuration parsing.\n- **Strengths:** Recognizes that parsing embedded JSON is done carefully, with no code execution.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2\n- **Verdict:** Consistent with the code’s behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Emphasizes that the code is a standard, safe parser with no malicious intent.\n- **Strengths:** Notes that no unsafe operations or code execution are present.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code Confirmation:** The code is purely a configuration parser for ONNX operator support and type filtering. It reads files, processes lines, handles embedded JSON snippets, and constructs data structures. There are no signs of code injection, dynamic code execution, or malicious behavior.\n- **Errors or Flaws:** No logical errors or security flaws are evident. The parsing logic is careful, especially in handling nested braces for JSON segments.\n- **Scores Justification:**\n  - **Malware:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the code.\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n  - **Risk:** Very low (0.1–0.2), justified because the code deals with configuration data only, which could be malformed but not malicious by itself.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Clear, well-structured code.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.2** — Slight potential for misconfiguration or malformed input, but no active security threat.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, safe configuration parser with no malicious intent or behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code’s functionality.",
