{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for working with ONNX models, including graph traversal, shape modifications, model optimization, and opset updates.",
  "sources": "Reads ONNX model files via onnx.load, loads model from paths, and reads environment variables (implicitly via onnxruntime).",
  "sinks": "Saves models to specified file paths, logs information, and creates temporary files for shape inference; no direct data leaks or code execution points identified.",
  "flows": "Reads model files -> performs shape inference or modifications -> optionally saves or outputs models; no untrusted data flow from external sources or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. No obfuscated code or misleading variable names present. The shape inference fallback for large models involves temporary files, but this is standard practice and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily operates on local ONNX model files, performing graph traversal, shape fixing, and model optimization. All file operations are contained and controlled, with no evidence of data exfiltration, network communication, or malicious backdoors. Usage of external libraries (onnx, onnxruntime) is legitimate and standard for model processing. The temporary file handling for large models is typical for dealing with shape inference limitations. No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-structured utility for ONNX model manipulation, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It securely handles file operations, and all processes are transparent and consistent with legitimate use cases.",
