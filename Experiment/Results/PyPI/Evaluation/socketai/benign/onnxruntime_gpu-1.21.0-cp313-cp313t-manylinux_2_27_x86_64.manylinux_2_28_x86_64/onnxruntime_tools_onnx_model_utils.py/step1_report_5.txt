{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for processing, optimizing, modifying, and analyzing ONNX models, including graph traversal, shape manipulation, and model conversion.",
  "sources": "Reads input files (model_path), loads models via onnx.load, and accesses environment info such as onnxruntime version.",
  "sinks": "Uses onnx.save, onnx.load, and onnx.shape_inference functions, which could write models or temporary files. No direct untrusted data handling is evident.",
  "flows": "Loads models from disk -> modifies graph/shape info -> saves models -> possibly updates models to new opset versions or optimized versions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code appears to be standard for model manipulation. No obfuscation or hidden code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of utility functions for ONNX model processing: graph traversal, shape adjustments, opset updates, and model optimization. It uses standard libraries (onnx, onnxruntime) and safe file operations. No external data sources, network connections, or malicious behaviors are present. The functions are designed for legitimate model handling, with no signs of malicious intent. The only minor concern might be the temporary file handling for shape inference on large models, which is a normal operational necessity and not malicious. Overall, the code performs expected tasks without suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured utility suite for ONNX model management with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It operates solely on local files and models, with standard library usage. No malicious signals or security risks are identified.",
