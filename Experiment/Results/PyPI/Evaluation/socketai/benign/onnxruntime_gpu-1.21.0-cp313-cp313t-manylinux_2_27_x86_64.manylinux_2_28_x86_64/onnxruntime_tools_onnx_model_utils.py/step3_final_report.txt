{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for processing ONNX models, including graph traversal, shape inference, opset updates, and optimization, primarily involving local file operations and model manipulations.",
  "sources": "Model files read from disk via onnx.load, model path resolution, and temporary files created for large models during shape inference.",
  "sinks": "Saving updated models to disk, optional external data files for large models, and in-memory model objects returned after processing.",
  "flows": "Model files are loaded from disk, processed through functions like shape inference or optimization, and saved back; no external network or untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Temporary file handling for large models is standard practice, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard ONNX model processing tasks using well-known libraries. It includes functions for graph traversal, shape inference, opset updates, and optimization, all of which operate locally on files or in-memory models. The handling of large models with temporary files is a common workaround. No network activity, code injection, or malicious behavior is present. The code is well-structured, transparent, and relies on standard practices, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate set of utilities for ONNX model management, with no signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the minimal security risk score reflects standard file-based operations. Overall, the code is safe and intended for legitimate model processing tasks.",
