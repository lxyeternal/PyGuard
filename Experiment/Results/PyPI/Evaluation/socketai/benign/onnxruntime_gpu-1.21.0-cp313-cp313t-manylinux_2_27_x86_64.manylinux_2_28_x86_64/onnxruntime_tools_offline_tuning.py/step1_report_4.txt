{
  "purpose": "The code provides command-line tools for extracting, embedding, merging, and pretty-printing tuning results within ONNX model files.",
  "sources": "Reads input ONNX model files, JSON tuning results files, and user command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Writes output JSON files, ONNX model files, and potentially outputs to stderr or stdout.",
  "flows": "User inputs (ONNX models, JSON files) -> Parsing and processing functions -> Output files (JSON or ONNX) or console messages.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity detected. The code processes tuning results and ONNX models without unusual or misleading behavior. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily manipulates ONNX models and JSON data for tuning results. It loads models, searches for specific metadata keys, embeds or extracts data, and performs merge operations. All data processing involves file I/O with standard libraries, with no dynamic code execution, network access, or hidden behaviors. The code appears straightforward and purpose-specific, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for managing tuning results in ONNX models. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It uses standard libraries and techniques consistent with legitimate data processing tools.",
