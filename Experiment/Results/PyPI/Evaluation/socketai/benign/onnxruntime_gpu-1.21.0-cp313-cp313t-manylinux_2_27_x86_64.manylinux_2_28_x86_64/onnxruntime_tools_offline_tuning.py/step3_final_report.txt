  "purpose": "Manage embedded tuning results in ONNX models, including extraction, embedding, merging, and pretty-printing.",
  "sources": "Reads ONNX model files, JSON tuning results files, and command-line input parameters.",
  "sinks": "Writes modified ONNX models, JSON files, and outputs to stdout/stderr.",
  "flows": "Reads model files and tuning JSON files (sources), processes data, and writes results or outputs (sinks).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs file I/O, JSON serialization/deserialization, and ONNX metadata manipulation. It uses standard libraries and practices, with no network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. The use of 'assert' is for sanity checks and not malicious. No signs of backdoors, malicious payloads, or supply chain attacks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate utility for managing ONNX model tuning results. It shows no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The overall security risk is negligible.",
