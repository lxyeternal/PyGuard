{
  "purpose": "This script manages embedded tuning results in ONNX models, allowing extraction, embedding, merging, and pretty-printing of tuning data.",
  "sources": "Reads ONNX model files, JSON tuning results files, and user input from command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Outputs JSON files, modified ONNX models, and printed or logged messages to stdout/stderr.",
  "flows": "Loads ONNX models or JSON data from files; processes tuning results; embeds or extracts data; saves or outputs results.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Usage of standard libraries and functions appears benign. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code handles reading and writing ONNX models and JSON files related to tuning results. It employs safe practices like deep copying and assertions to manage embedded data. No external network connections, credential handling, or sensitive data processing detected. Command-line argument parsing is straightforward, and all data is handled through standard input/output or file I/O. No signs of malicious or suspicious behavior are present. The structure and usage are typical for a utility script intended for model tuning management.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard utility for managing tuning results within ONNX models, with no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It operates solely on files and data passed through command-line arguments. Therefore, it poses no security threat or malware risk.",
