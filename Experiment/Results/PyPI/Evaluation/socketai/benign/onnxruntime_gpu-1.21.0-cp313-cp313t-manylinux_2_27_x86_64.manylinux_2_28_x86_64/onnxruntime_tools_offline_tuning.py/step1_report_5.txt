{
  "purpose": "This script manages embedding, extracting, merging, and pretty-printing tuning results within ONNX model files, primarily for optimizing models via tuning results stored in metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads ONNX model files, JSON files containing tuning results, and command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Writes output to files (ONNX models and JSON files), potentially overwriting files based on flags.",
  "flows": "Input files are read (model and tuning results JSON), processed (extraction, merging, embedding), and results are written back to files. Command-line arguments determine flow paths.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code observed. Use of 'assert' for control flow may be notable but not malicious. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data exfiltration present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file operations (reading and writing JSON and ONNX models), parsing command-line inputs, and manipulating data structures for tuning results management. No signs of malicious intent such as network communication, hidden backdoors, or data theft. The code relies on well-known libraries and follows normal patterns for file handling and data processing. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic was identified. The use of 'assert' could be considered an undesirable practice but is not inherently malicious. Overall, the code appears to serve a legitimate purpose related to model tuning management without malicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for managing ONNX model tuning results. It does not contain malware, malicious behaviors, or supply chain threats. The code is straightforward, with no suspicious signals detected.",
