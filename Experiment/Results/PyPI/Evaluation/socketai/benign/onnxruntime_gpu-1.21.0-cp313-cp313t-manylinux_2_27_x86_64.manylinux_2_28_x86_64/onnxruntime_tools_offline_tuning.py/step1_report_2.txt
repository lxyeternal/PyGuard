{
  "purpose": "The code provides tools for extracting, embedding, merging, and pretty-printing tuning results within ONNX model files or separate JSON files, primarily for model optimization workflows.",
  "sources": "Input files: ONNX models and JSON files containing tuning results; also reads environment variables indirectly via system libraries.",
  "sinks": "Output files: JSON files for tuning results, modified ONNX models; uses file write operations but no untrusted network or system command execution observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input files (JSON or ONNX) into in-memory data structures, potentially merged or extracted, then written out as JSON or embedded into ONNX models. No untrusted data directly flows into system or network functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or covert data exfiltration mechanisms detected. Use of deep copies and ordered dicts appears standard. No obfuscation or malicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages serialization and deserialization of tuning results, with functions for embedding and extracting metadata within ONNX models. The merge functionality combines multiple tuning results into a consolidated structure. The code relies on standard libraries and the 'onnx' package for model manipulation. No malicious code, external network calls, or suspicious behaviors are present. It is designed for legitimate model tuning workflows. There are no indicators of malware, hidden backdoors, or supply chain attacks. Overall, the code performs straightforward data handling and command-line operations without security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign utility script intended for managing tuning results within ONNX models. It does not contain malware, suspicious behaviors, or security vulnerabilities. Its purpose aligns with legitimate model optimization workflows. Confidence in this assessment is high.",
