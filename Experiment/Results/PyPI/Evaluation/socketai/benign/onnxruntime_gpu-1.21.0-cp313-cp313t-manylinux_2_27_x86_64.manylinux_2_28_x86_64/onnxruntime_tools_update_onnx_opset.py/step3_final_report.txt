  "purpose": "A command-line utility to update the ONNX model's opset version, with optional specification of the target opset.",
  "sources": "Input model path, output model path, optional opset argument from command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "The external function 'update_onnx_opset' which processes the model files.",
  "flows": "Arguments parsed from command line → 'update_onnx_opset' called with input path, target opset, and output path.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward utility that parses command-line arguments for input/output model files and an optional opset version, then calls an external function to perform the update. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The code is clear, uses standard libraries, and performs a benign file operation. The external dependency 'update_onnx_opset' is not examined but is presumed safe based on context. No obfuscation or security flaws are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, low security risk ~0.1) are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for updating ONNX model opset versions. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The external utility function's safety is assumed but not verified here. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk and is safe for use.",
