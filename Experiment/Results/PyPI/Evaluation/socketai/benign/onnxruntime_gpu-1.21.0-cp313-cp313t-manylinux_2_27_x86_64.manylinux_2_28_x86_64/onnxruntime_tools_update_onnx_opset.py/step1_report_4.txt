{
  "purpose": "This script updates the ONNX model's opset version to a specified value, defaulting to 15 if not provided.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from command-line arguments: 'input_model' and 'output_model', which are file paths provided by the user.",
  "sinks": "The code passes the input and output model paths to 'update_onnx_opset' function, which likely processes or modifies the ONNX model file.",
  "flows": "User provides 'input_model' path -> 'update_onnx_opset' processes the model -> updated model saved to 'output_model' path.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected. Usage of standard libraries and straightforward argument parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and a local utility. It defines a function to parse command-line arguments for updating an ONNX model's opset. The script appears to facilitate model version updating without performing any network operations, data leaks, or system modifications. No suspicious or malicious activity detected, and no obfuscated code present. The logic is simple and aligned with common model processing workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for updating ONNX models' opset versions. No malicious or suspicious behavior identified. It appears to be a standard, safe utility script.",
