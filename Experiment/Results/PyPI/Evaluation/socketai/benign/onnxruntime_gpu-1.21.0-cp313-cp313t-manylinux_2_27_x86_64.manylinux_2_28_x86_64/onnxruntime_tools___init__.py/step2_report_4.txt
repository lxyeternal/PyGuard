  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Behavior and Presence of Issues:**\n   - All reports agree that the code performs a simple, standard check for the presence of the 'torch' library using `importlib.util.find_spec(\"torch\")`.\n   - If 'torch' is available, it conditionally imports a helper module (`pytorch_export_helpers`) or a function (`infer_input_info`).\n   - There are no indications of data leaks, untrusted data handling, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The code snippet is minimal, straightforward, and typical for optional dependencies.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in Logic or Reasoning:**\n   - No errors or flaws are evident. The logic is correct and standard.\n   - The reports correctly identify that this pattern is benign and used for optional support.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware: 0`\n     - `securityRisk: 0`\n     - `obfuscated: 0`\n     - `confidence: 1`\n   - These scores are consistent with the analysis. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The risk scores are all 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Since the code performs a benign environment check and conditional import, there is no security threat.\n   - No justification for higher scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports.\n   - This is correct because there is no malicious activity, code injection, or suspicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions and correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - No unwarranted claims are present.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's behavior and the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, benign pattern for optional dependency handling.\n- No security risks, malware, obfuscation, or anomalies are present.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- I agree with the current scores: all are 0 for malware and security risk, with high confidence.\n- No further action or re-scoring is necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code snippet is safe and does not pose any security threat.",
