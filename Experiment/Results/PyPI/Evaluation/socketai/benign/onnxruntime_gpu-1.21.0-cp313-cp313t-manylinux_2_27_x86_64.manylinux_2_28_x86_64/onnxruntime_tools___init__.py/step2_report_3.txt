  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Functionality & Behavior**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code performs a standard check for the presence of the 'torch' library using `importlib.util.find_spec('torch')`.\n   - If 'torch' is available, it conditionally imports a local helper module (`pytorch_export_helpers`) or a specific function (`infer_input_info`).\n   - The code is a common pattern for optional dependencies, enabling extended functionality when a package is installed.\n\n2. **Security & Malicious Behavior**:\n   - No report indicates any malicious activity, suspicious behavior, or backdoors.\n   - The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or include obfuscated code.\n   - There are no hardcoded secrets, data leaks, or other security risks.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes**:\n   - The logic is straightforward and standard; no errors or flaws are evident.\n   - The code is minimal, with clear intent, and follows best practices for optional dependency handling.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware score: 0\n     - Obfuscated score: 0\n     - Security risk: 0\n     - Confidence: 1\n   - These scores are consistent with the analysis; no changes are necessary.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - Since the code only performs a benign environment check and conditional import, the risk is minimal.\n   - The code's purpose is to extend functionality if optional dependencies are present, which is standard practice.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment**:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score**: 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**My own estimate** aligns with the reports: the code is benign, standard, and poses no security threat.\n\n**Conclusion**: The current scores are appropriate. No modifications are needed.",
