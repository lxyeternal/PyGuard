{
  "purpose": "This code is used to conditionally import a helper module for PyTorch if the 'torch' library is available, likely for facilitating PyTorch-related functionality in the onnxruntime package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the presence of the 'torch' package via importlib.util.find_spec(\"torch\")",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that handle untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or malicious actions",
  "flows": "Source: importlib.util.find_spec(\"torch\") -> Conditional import of .pytorch_export_helpers infer_input_info",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. The code conditionally imports a helper module based on package presence, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The script checks whether the 'torch' library is installed using importlib.util.find_spec. If it is present, it imports a helper function from a local module. This is a common pattern for optional dependencies and does not introduce any security concerns. The code is minimal, straightforward, and lacks any dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard dependency check and conditional import for optional PyTorch support within a package. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected based on this snippet.",
