{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to conditionally import a helper function from a local module if the 'torch' library is available, likely to assist with PyTorch-related operations within the onnxruntime package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the presence of the 'torch' package using importlib.util.find_spec('torch').",
  "sinks": "The code does not have any apparent sinks that process untrusted data or perform insecure operations.",
  "flows": "The source (checking for 'torch') leads to a conditional import of a local helper module, with no data flow to external systems or insecure operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a conditional import based on the presence of a third-party library. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code starts by importing importlib.util to check if the 'torch' package is available. If 'torch' is installed, it imports a helper function 'infer_input_info' from a local module. This pattern is typical for optional dependencies and does not involve any user input, network operations, or insecure behavior. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or code injection. The code's structure is straightforward and standard for conditional imports based on available packages.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, conditional import pattern used to extend functionality when optional dependencies are present. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
