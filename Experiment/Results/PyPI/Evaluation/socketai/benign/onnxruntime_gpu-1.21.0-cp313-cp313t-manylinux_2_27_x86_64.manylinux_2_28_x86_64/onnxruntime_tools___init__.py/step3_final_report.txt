  "purpose": "To check for the presence of the 'torch' library and conditionally import a helper module if available, enabling optional dependency support.",
  "sources": "importlib.util.find_spec('torch') to detect if 'torch' is installed.",
  "sinks": "Conditional import of '.pytorch_export_helpers.infer_input_info' when 'torch' is present.",
  "flows": "Detection of 'torch' via find_spec → conditional import of helper module.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward dependency check and import pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard optional dependency check for 'torch' using importlib.util.find_spec. If 'torch' is installed, it imports a helper module for further functionality. The pattern is common and safe, with no data leaks, untrusted input handling, or malicious behavior. No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious code are present. The logic is simple, clear, and aligns with best practices for optional dependencies. No signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The scores (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature. Confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard pattern for optional dependency management with no security threats or malicious intent. The current scores are accurate and do not require adjustment.",
