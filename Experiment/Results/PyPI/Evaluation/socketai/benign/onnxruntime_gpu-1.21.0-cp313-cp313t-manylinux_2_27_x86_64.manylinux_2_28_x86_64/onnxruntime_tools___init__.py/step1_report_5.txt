  "purpose": "Conditionally import a helper module if the 'torch' library is available.",
  "sources": "importlib.util.find_spec('torch') to check for the presence of 'torch'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leakage.",
  "flows": "Source: have_torch variable set by find_spec. If true, imports a local helper module.",
  "anomalies": "Simple conditional import; no anomalies or suspicious code patterns. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code checks for the presence of the 'torch' library using importlib.util.find_spec. If 'torch' is available, it imports a helper module from the current package. The logic is straightforward and safe. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The import is conditional on library availability, which is common in optional dependency handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a conditional import based on optional dependency presence. No malicious intent or security risks identified.",
