  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   The code snippet is a straightforward conditional import pattern based on the presence of the 'torch' library. It uses `importlib.util.find_spec` to detect if 'torch' is installed, and if so, imports a helper module. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities in this pattern. All reports agree on this point.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n   The reports correctly identify that this is a benign, standard pattern for optional dependencies. They do not overlook any potential issues. No logical errors or misconceptions are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   All reports assign:\n   - Malware: 0\n   - SecurityRisk: 0\n   - Obfuscated: 0  \n   These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n   Since the code does not perform any malicious actions, does not handle untrusted data, and is just a dependency check, these scores seem reasonable. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   The highest risk score here is 0, indicating no security concern. This aligns with the code's behavior. No justification for raising the risk score is needed.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct. The code does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious constructs.\n\n6. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify this as a benign pattern.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis. They correctly reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThis code snippet is a standard, safe, and benign pattern for optional dependency management. It poses no security threat or malicious activity.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \nGiven the detailed analysis, I agree with the provided scores. They accurately reflect the code's nature.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- No issues present.  \n- No anomalies or malicious intent detected.  \n- Scores are appropriate and should remain at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nAccept the report as accurate; no further action needed.",
