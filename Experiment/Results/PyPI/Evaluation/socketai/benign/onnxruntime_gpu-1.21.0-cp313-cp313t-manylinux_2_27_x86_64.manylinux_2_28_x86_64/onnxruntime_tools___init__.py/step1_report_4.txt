{
  "purpose": "To conditionally import a helper module for PyTorch if it is available, facilitating additional functionalities related to PyTorch in the onnxruntime module.",
  "sources": "The code checks for the presence of the 'torch' package using importlib.util.find_spec().",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves detecting if 'torch' is available and then importing a specific helper module if it is.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are evident; the code performs a straightforward conditional import without obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with standard licensing comments. It then imports importlib.util to check if the 'torch' package is installed. If 'torch' is found, it imports a local module 'pytorch_export_helpers' to potentially extend functionality. This is a common pattern for optional dependencies and does not involve any suspicious or malicious behavior. There are no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code execution, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code appears benign and intended for modular extension.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign pattern for optional dependency management, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It simply enhances functionality when PyTorch is available.",
