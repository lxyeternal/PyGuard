{
  "purpose": "The code dynamically checks for the presence of the 'torch' library and conditionally imports a helper module related to PyTorch export functionalities.",
  "sources": "importlib.util.find_spec('torch') to check for the 'torch' library",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code only performs a conditional import based on library availability",
  "flows": "Presence of 'torch' triggers the import of a helper module, but no data flows from external inputs to sensitive operations",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behaviors such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious actions are observed",
  "analysis": "The code begins with a license comment and a note about being appended to __init__.py. It imports 'importlib.util' to perform a library presence check. The check for 'torch' is done via find_spec, and if available, it imports a helper module for PyTorch export. This is a standard dynamic import pattern to conditionally include functionality based on environment. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks, and the code's structure and behavior are straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign, standard environment check and conditional import without any suspicious or malicious activity. It poses no security threat.",
