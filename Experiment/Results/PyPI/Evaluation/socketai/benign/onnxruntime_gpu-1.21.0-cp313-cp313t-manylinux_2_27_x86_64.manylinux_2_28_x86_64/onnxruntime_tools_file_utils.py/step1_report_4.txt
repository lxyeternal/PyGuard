  "purpose": "Utility functions for matching file paths by suffix and retrieving files from a given path, with optional filtering.",
  "sources": "Path inputs from function parameters (`path`, `file_or_dir_path`) and the predicate function applied during file traversal.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no untrusted data flows to sensitive operations or external systems.",
  "flows": "Input path or directory -> traversal or single file processing -> predicate filtering -> output list of files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no malicious or backdoor logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides basic file system operations: path matching and recursive directory traversal with filtering. It handles path input types flexibly, ensuring proper conversion to Path objects. The functions do not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications. The predicate allows custom filtering but does not introduce malicious behavior. No unusual or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward utility module for file handling with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities.",
