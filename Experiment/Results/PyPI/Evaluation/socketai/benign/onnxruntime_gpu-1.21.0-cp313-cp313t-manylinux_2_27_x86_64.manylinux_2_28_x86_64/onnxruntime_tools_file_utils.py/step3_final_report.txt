  "purpose": "Utility functions for matching file suffixes ignoring case and retrieving files from a specified path with optional filtering.",
  "sources": "Filesystem reads from provided path, directory traversal via os.walk, predicate filtering functions.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks or external data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input path converted to pathlib.Path, directory traversal collects files, predicate filters files, results returned as list.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, standard filesystem utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard libraries to perform benign filesystem operations. No network activity, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no malicious logic are present. The functions accept user input paths and predicates, which could be misused if combined with malicious data elsewhere, but within this code, no vulnerabilities are evident. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard utility module for file handling with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and the low security risk scores (0 or 0.1) are justified given the context.",
