{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions to match file suffixes ignoring case and to retrieve files from a directory or a single file based on a predicate.",
  "sources": "Reads input from 'path' parameters which can be user-supplied paths or paths derived from user input, and from the filesystem via os.walk.",
  "sinks": "Uses the filesystem to access files and directories. No untrusted data is directly sent to other systems or outputs.",
  "flows": "Input paths are converted to pathlib.Path objects, then files are read from the filesystem. The predicate function is applied to files for filtering.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code performs standard file handling and path operations. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: one for suffix matching ignoring case, another for retrieving files from a specified path, filtering by a predicate. The functions handle input validation, convert inputs to pathlib.Path, and traverse directories with os.walk. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious data exfiltration, or suspicious operations. The functions use common Python idioms and standard libraries, with no external calls to suspicious domains or network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions for file handling, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It operates within normal filesystem access patterns without any suspicious or malicious code. The overall security risk is very low.",
