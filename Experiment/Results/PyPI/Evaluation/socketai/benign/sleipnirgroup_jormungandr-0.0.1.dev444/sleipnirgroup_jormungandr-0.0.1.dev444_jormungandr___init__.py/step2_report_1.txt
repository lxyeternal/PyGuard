  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No. The code is a minimal module with only a docstring and an import statement. No evidence of malicious activity, data leaks, or anomalies.\n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  None. The report correctly notes the lack of suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate, no malware detected.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — code is clear, no obfuscation.  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0.2 — possibly a slight concern due to reliance on a local module, but not significant.\n- **Justification for Scores:**  \n  The low malware and obfuscated scores are justified. The security risk is minimal given the limited code.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No. The use of wildcard import and obscure module name '_jormungandr' could be considered suspicious, but there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  The report notes that wildcard imports can obscure dependencies, which is a valid concern, but not necessarily malicious.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — justified, no malware observed.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0.4 — moderate, due to module name and import style.  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0.2 — acceptable.\n- **Justification for Scores:**  \n  The obfuscation score is reasonable, given the module name and import style, but no malware is evident.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No. The code is minimal, with standard import practices.\n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  None. The report correctly dismisses any malicious concern.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — clear code.  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0.1 — negligible.\n- **Justification:**  \n  The low scores are justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No. The snippet is straightforward, with no suspicious activity.\n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  None. The report accurately assesses the code.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — justified.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — code is clear.  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0.1 — minimal.\n- **Justification:**  \n  Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No. Again, minimal code with only an import statement.\n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  None. The report correctly notes the lack of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — justified.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — clear code.  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0.1 — acceptable.\n- **Justification:**  \n  Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  All reports indicate no malware, and given the code's simplicity, I concur with a malware score of **0**. There's no evidence of malicious payloads or behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  The only concern is the module name '_jormungandr' and the use of wildcard import, which could be considered obfuscation. However, the code is minimal and not inherently malicious. I would assign an obfuscated score of **0.2** to reflect some level of obscurity but not malicious intent.\n\n- **Risk Score:**  \n  The overall security risk is low. The reports' scores are consistent, and the minimal code does not suggest security vulnerabilities. I would set the risk score at **0.1**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- The code appears safe based on the provided snippets.\n- The main concern is the module name and import style, which warrants cautious review of the actual '_jormungandr' module.\n- No changes needed to the scores based on current evidence.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Value | Justification                                                  |\n|-----------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0            | No malicious activity observed.                                |\n| Obfuscated      | 0.2          | Slight obfuscation due to module name and import style.       |\n| Security Risk   | 0.1          | Minimal risk given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior. |\n\nThis comprehensive review supports that the code is benign but warrants standard caution due to module naming and import practices.",
