  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Presence of issues:** The code is minimal—only an import statement and a docstring—so no issues are directly observable.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No logical errors or flaws; the report correctly notes the reliance on an internal module without evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are both zero, which aligns with the assessment. Security risk is low (0.2), justified by the minimal code.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious behavior; reliance on an internal module is standard for complex libraries.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, with a note that full security depends on the contents of `_jormungandr`.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Presence of issues:** Similar minimal code; the use of wildcard import and obfuscated module name `_jormungandr` are noted.\n- **Errors/flaws:** The report correctly identifies that wildcard imports can be risky and that obfuscated module names could be suspicious but not necessarily malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware score remains zero; obfuscated score is 0.4, which seems reasonable given the obfuscation hints.\n- **Justification:** No evidence of malware; the obfuscation is a concern but not conclusive.\n- **Conclusion:** Overall safe but warrants caution.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Presence of issues:** Same minimal code; no issues observed.\n- **Errors/flaws:** The report appropriately notes the standard nature of the import and lack of suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware remains zero; obfuscated at 0, which is consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** No security issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Presence of issues:** Again, only an import statement and a descriptive docstring.\n- **Errors/flaws:** Correctly notes the lack of malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** Malware zero; obfuscated zero.\n- **Conclusion:** No concerns.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Presence of issues:** Same minimal code; no issues.\n- **Errors/flaws:** Properly states that the code is straightforward and safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware zero; obfuscated zero.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Synthesis and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree there's no evidence of malicious activity. Given the code snippet is just an import statement, this is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Slight variation—some reports assign a 0.4 due to the module name `_jormungandr` being obscure. This is reasonable, but since the code is minimal, I would consider the obfuscation as moderate but not high.\n- **Risk score:** All are low (around 0.1–0.2), which makes sense given the limited code.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (consistent across reports and justified)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.3 (moderate, considering the module name and import style)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low, due to minimal code and no suspicious activity)\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The reliance on `_jormungandr` warrants further review of that module's contents to ensure no malicious code exists internally.\n- Wildcard imports can be risky if the imported module is compromised or malicious, but in a controlled, internal package, this is less concerning.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code appears benign based on the provided snippet.\n- The scores are reasonable; I would slightly adjust obfuscated to 0.3 for a balanced view.\n- No evidence supports increasing the malware or risk scores.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.3\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nProceed with caution by reviewing the `_jormungandr` module itself for comprehensive security assurance.",
