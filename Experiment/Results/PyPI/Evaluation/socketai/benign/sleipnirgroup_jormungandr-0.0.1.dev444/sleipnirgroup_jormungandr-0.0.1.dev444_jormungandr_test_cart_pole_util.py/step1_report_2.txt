{
  "purpose": "Implementing dynamics simulation for an acrobot/cart-pole system, both in standard numpy and autodiff versions.",
  "sources": "Reads include the input variables x (state) and u (control input). Uses mathematical functions from math and autodiff modules.",
  "sinks": "Uses numpy.linalg.solve to compute q̈; no data sinks or network communication present.",
  "flows": "Input variables x and u are processed through physics calculations to produce q̈ (accelerations). Autodiff version uses autodiff.solve for derivatives.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No network operations, no obfuscated code, no unusual constructs. Use of autodiff for derivatives is standard for such applications.",
  "analysis": "The code models a physical system (cart-pole) using standard physics equations. Two functions implement dynamics: one with plain numpy and math, another with autodiff variables for gradient calculations. No malicious behavior or malicious code patterns identified. No suspicious data handling, code injection, or external communications are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of cart-pole dynamics simulation for control or optimization purposes. It uses standard libraries and techniques without malicious intent. No security risks or malware indicators detected.",
