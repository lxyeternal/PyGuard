  "purpose": "Modeling cart-pole dynamics for simulation and control, with both numeric and autodiff implementations.",
  "sources": "Input state vector x, control input u, and internal variables like theta and qdot.",
  "sinks": "Solution of linear systems (np.linalg.solve or autodiff.solve) to compute accelerations; no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input variables (x, u) → computation of matrices (M, C, tau_g) → linear solve for q̈ → output qddot.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard physics equations for a cart-pole system, both numerically and with autodiff. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues are present. Use of autodiff is typical for gradient-based optimization, not malicious intent. Scores of malware=0 and obfuscated=0 are justified. Risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting benign use. No network or secret handling is involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent physics simulation with autodiff support, free of malware or obfuscation. Security risk is minimal, and the scores should reflect that.",
