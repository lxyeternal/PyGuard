{
  "purpose": "Defines differential drive robot dynamics functions using numpy and autodiff libraries for simulation or control purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads input state vector 'x' and control input 'u'; computes velocities and derivatives internally.",
  "sinks": "No external data or network interactions; calculations are self-contained within functions.",
  "flows": "Source inputs 'x' and 'u' flow into the functions; outputs are derivatives 'xdot' used for simulation or optimization.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external data leaks detected.",
  "analysis": "The code models standard robot differential drive dynamics with clear, well-structured functions. It employs common mathematical formulas and libraries without any suspicious behavior. Use of autodiff is typical for gradient-based methods. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of robot dynamics modeling. It shows no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a low risk score (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
