  "purpose": "Define and compute differential drive robot dynamics, both in raw numerical form and using autodiff for derivatives.",
  "sources": "Input data includes state variables 'x' and control inputs 'u'. The functions read these variables to compute derivatives.",
  "sinks": "Computed derivatives 'xdot' are returned; no untrusted data is written or transmitted outside the functions.",
  "flows": "Input 'x' and 'u' flow into the functions, are processed through mathematical operations, and produce 'xdot' as output.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for dynamics modeling. Uses numpy and a custom autodiff module, with no hardcoded secrets or unusual code constructs. No suspicious I/O or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code models differential drive robot dynamics using both direct numerical calculations and autodiff. It computes linear and angular velocities, then derives position and orientation derivatives. Uses numpy for matrix operations and a custom autodiff module for symbolic differentiation. No input validation, data leaks, or network activity is present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are observed. The code appears to be a typical dynamics model implementation, with proper use of mathematical functions and matrices. No anomalies or suspicious patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of robot dynamics modeling without malicious intent. It is consistent with standard practice in robotics simulations or control algorithms. No signs of malware or security risks were found.",
