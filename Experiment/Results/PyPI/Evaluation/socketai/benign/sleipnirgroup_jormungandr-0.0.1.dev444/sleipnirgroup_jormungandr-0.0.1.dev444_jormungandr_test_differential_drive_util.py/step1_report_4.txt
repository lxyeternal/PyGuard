  "purpose": "This code defines the dynamics of a differential drive robot, including parameters, matrix calculations, and functions to compute state derivatives based on current state and control inputs.",
  "sources": "Reads data from input parameters (x, u), and internal variables such as A, B matrices and robot parameters.",
  "sinks": "Computes derivatives and internal calculations; no untrusted data outputs or network communications are present.",
  "flows": "Input states (x, u) are used to calculate derivatives via mathematical operations and matrix multiplications; no external data flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behavior detected. Use of mathematical libraries and custom functions appears consistent with robot dynamics modeling.",
  "analysis": "The code models robot dynamics using standard equations and matrix operations. It uses both numpy for numeric computation and a custom autodiff library for differentiable variables. No obfuscated code, no suspicious network calls, and no hardcoded secrets are present. The functions perform straightforward physics calculations relevant to robot motion. The code structure and variable names are clear and consistent with expected modeling practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation of differential drive dynamics for a robot, with no evidence of malicious intent or supply chain attack behavior. It employs common mathematical procedures for robot modeling and uses open-source libraries appropriately.",
