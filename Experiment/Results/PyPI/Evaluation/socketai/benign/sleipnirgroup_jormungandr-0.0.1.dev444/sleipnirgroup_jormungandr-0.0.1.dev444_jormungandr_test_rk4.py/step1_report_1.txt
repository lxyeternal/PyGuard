{
  "purpose": "Performs 4th order Runge-Kutta integration for solving differential equations numerically.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'f', 'x', 'u', and 'dt'. The function 'f' is called multiple times with 'x' and 'u'.",
  "sinks": "Returns the new value of 'x' after integration. No external data sinks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into the calculations of k1, k2, k3, k4, which are combined to produce the output. No external or untrusted data flows outside this scope.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or obfuscation observed. The code implements a standard RK4 method without suspicious modifications.",
  "analysis": "The function 'rk4' performs a mathematical numerical method for differential equations. It uses a standard pattern of calculating k1 to k4 and combines them for the result. No external data sources or sinks are used. The implementation appears correct and straightforward. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. It relies solely on the provided function 'f' and parameters, which are typical for such a numerical routine.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of the RK4 numerical integration method with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign mathematical utility function.",
