  "purpose": "Perform 4th order Runge-Kutta numerical integration for differential equations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: function f, initial value x, control input u, and timestep dt.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data directly causes data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Input data (x, u, dt) are used in calculations; the function f is called with x and u; results propagate through k1, k2, k3, k4 to produce output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated constructs. The code performs standard numerical integration with no hidden actions.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard RK4 integration step, calling the function f with current x and u, then combining the results to produce the next x. All operations are typical for numerical methods. No external data fetching, no system calls, no data leakage, or suspicious behavior is detected. The function f is user-supplied, which is common in such numerical routines, and there are no signs of malicious intent or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of the Runge-Kutta 4th order method for differential equations. It appears benign, with no malicious or suspicious activity detected. The code is typical for scientific computing and does not exhibit obfuscation or malware characteristics.",
