  "purpose": "Performs 4th order Runge-Kutta numerical integration for differential equations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters f (function), x (initial state), u (constant input), dt (time step).",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that process untrusted data for harmful effects.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used directly in mathematical computations; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs observed. The code appears straightforward and mathematically standard.",
  "analysis": "The function defines a numerical integrator using RK4 method, with clear parameter usage and standard calculations. No external system calls, network operations, or suspicious constructs. The code is well-documented and uses typical mathematical operations for integration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of the RK4 algorithm with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs numerical integration safely and predictably.",
