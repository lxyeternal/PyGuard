{
  "purpose": "This function performs a 4th order Runge-Kutta numerical integration for differential equations of the form dx/dt = f(x, u).",
  "sources": "The function reads input parameters: the function 'f', initial state 'x', control input 'u', and timestep 'dt'.",
  "sinks": "The function returns an updated value of 'x' after integration. No other data sinks or external data writes are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are fed into 'f' to compute intermediate k-values, which are then combined to produce the output 'x'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual operations are present. The code performs standard numerical integration without external data or side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of the RK4 algorithm for solving ODEs. It accepts a function 'f' and parameters, computes intermediate slopes (k1 to k4), and returns the updated state. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious external interactions. The code is clean, well-structured, and follows standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of RK4 integration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not access external data, write files, or perform network operations. No suspicious behavior detected.",
