  "purpose": "Perform 4th order Runge-Kutta numerical integration of dx/dt = f(x, u) over a timestep dt.",
  "sources": "Function f(x, u) called multiple times with current x and control u.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network activity, or side effects; data flows within function calls.",
  "flows": "Inputs x and u are used to compute intermediate slopes k1 to k4, which are combined to produce the new x.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious constructs; straightforward implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard RK4 routine, correctly implementing the numerical method. It relies on an external function f, which could be malicious if untrusted, but the code itself performs no malicious actions. No obfuscation or external data access is present. The function calls are safe, and the implementation is clear and correct. The main external concern is the trustworthiness of f, not the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of RK4 integration. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1), reflecting potential risk if the external function f is malicious. Overall, the code does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation, and the risk depends on external factors.",
