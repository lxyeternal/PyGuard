  "purpose": "Setup and solve a physics-based optimal control problem for a robotic elevator and arm system, involving decision variables, constraints, and a quadratic cost function.",
  "sources": "Decision variables for elevator and arm states and accelerations, input parameters for system limits, and external libraries for autodiff and optimization.",
  "sinks": "The call to 'problem.solve()' which executes the optimization process.",
  "flows": "Input parameters and decision variables flow into constraints and cost function definitions, culminating in the solver invocation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or external data interactions; the code is straightforward and physics-based.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a standard optimal control problem with explicit physics constraints, bounds, and a quadratic cost. It uses common libraries and no external data or network activity. The commented height constraint is benign. The solver call is typical. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. The code's structure and logic are clear and consistent with typical engineering optimization tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of an optimal control problem for a robotic system. No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
