  "purpose": "The code defines an optimization problem and a test case for Mishra's Bird function using the jormungandr optimization library.",
  "sources": "Input data: DecisionVariables inputs; Data read from function parameters; External library functions (autodiff, pytest).",
  "sinks": "Output: problem.solve() result, variable values; No evidence of untrusted data being written or used insecurely.",
  "flows": "Input DecisionVariables -> mishras_bird_function_solve -> problem setup -> optimization -> output results.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up an optimization problem using a well-known test function, utilizing external libraries for differentiation and optimization. It reads input values, defines an objective function, applies a constraint, and solves the problem, then verifies results in a test. There are no signs of malicious code, suspicious data handling, or security risks. The libraries used are standard and do not suggest malicious intent. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of an optimization test case.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of an optimization problem with a test case. No malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks are detected. It appears safe and correctly structured.",
