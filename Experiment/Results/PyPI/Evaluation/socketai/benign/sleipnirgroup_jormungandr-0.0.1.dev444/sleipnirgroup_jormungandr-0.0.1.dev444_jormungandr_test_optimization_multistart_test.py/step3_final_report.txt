  "purpose": "Set up and solve an optimization problem using Mishra's Bird function with constraints, testing the optimization routine.",
  "sources": "Decision variables x and y set via class instances; mathematical functions from autodiff library.",
  "sinks": "Output of problem.solve(), returning solution status, objective value, and decision variables.",
  "flows": "Decision variables initialized -> Objective function computed -> Constraint applied -> Problem solved -> Results returned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation with standard libraries; no obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines decision variables, constructs an optimization problem with a known test function, applies a constraint, and solves it. It uses standard mathematical functions and testing frameworks. No external data, network activity, or secrets are involved. The code is clear, readable, and intended solely for testing optimization routines. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of an optimization test case with no malicious intent or security risks. It is safe, well-structured, and appropriate for its purpose.",
