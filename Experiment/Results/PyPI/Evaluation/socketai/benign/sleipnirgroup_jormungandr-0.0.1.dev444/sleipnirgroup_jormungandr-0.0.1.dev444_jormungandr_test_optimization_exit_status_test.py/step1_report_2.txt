{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of test cases for a mathematical optimization problem class, testing various exit statuses and problem configurations.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from method calls such as problem.decision_variable(), problem.subject_to(), and method parameters like max_iterations and timeout.",
  "sinks": "Potential untrusted data flows include the results of problem.solve() which may influence program control flow based on exit statuses.",
  "flows": "Data flows from problem.decision_variable() and problem.subject_to() as inputs; results of problem.solve() determine control flow based on exit status.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are detected. The code appears straightforward, with typical test structures.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs optimization problems with various constraints and objectives, then checks for specific exit statuses after solving. No external data or network operations are present. No suspicious behaviors or malicious code patterns are identified. The code strictly interacts with a known API, invoking problem-solving routines and assertions based on expected outcomes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate test cases for an optimization library. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware is evident. It does not perform any unsafe operations or data leaks. The code's structure and content are consistent with standard testing practices.",
