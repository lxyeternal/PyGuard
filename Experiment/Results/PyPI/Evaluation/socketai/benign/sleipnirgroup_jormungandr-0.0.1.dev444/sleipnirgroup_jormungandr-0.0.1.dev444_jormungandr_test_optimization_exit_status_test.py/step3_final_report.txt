{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for an optimization solver, verifying various exit statuses under different problem configurations.",
  "sources": "Decision variables, callback functions, parameters like max_iterations and timeout, and input arguments to 'solve()'.",
  "sinks": "The return value of 'problem.solve()', which indicates the exit status.",
  "flows": "Input parameters and problem setup influence the control flow within 'solve()', leading to specific exit statuses checked by assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external data leaks detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, employing standard testing patterns for an optimization library. It creates problem instances, applies constraints, and verifies expected exit statuses. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are present. The callback functions are simple lambdas controlling flow, and no external data or network activity occurs. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test suite for an optimization framework, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scoring accurately reflects its safety and simplicity.",
