  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's actual content, the reasoning provided, and the scoring assigned.\n\n**1. Code Verification:**\n- The code is a straightforward, auto-generated version module with static version strings and tuples.\n- No external data sources, network activity, dynamic code, or obfuscation.\n- The code is minimal, with standard practices such as TYPE_CHECKING and __all__.\n\n**2. Logical and Reasoning Analysis:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is static, benign, and generated by setuptools-scm.\n- They emphasize the absence of malicious patterns, external data handling, or obfuscation.\n- The reasoning aligns with the code's simplicity and purpose.\n\n**3. Score Evaluation:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n- These scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n- The confidence level is 1, which is justified.\n\n**4. Potential Issues or Assumptions:**\n- The reports assume that static version definitions are inherently safe, which is reasonable.\n- No false positives or unjustified risk scores are evident.\n- The code does not contain any suspicious constructs or behaviors.\n\n**5. Consistency and Justification:**\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- The reasoning correctly concludes that the code is benign.\n\n**6. Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, auto-generated version info module.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Estimated scores based on the review:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, as a precaution, but practically negligible)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a typical, benign version definition file with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the code poses no security threat. The scoring aligns with the code's characteristics.",
