{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools-scm, and provides version strings and tuples for package management.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version strings (__version__ and version), type checking import statements (TYPE_CHECKING), and variable assignments.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sources or data leak points are present.",
  "flows": "Assignment of hardcoded version strings to variables (__version__, version) and tuples (__version_tuple__, version_tuple). No external data flow or user input involved.",
  "anomalies": "Use of TYPE_CHECKING with conditional import, but no unusual or suspicious behavior observed. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or complex logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard version info module, auto-generated by setuptools-scm. It defines version-related variables with hardcoded values. No external inputs, no data leaks, and no malicious or suspicious behaviors are present. The presence of type checking imports is typical for modern type hints. The code is minimal, clear, and standard for version management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and solely manages package version information. No malicious behavior, no security risks identified.",
