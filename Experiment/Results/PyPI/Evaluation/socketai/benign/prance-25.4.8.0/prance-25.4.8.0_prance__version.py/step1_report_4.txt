{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information variables for a Python package, generated by setuptools-scm, to facilitate version tracking and compatibility.",
  "sources": "The code reads static version strings and tuples assigned directly in the script.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or input; all data is statically assigned.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: static version data is assigned to variables, with no dynamic input or external data sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors. The __all__ declaration and TYPE_CHECKING block are standard practices and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script is a minimal, static version metadata module generated by setuptools-scm. It defines variables for version info, uses standard type checking constructs, and assigns static values. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious operations. The code appears intentionally simple, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign version information module with no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It serves a straightforward purpose of defining version metadata for a package.",
