  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**1. Review of the code and reports:**\n\n- The code is a standard auto-generated version file created by setuptools-scm.\n- It assigns static version strings and tuples to module variables.\n- Uses conditional import for type checking, which is common practice.\n- No external data input, network activity, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code's purpose is purely to define version metadata.\n\n**2. Confirm if issues are present:**\n\n- There are no issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors in the code.\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n\n**3. Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; no logical errors or misconceptions are evident.\n- They correctly interpret the code as a straightforward version declaration.\n\n**4. Score assessments:**\n\n- All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`.\n- These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- The `confidence` score is 1 across all, which is justified.\n\n**5. Justification for any higher risk scores:**\n\n- Since the code is static, auto-generated, and contains no malicious behavior, raising risk scores above 0.5 would be unjustified.\n- The malware score is correctly set to 0, as there's no malware present.\n- The obfuscated score is correctly 0; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- The overall security risk is correctly 0.\n\n**6. Challenge any assumptions:**\n\n- The reports assume the code is benign, which aligns with the analysis.\n- No assumptions about potential vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is based on the code's actual content.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores:**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a standard, auto-generated version info module with no malicious or suspicious elements. The assigned scores accurately reflect this.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nAll reports are accurate and appropriately scored. No modifications or concerns are necessary. The code poses no security risk, malware, or obfuscation issues.",
