  "purpose": "Define version information for the package, generated by setuptools-scm",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuples; import statements within TYPE_CHECKING block",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data handling or untrusted input sources present",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; simple variable assignments",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; standard version definition",
  "analysis": "The code only defines version-related variables with static values; uses conditional import for type checking, which is standard practice. No external data input, no network activity, no data leakage, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard version definition code with no malicious intent or security risks.",
