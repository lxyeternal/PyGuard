  "purpose": "Define and set version information for a Python package generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version strings and tuples.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Assignment of version strings and tuples to module variables.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of static variable definitions, including version information. It uses conditional typing imports, which are standard in type hinting practices. The version variables are hardcoded, but this is typical for version definitions and not malicious. There are no external data reads, no network activity, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic. The file explicitly states it is generated by setuptools-scm and should not be modified, indicating it's a standard, auto-generated versioning module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version declaration file generated by a build tool, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
