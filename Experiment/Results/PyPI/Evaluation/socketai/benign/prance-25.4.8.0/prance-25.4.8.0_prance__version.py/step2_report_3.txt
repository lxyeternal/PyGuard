  "review": "Let's systematically analyze the reports and the code:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - The code is a standard, auto-generated version module created by setuptools-scm.\n   - It defines version variables (`__version__`, `version`, `__version_tuple__`, `version_tuple`) with static, hardcoded values.\n   - It includes a `TYPE_CHECKING` block for type hints, which is a common practice.\n   - No external data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present.\n   - The code contains no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious constructs.\n\n2. **Assessment of Security Risks & Malicious Behavior**:\n   - The code's purpose is purely to define version information.\n   - No evidence of malicious intent, such as embedded malware, backdoors, or obfuscated malicious logic.\n   - The consistent pattern across reports indicates a benign, standard pattern for versioning modules.\n\n3. **Analysis of Report Scores**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - The confidence score is 1 in all cases, which is justified.\n\n4. **Potential Flaws or Misinterpretations**:\n   - No flaws or logical errors are evident.\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as benign, static, and auto-generated.\n   - No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities that aren't supported by the code.\n\n5. **Overall Justification**:\n   - The code is a straightforward, static version declaration.\n   - The scores assigned are consistent with the code's characteristics.\n   - There is no need to adjust the scores; they accurately reflect the analysis.\n\n**Final Expert Summary**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is benign, standard, and poses no security threat.\n\n**My Overall Estimate**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
