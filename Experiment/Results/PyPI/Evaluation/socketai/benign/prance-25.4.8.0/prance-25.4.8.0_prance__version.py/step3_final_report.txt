{
  "purpose": "Defines version information for the package using static, auto-generated variables.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version strings and tuples assigned to module variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; static data only.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from sources to sinks; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, auto-generated, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static version declaration module generated by setuptools-scm. It assigns fixed version strings and tuples, with conditional type checking imports. There are no external data sources, network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. All indicators point to benign, standard practice for version metadata. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified given the code's nature. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are present. The code's purpose is purely informational, with no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated version info module with no security concerns. The reports accurately assess its benign nature, and the scoring reflects this. No modifications are necessary.",
