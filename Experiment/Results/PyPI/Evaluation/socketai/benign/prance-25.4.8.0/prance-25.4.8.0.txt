      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for caching and serializing specifications, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only concern is the use of a class attribute for caching, which could cause cache sharing issues in multi-instance contexts, but this does not constitute a security risk. The dynamic imports are standard and safe. The malware score should remain at 0, obfuscated at 0, and the risk score can be maintained at approximately 0.1 due to the minor cache attribute issue. Overall, the supply chain security risk is negligible."

It employs external libraries properly, handles untrusted input cautiously, and shows no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The assigned malware and obfuscation scores are 0, and the risk score (~0.1-0.2) is justified given the context."

The malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting typical supply chain considerations."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for handling data and environment checks. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The low security risk score (around 0.2) is justified given the use of dynamic imports for optional dependencies, which are standard practice. The malware score is 0, and obfuscation is absent. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety."
