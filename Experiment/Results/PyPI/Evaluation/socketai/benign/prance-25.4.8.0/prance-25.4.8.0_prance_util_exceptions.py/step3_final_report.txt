  "purpose": "A utility function to re-raise exceptions with preserved traceback and optional additional message.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'from_value' (exception object), 'extra_message' (string), and 'klass' (exception class).",
  "sinks": "The function raises an exception; no external data sinks or network activity involved.",
  "flows": "Input 'from_value' and 'extra_message' flow into the construction of the exception instance, which is then raised.",
  "anomalies": "The 'finally' block sets 'klass' to None, which is unnecessary but harmless; no other anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard pattern for re-raising exceptions with additional context, preserving traceback via 'from'. It handles 'from_value' being None or an exception, appends messages if provided, and raises the constructed exception. The 'finally' block does not impact security or functionality. No external data handling, cryptography, or network activity is present. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. The logic is correct, and the exception handling pattern is standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard exception handling helper with no malicious or security issues. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.",
