  "purpose": "Helper function to raise exceptions while preserving traceback and message, facilitating exception chaining.",
  "sources": "Input data is the 'from_value' exception object and optional 'extra_message' parameter.",
  "sinks": "Raising exceptions with customized messages; no external data sinks or network operations.",
  "flows": "Input exception 'from_value' and optional message flow into the creation and raising of a new exception instance.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed. The code performs standard exception handling logic.",
  "analysis": "The function 'raise_from' attempts to re-raise exceptions with additional context, preserving the traceback via 'from'. It handles 'None' for 'from_value', appends extra messages if provided, and raises the specified exception class. The 'try' block ensures proper exception chaining, and the 'finally' block clears the 'klass' reference, which is harmless but somewhat unnecessary. No network calls, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard helper for exception chaining, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as intended for error handling purposes.",
