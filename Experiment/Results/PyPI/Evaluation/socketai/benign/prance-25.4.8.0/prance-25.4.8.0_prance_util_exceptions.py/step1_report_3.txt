  "purpose": "Helper function for raising exceptions while preserving traceback and message details.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "The 'raise' statements could propagate exceptions, but there are no external data sinks or network effects.",
  "flows": "No external sources or sinks; the function manipulates exception objects internally.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The function 'raise_from' is designed to re-raise exceptions with added context while preserving the traceback. It accepts an exception class, an optional exception instance to re-raise from, and an optional message. The code conditionally constructs the exception to be raised, appending extra messages if provided. It uses standard exception handling and the 'raise ... from' syntax. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or unintended data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a utility for exception handling without any malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard exception wrapping and re-raising, with no suspicious activity or security vulnerabilities detected.",
