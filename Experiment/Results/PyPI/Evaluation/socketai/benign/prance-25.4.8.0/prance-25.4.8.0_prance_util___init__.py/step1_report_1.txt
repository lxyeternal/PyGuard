  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling data structures and validation backend detection in the Prance project.",
  "sources": "Code reads from the collections.abc.Mapping module, dynamic imports of 'flex', 'openapi_spec_validator', and 'swagger_spec_validator'.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic import statements may be susceptible if import sources are maliciously altered, but in typical use, they import standard libraries or installed packages. No direct data leaks or untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No significant source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted input. The only data manipulation is in 'stringify_keys', which processes provided data structures locally.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic imports within try-except blocks is standard but can be exploited if malicious modules are introduced in the environment. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors are present. No obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions: 'stringify_keys' converts all keys in a mapping to strings recursively; 'validation_backends' attempts to import specific validation modules, appending their names to a list if successful; 'default_validation_backend' returns the first available backend or raises an error if none are available. All operations rely on standard Python features, environment modules, and safe practices. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The dynamic import pattern is typical for optional dependencies and not inherently malicious in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard utility code with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It handles data structure processing and optional dependency detection securely. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.",
