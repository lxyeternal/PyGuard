  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, standard use of dynamic imports for optional dependencies, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The low security risk score seems reasonable given the use of dynamic imports, which are common for optional dependencies. The malware score of 0 aligns with no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, no external untrusted data sources, no suspicious code, standard pattern.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** The zero security risk and malware scores are appropriate. The confidence is high (1), reflecting strong certainty.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above—no signs of malicious activity, straightforward utility functions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, safe optional dependency detection, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Scores are justified.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as others—safe, standard utility code, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, which is consistent with the code's behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code's nature—utility functions with optional dependency detection—the risk is minimal. The only minor concern is the use of dynamic imports, which could theoretically be exploited if the environment is compromised, but this is a common pattern and not inherently risky.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports is accurate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 is correct.\n- **Risk Score:** The reported scores (mostly 0 or 0.2) are reasonable. A slightly higher but still low score (e.g., 0.1) could be justified if we consider the potential (though unlikely) exploitation of dynamic imports in a compromised environment. However, as it stands, 0.2 is acceptable for the first report, and 0 for others.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to account for the dynamic import pattern, but acknowledging it's standard and low risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard utility module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The current scores are appropriate, and I agree with the assessments provided.",
