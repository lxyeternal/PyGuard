  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** No malicious code, standard dynamic imports for optional dependencies, no obfuscation, no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.  \n- **Assessment:** The low security risk score (0.2) seems appropriate given the use of dynamic imports, which are common for optional dependencies but can pose minor risks if environment integrity is compromised. The malware score of 0 aligns with no malicious activity detected.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, no external untrusted data sources, straightforward logic, no obfuscation or malicious code.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** The zero risk and malware scores are justified. The code is purely utility and environment detection.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as above, standard utility functions, no suspicious patterns, safe import handling.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Reiterates the previous points—safe, standard utility code, no malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as others, no signs of malicious activity, safe optional dependency checks, no obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct.  \n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious code, network activity, or suspicious behavior detected.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate given the code's clarity and straightforwardness.  \n- **Risk Score:** The only minor point is the use of dynamic imports, which could be exploited if the environment is compromised. However, in a controlled environment, this is standard practice for optional dependencies. The scores of 0.2 or 0 are reasonable.  \n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\nThe code is standard utility code for handling data structures and optional dependencies. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The risk scores are slightly conservative but justified considering the dynamic import pattern, which could be exploited in a compromised environment.\n\n---\n\n### My Final Estimated Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (I would lean towards 0.1, acknowledging the minor potential for dependency-related issues but considering this a common pattern and not inherently risky)\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent and accurate. No changes are necessary.",
