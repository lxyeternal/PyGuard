  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** Standard utility functions; no malicious behavior; dynamic imports are typical for optional dependencies.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.  \n- **Assessment:** The low risk score (0.2) seems appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The malware score is 0, which aligns with no malicious activity. The confidence is high (0.9). No issues here.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1; straightforward utility functions; no external data sources or malicious behaviors.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Perfectly consistent. No concerns.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as above; safe data handling and optional dependency detection.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Same pattern; safe, standard utility functions with no malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as others; no malicious behavior detected.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, which is consistent with the code.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; all reports agree on this.  \n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero in Report 1 (0.2), which is reasonable given the use of dynamic imports, but overall, the code is very safe.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is standard utility code, performing data normalization and optional dependency detection.  \n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious logic.  \n- Dynamic imports are a common pattern for optional dependencies and do not pose security risks in this context.  \n- The low risk score in Report 1 (0.2) is justified, but overall, the risk across all reports should remain very low.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, due to dynamic imports, but standard practice and safe in context)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The scores in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.",
