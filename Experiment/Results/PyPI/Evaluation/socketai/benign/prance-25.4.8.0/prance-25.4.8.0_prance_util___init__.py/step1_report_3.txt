  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling data and validation backends in the Prance module.",
  "sources": "Data input comes from function parameters, particularly 'data' in stringify_keys.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious actions; import statements are safe and controlled.",
  "flows": "Data flows through stringify_keys for key stringification; environment imports for validation backends determine available options.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code simply performs data manipulation and conditional imports.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions with standard behaviors: recursive key stringification, environment-based detection of available validation backends, and selection of default backend. The import statements are enclosed in try-except blocks that handle ImportError or SyntaxError, which is common for optional dependencies. There are no signs of malicious code such as network communication, code injection, or data exfiltration. No suspicious control flow or obfuscated code present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate utility functions for handling data and environment detection. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
