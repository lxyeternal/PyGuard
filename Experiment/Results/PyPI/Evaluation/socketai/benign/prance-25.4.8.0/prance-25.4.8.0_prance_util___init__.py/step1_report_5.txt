  "purpose": "Utility functions for data processing and environment validation in the Prance project.",
  "sources": "User-provided data (via function parameters), module imports.",
  "sinks": "Potentially affected by imported modules and function outputs, but no direct data sinks for untrusted input are evident.",
  "flows": "Data is transformed through recursive stringification, and environment validation functions check for module availability.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures detected. The import statements are standard for optional dependencies. No obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions: 'stringify_keys' recursively converts dictionary keys to strings; 'validation_backends' checks for the presence of optional validation modules; 'default_validation_backend' selects a default based on available modules or raises an error. The import handling uses try-except blocks to safely check for optional dependencies without executing any dangerous code. There are no suspicious patterns, malicious behaviors, or security risks identified in the provided code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be straightforward utility functions with safe handling of imports and data transformation. No malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The code is well-structured and secure in its current form.",
