  "purpose": "Utility functions for processing data structures and determining validation backends in the Prance project.",
  "sources": "No external untrusted data sources are explicitly read; the functions operate on passed parameters and import modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external system interaction are present.",
  "flows": "Data is processed internally within functions, with no external flow from untrusted sources to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are observed. The code performs straightforward operations such as type conversion and optional module imports.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions with no network activity, no file system manipulation, and no dynamic execution of untrusted code. It conditionally imports validation libraries and selects a default backend based on availability, which is a typical pattern and does not introduce malicious behavior. No obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious logic are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility code for a Python project, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It solely performs data manipulation and environment checks without external interactions or sensitive operations.",
