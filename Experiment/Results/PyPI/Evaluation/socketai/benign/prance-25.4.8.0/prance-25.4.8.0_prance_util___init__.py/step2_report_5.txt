  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their conclusions with the code, and evaluate the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states the code is standard utility code with no malicious behavior, highlighting the dynamic imports as typical for optional dependencies. The malware score is 0, security risk is 0.2, and confidence is 0.9.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code uses dynamic imports within try-except blocks, which is common for optional dependencies. The report correctly notes that no malicious behavior is detected, and no data leaks or suspicious code are present.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0 is appropriate; securityRisk = 0.2 seems slightly high given the benign nature, but considering the potential for environment manipulation (e.g., malicious modules installed), a small risk score can be justified. Confidence at 0.9 aligns with the thorough analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's reasoning is sound. The scores seem reasonable, although the securityRisk could be slightly lower, but not unreasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing no external untrusted data sources, no network activity, and no suspicious patterns. Malware score is 0, securityRisk is 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent with the code. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, which are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Well justified. The report is consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the data input, the safe nature of import statements, and the absence of suspicious code patterns. Malware score is 0, securityRisk is 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code's behavior is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity. The use of try-except for optional dependencies is standard.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0 are justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing safe data handling, standard import patterns, and no malicious intent. Malware score is 0, securityRisk is 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Well justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the safe, straightforward nature of the code, with no malicious behaviors. Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code.\n\n- **Scores:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious actions, nor does it contain obfuscated or suspicious code.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate; the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Most reports assign 0 or 0.2. Given the benign nature, a risk score of 0.2 might be slightly conservative but acceptable considering the potential for environment manipulation via malicious modules.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n\n- No modifications are necessary; the reasoning and scoring appear sound.\n\n- The overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at:\n\n  - **Malware:** 0\n\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n  - **Risk:** 0.2 (or possibly 0, but 0.2 is acceptable as a conservative measure)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is standard utility code with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The reports' assessments and scores are justified and accurate.",
