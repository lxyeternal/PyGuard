  "purpose": "Utility functions for data handling and validation backend detection in the Prance project.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input parameters (e.g., in stringify_keys), and dynamically imports optional validation libraries (flex, openapi_spec_validator, swagger_spec_validator).",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that process untrusted data directly in a way that leads to data leaks or execution; the imports are conditional and do not execute code from external sources.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., dictionaries) flows through stringify_keys, with potential recursive processing; dynamic imports influence the return of available validation backends, but do not execute untrusted code from external sources beyond standard import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The use of dynamic imports is standard for optional dependencies, with no malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for handling dictionary keys and determining available validation backends. The stringify_keys function recursively converts dictionary keys to strings, which is a safe data transformation. The validation_backends function conditionally imports optional validation libraries without executing code from untrusted sources; it only checks for their presence. The default_validation_backend function raises an error if no validation backend is available. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. All code logic appears standard and safe, focusing on environment checks and data processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility module with no evidence of malicious intent or malware. It performs data normalization and optional dependency detection securely. No security risks or malware indicators are present.",
