  "purpose": "Utility functions for data normalization and environment validation, including optional dependency detection.",
  "sources": "Import statements for optional dependencies ('flex', 'openapi_spec_validator', 'swagger_spec_validator') within try-except blocks.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; dynamic imports are used for optional dependencies, not for untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Code attempts to import optional modules; if successful, appends module names to a list; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import within try-except blocks is standard for optional dependencies; no suspicious or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for data structure manipulation and environment capability detection. It uses standard Python practices such as recursive key stringification and conditional imports for optional dependencies. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscated code are present. The dynamic import pattern is common and not inherently risky, though it could be exploited if the environment is compromised. Overall, the code is straightforward, well-structured, and free of malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for handling data and environment checks. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The low security risk score (around 0.2) is justified given the use of dynamic imports for optional dependencies, which are standard practice. The malware score is 0, and obfuscation is absent. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety.",
