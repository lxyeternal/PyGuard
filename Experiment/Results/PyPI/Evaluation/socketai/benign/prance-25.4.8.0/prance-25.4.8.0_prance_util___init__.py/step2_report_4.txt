  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Summary:** No malicious behavior detected; standard utility functions for data processing and environment checks.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.  \n- **Assessment:** The low security risk score (0.2) seems appropriate given the use of dynamic imports and data manipulation, which are standard practices. The malware score is correctly zero, as no malicious activity is evident. The confidence is high (0.9). No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, no suspicious activity; straightforward utility code.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** The zero security risk and malware scores are justified. The code is safe and standard. No adjustments necessary.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Summary:** Consistent with previous reports; no malicious or suspicious code.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** The scores align with the code's behavior. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Summary:** Same conclusion; safe utility functions with optional dependencies.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Summary:** No suspicious activity; standard data handling and environment detection.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code only performs data manipulation and optional dependency detection, which are safe operations.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation is present; all code is straightforward.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Given the absence of vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or suspicious patterns, a low security risk score (around 0.0 to 0.2) is appropriate. The reports' scores of 0.2 or 0 are reasonable.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports — consistent and justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 — minimal, due to dynamic imports, but these are standard and safe in context.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 — acknowledging the dynamic import pattern as a potential minor concern but not inherently risky.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate given the code's behavior. No significant security issues are present.",
