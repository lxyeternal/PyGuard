  "purpose": "The code implements parsers for Swagger/OpenAPI 2.0 and 3.0.0 specifications, handling loading, validation, and reference resolution.",
  "sources": "URL fetches via fetch_url, spec strings via parse_spec, and internal reference resolution.",
  "sinks": "Validation functions (validate_spec, validate), reference resolution, and specification parsing.",
  "flows": "Input sources (URL/spec string) → parsing functions → validation → reference resolution → final specification object.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Placeholder URL is standard for testing.",
  "analysis": "The code uses well-known validation libraries and standard input handling. No external network activity beyond validation, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious data leaks. The validation steps are straightforward, and error handling is appropriate. The placeholder URL is typical for testing environments. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are present. The security and malware scores are consistent with the code's behavior, which is a standard, well-structured parser with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of an OpenAPI/Swagger parser with validation and reference resolution. It employs external libraries properly, handles untrusted input cautiously, and shows no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The assigned malware and obfuscation scores are 0, and the risk score (~0.1-0.2) is justified given the context.",
