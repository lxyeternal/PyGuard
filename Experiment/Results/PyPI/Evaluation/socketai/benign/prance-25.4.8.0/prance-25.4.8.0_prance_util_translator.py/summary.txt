  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-implemented JSON reference resolver with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The main security consideration is the reliance on external URL fetches, which is inherent to its function but should be used cautiously in untrusted environments. The malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting typical supply chain considerations."
