  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for caching and serializing specifications, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only concern is the use of a class attribute for caching, which could cause cache sharing issues in multi-instance contexts, but this does not constitute a security risk. The dynamic imports are standard and safe. The malware score should remain at 0, obfuscated at 0, and the risk score can be maintained at approximately 0.1 due to the minor cache attribute issue. Overall, the supply chain security risk is negligible."
