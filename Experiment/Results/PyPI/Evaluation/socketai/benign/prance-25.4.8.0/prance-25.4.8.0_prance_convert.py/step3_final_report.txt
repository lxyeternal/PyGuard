  "purpose": "Provides functions to convert Swagger/OpenAPI 2.0 specifications to 3.0.0 using an external API, fetch URLs, and serialize specs.",
  "sources": "Spec strings, URL fetch functions, external API endpoint for conversion",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to external API, URL fetching, serialization",
  "flows": "Input spec or URL -> parsing/serialization -> API request -> response handling",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility for converting API specs via an external service. It fetches data from URLs, parses and serializes specs, and sends them over HTTP. No malicious patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded credentials are present. External API reliance is standard and does not indicate malicious intent. The code handles untrusted input but does not perform validation, which is typical for such tools. No signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, low-risk utility for API spec conversion. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The minimal security risk stems from reliance on an external API and handling untrusted input, which is justified and not malicious.",
