  "purpose": "CLI for validating, compiling, and converting OpenAPI/Swagger specifications.",
  "sources": "User input via command-line arguments, file paths, URLs, and environment variables.",
  "sinks": "File writing operations, printing output to console, exit calls, and network calls for conversion.",
  "flows": "Input sources (URLs, file paths) are processed, parsed, and validated; outputs are written to files or printed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of deprecated option flags noted but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script orchestrates command-line operations for spec validation, compilation, and conversion using external libraries and internal functions. It performs input validation, file handling, and network requests for conversion, with proper error handling and validation. There are no signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden network activity. Usage of sys.exit on validation errors is standard for CLI tools. The code does not execute dynamic code, obfuscate logic, or include malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate CLI utility for managing API specifications with no malicious intent or security risks detected. No suspicious or malicious behavior observed.",
