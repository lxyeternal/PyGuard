  "purpose": "CLI tool for validating, compiling, and converting OpenAPI/Swagger specifications using prance.",
  "sources": "Input URLs or file paths, external API call in convert_url, filesystem read/write operations.",
  "sinks": "File output, network request to external conversion API, process termination via sys.exit.",
  "flows": "Input data -> parsing/validation -> optional conversion via external API -> output to file or stdout.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated options, dynamic imports within functions, reliance on external conversion API, lack of input sanitization.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard CLI application built with click, performing spec validation, compilation, and conversion. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. External API calls are expected for conversion and do not indicate malicious intent. Dynamic imports and deprecated options are minor concerns but not malicious. The network activity during conversion is typical for such tools. The malware score is justified as 0, obfuscation as 0, and the security risk is low (~0.1-0.2) due to external dependencies and minor code practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured CLI utility with no signs of malicious behavior or backdoors. External API reliance is standard but should be used cautiously. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.",
