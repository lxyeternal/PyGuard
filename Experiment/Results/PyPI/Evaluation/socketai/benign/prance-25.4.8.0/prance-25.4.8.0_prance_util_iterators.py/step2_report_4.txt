  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The reviewer finds no suspicious or malicious code, noting standard recursion and iteration patterns. They assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk of 0, which seems reasonable given the benign nature described.\n- **Potential issues:** No issues detected. The code is a utility for nested data traversal.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, the review confirms no malicious intent, with standard patterns. Malware score is 0, and security risk is 0.\n- **Potential issues:** No concerns. The functions are safe and straightforward.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, no signs of malicious behavior, with clear documentation and standard iteration logic. Malware score remains 0, security risk 0.\n- **Potential issues:** None apparent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports; the functions are safe, with no external effects or obfuscation. Malware score is 0, security risk 0.\n- **Potential issues:** None.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion; the code is a benign nested data traversal utility. Malware score is 0, security risk 0.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Justification:\n\n- **Code confirmation:** The code matches the description and the logic in all reports.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate. The code performs safe recursion and filtering without any malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, indicating no security risk. This is justified because the code only reads and yields data; it does not perform external actions, execute code, or handle secrets.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is clear and understandable)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Overall:** The reports are consistent and justified. The code is a safe utility for nested data traversal, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If I were to assign scores independently, I would agree with the existing assessments. No modifications are necessary.",
