  "purpose": "Configuration script for Sphinx documentation generation, defining project settings, themes, extensions, and output options.",
  "sources": "Imports from prance module for version information, list of extensions, static path, and configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks are present. No network, file, or system modification code identified.",
  "flows": "No identifiable data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; configuration settings are static and derived from known modules.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code constructs. The script contains standard configuration parameters and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx documentation configuration file with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or external data handling. The only import from 'prance' is used for version info, which is benign. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are evident. All parameters are typical for documentation setup and do not exhibit signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a legitimate configuration file for Sphinx documentation with no malicious or security-risk behavior. It contains no malware, backdoors, or data leakage mechanisms. The code appears safe and standard for its purpose.",
