  "purpose": "Configuration script for Sphinx documentation generation for the 'prance' project.",
  "sources": "Imports from prance (__version__ as release), external modules (re), and static/static path definitions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks of untrusted data, no network, file, or system command executions present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows indicative of malicious activity. The code mainly sets configuration variables.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscated sections, or unusual patterns. The code appears standard for a documentation setup.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Sphinx configuration file. It imports the package's __version__, sets up various options for documentation generation, theme customization, and output formats. No dynamic code execution, no input handling, no network connections, and no credential handling are present. All imported modules are standard or part of the documentation process. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code injection.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign configuration script for Sphinx documentation. It contains no malicious intent or security risks. The code's purpose is purely to configure documentation generation with no evidence of malware or malicious activity.",
