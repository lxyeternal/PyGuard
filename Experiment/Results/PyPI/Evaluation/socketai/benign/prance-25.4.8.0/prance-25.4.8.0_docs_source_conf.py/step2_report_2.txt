  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard Sphinx configuration file.\n- The only dynamic element is importing the version from `prance` and parsing it with regex.\n- No network activity, file modifications, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code.\n- The code is static, well-structured, and typical for documentation setup.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n\n1. **Malware Score (all reports):**  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the analysis—no malicious code or behavior is present.\n\n2. **Obfuscated Score (all reports):**  \n   All assign 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward, transparent code.\n\n3. **Risk Score (all reports):**  \n   The risk score is set at 0.1 in the first report and 0 in others. Given the comprehensive analysis, the minimal risk score (0) is more appropriate because:\n   - The script does not perform any risky operations.\n   - The only import from `prance` is benign.\n   - Regex parsing is harmless.\n\n**Potential Discrepancies:**\n- The first report assigns a risk of 0.1, citing no direct malicious activity but a slight caution. However, since no actual vulnerabilities or suspicious behaviors are present, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n- The code is a legitimate, benign configuration file.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores should reflect the absence of risk and malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (consistent across all reports)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (consistent)\n- **Risk:** 0 (more accurate than 0.1, given the analysis)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nBased on the detailed review, **the code is safe, standard, and free of malicious intent.** The current scores are appropriate, but the risk score should be lowered from 0.1 to 0 to better reflect the benign nature of the script.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis provided.",
