  "purpose": "This code is a configuration script for setting up Sphinx documentation for the 'prance' project, defining extensions, paths, and project metadata.",
  "sources": "Import of 'prance.__version__' for version parsing, static configuration parameters, and optional commented-out code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, network calls, or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Import of version info from 'prance' leads to version parsing; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, static, and typical for documentation setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static configuration file with no dynamic or malicious code. It imports a version string from an external package, which is benign, and uses regex for parsing, which is safe. No network activity, data leaks, or obfuscation are present. The code structure is standard and transparent, with no suspicious patterns or secrets. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a very low risk score (0) are consistent with the benign nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe Sphinx configuration script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate and reflect its benign nature.",
