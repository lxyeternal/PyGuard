  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Each Report:**\n\n- All five reports agree that the code is a standard Sphinx configuration script for the 'prance' project.\n- They identify no dynamic or malicious code, no network activity, no data leaks, and no suspicious patterns.\n- The only import from 'prance' is used to retrieve version info, which is benign.\n- No obfuscation, secrets, or backdoors are present.\n- The code is static, straightforward, and typical for documentation setup.\n\n**Detailed Evaluation:**\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present.\n   - The code is a conventional configuration file with no dynamic execution beyond benign imports.\n   \n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n   \n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 or very close to 0.\n   - These are appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n   \n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports suggest any reason to assign high risk scores.\n   - The code is purely configuration with no malicious activity.\n   \n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n   - No malicious behavior is detected or inferred.\n   \n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are grounded in static analysis; no unwarranted assumptions are evident.\n   \n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Report:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   \n**Overall Systematic Judgment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final Expert Estimate:**\n\nGiven the thorough review, I concur with the assessments provided. The code is a standard, benign Sphinx configuration script with no security concerns.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis supply chain component (the configuration script) is safe. No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The reports are accurate and consistent with my analysis.",
