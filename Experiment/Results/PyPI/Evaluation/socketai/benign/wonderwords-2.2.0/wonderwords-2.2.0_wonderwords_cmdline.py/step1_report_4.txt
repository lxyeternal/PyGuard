{
  "purpose": "This code defines a command-line interface (CLI) for the Wonderwords application, providing methods to display titles, commands, and words with styled console output.",
  "sources": "The code reads __version__ from the local module, and uses input data such as 'word' and 'words' parameters passed to functions.",
  "sinks": "Output to console via rich library methods; no direct sinks for untrusted data beyond display.",
  "flows": "Input data ('word', 'words', 'sent') flows from method parameters to console output, with minimal processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed. The use of rich library for formatting is standard; no dynamic code execution or obfuscated constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply formats and outputs text to the console, utilizing the rich library for styling and layout. The only input sources are method parameters and the imported __version__ from the local module, which appears to be a version string. No external data input, network calls, or file I/O is present. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The functions are straightforward print helpers with no complex logic or unsafe practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a CLI display utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not process untrusted external input in a dangerous way, nor does it contain obfuscated or malicious code. Overall, it appears safe and standard.",
