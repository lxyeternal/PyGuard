{
  "purpose": "A CLI display module for the Wonderwords package, responsible for styled console output including titles, commands, version info, words, sentences, and error messages.",
  "sources": "Reads version from __version__, static method parameters (words, sentences), and internal constants.",
  "sinks": "Outputs styled text and markdown to the console via rich library functions.",
  "flows": "No external data or untrusted input flows; only internal data and method parameters are used for display.",
  "anomalies": "Minor syntax typo in the 'version()' method's console.print() call where string concatenation is malformed; no malicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI display utility leveraging the rich library for styled output. It reads version info from a module attribute and displays static and dynamic text. No input validation, data fetching, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The only anomaly is a minor syntax typo that does not pose security risks. The code's simplicity and lack of external data handling indicate no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The only issue is a minor syntax typo that should be corrected for code correctness but does not impact security.",
