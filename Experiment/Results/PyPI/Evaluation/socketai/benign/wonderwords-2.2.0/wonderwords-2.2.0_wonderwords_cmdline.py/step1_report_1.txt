{
  "purpose": "This code provides a command-line interface for the Wonderwords package, displaying information and handling user interaction through formatted console output.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package version from __version__ and user input through method calls, though actual input handling is not shown here.",
  "sinks": "Console outputs via rich library functions such as console.print, which display text, markdown, emojis, and styled panels to the user.",
  "flows": "User calls trigger methods like print_title(), intro(), word(), etc., which generate styled console outputs based on input parameters; no external or untrusted data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or suspicious behaviors. The only imported modules are from 'rich' for UI presentation and a version attribute. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a straightforward CLI display module, utilizing the rich library to format and output text, panels, and markdown. It reads the version number from a module attribute and uses emojis and styles for UI. No input handling, data fetching, or external network operations are present. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The logic is simple display functions, and no potential attack vectors are observable within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI presentation module with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It only formats and outputs text and markdown to the console for user interaction, with no external data flows or security risks.",
