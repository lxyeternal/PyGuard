{
  "purpose": "This source code provides command-line interface (CLI) functions for the Wonderwords package, mainly for displaying information and commands to the user.",
  "sources": "Reads the module attribute __version__, input strings like words and sent, and the global AVAILABLE_COMMANDS string.",
  "sinks": "Console output functions (console.print) which display text, including dynamic content such as words, sentences, and version information.",
  "flows": "Sources like __version__, words, and sentences flow into console.print functions that output to the terminal. User inputs are not directly processed here.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code. The code uses standard library functions and third-party library (rich) for formatting output. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a CLI class with methods to display various messages and formatted text using the rich library. It accesses a module attribute __version__ and displays static and dynamic content. No input validation, data processing, or external data fetching is present. No suspicious behavior, no hidden code, and no insecure practices observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI display utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It primarily handles presentation logic without external data processing or sensitive data handling.",
