{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package that provides random word and sentence generation functionality, likely for use in other applications or scripts.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing classes from local modules (.random_word, .random_sentence). No external data sources or user input handling observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform any I/O operations.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only imports modules and sets metadata variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets (except for author and email info, which are typical), or suspicious code behaviors detected. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or external communications.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module with import statements and metadata declarations. It does not contain any logic, data processing, or security-sensitive operations. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code snippets are present. The presence of author and license info is standard for open-source packages. The module appears benign and intended for legitimate functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign part of an open-source project, providing random word and sentence generation. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks based on this snippet.",
