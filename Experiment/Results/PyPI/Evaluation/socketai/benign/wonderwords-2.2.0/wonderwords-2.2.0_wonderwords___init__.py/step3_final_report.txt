{
  "purpose": "Module initialization and package metadata declaration.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.random_word, .random_sentence); metadata variables (__author__, __copyright__, etc.).",
  "sinks": "None; no external data input, network calls, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Import statements and metadata declarations are static; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of functions, data processing, or dynamic code execution; standard package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package __init__.py or module metadata file, importing local modules and defining metadata variables. No suspicious patterns, external data handling, or malicious code are present. The import statements are local, and the metadata is static, indicating a benign package setup. No obfuscation, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are evident. The security risk and malware scores should reflect the benign, static nature of this code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as a standard package initialization with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature. The malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and the security risk score should be very low (around 0.0 to 0.1), consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of external interactions.",
