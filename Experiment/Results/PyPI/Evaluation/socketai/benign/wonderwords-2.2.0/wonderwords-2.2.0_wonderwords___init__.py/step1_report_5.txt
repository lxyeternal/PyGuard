{
  "purpose": "This code imports classes and constants related to random word and sentence generation, likely for use in a text generation or testing tool.",
  "sources": "Import statements for .random_word and .random_sentence modules; metadata variables such as author, copyright, license, email.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no handling of untrusted input, no network operations, no data output or storage.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code only imports modules and sets metadata variables.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, obfuscated elements, or suspicious constructs; straightforward module import and metadata assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements from relative modules and metadata declarations such as author, license, email, and version. No data is processed, no external communication occurs, and there are no signs of malicious or suspicious logic. It appears to be a standard module initializer or metadata file with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as an import and metadata declaration for a text generation package. There is no evidence of malware, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities.",
