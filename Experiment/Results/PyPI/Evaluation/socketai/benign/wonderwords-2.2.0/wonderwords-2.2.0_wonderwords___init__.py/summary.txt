  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as a standard package initialization with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature. The malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and the security risk score should be very low (around 0.0 to 0.1), consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of external interactions."
