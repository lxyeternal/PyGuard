  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a benign, standard Python CLI entry point with no inherent security issues. The assigned scores in the reports are reasonable; malware and obfuscated scores should remain at zero, and the overall risk score should be minimal (~0.1), acknowledging the dependency on external code. No modifications are necessary based on this review."
