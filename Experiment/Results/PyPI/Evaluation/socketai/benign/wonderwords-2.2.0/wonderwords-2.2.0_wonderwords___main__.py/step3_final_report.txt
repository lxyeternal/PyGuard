  "purpose": "Minimal Python CLI entry point that delegates execution to a main() function in a local module.",
  "sources": "Import statement for .cmdline_parser and the __name__ == '__main__' check.",
  "sinks": "None in this snippet; actual behavior depends on cmdline_parser.main().",
  "flows": "Import of main() from local module, then execution when __name__ == '__main__'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python script entry point, importing a main() function and executing it if run directly. No suspicious constructs, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. The security implications depend entirely on the implementation of main() in cmdline_parser, which is not provided. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this snippet, assigning malware=0 and obfuscated=0. The risk scores are low (around 0.1-0.2), reflecting the dependency on external code. Given the minimal and standard pattern, the code itself poses no security threat. The overall assessment is that the code is safe, and the scores are appropriate, with the understanding that actual security depends on the external main() implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a benign, standard Python CLI entry point with no inherent security issues. The assigned scores in the reports are reasonable; malware and obfuscated scores should remain at zero, and the overall risk score should be minimal (~0.1), acknowledging the dependency on external code. No modifications are necessary based on this review.",
