{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the 'wonderwords' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'PYPI.md' for long_description; reads package requirements from 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flows into insecure or untrusted destinations.",
  "flows": "No suspicious data flow paths from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed. The only dependency version specification appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and reads a Markdown file for description, then calls setuptools.setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. The 'install_requires' line specifies a dependency with a conditional version constraint. All code appears typical for package setup scripts. No suspicious or malicious logic, obfuscation, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or suspicious data flows.",
