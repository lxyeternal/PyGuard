{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for the 'wonderwords' Python package, used for packaging and distributing the library.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'PYPI.md' file for long description; package data files in 'assets/*.txt'; package metadata fields such as name, version, author, etc.",
  "sinks": "Installation of dependencies; execution of setup function which prepares package for distribution",
  "flows": "Reading 'PYPI.md' content -> setup configuration -> dependency installation based on environment -> package creation",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic code execution; only standard setup procedures",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup with setuptools, including reading a markdown file for description and specifying dependencies, package data, and entry points. There are no unusual or suspicious code patterns, no data leaks, no external network connections, or malicious behaviors observed. The only dependency conditionally installed is a known package, and no other runtime code or user input is processed. All code appears to follow standard packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware or obfuscated code and poses no threat based on the provided content.",
