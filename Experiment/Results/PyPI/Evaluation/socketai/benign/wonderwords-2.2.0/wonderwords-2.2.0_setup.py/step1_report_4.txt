  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'wonderwords' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading 'PYPI.md' for long description, defining package setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks detected; dependencies are specified explicitly.",
  "flows": "The long description read from a file is used in package metadata; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code structures are present. The dependencies and package data appear typical.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools setup procedure to configure a Python package. It reads a markdown file for description, specifies package info, dependencies, and console entry points. The dependencies are standard and version-specific, with no signs of obfuscated code, malicious code, or malicious behavior. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or credential handling is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate setup configuration for a Python package.",
