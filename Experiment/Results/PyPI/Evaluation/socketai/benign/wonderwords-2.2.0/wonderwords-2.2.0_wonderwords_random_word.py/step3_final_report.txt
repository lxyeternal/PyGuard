{
  "purpose": "The code provides a utility for generating and filtering random words from predefined or custom lists, loaded from static package resources.",
  "sources": "Reads word lists from static text files within package assets using 'pkg_resources.open_text'.",
  "sinks": "Uses standard Python 'random' functions for selecting words; no external communication or data transmission occurs.",
  "flows": "Loads static data into memory, filters based on criteria, and randomly selects words without external or network interaction.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a word generator, loading static resources, filtering with regex and length constraints, and selecting random words. It does not perform any network activity, code injection, or obfuscation. The reliance on external assets is typical for such utilities and does not indicate malicious intent. The use of standard libraries and clear structure further supports its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign word generation utility with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the original reports are appropriate and justified.",
