  "purpose": "The code provides a class and functions for generating random words from predefined or custom lists, with filtering options.",
  "sources": "File reading from package resources to load default word lists; reading user-specified text files; internal data structures holding word lists.",
  "sinks": "Use of random.choice and random.shuffle to select words; reading text files for default lists; potential exposure if assets contain malicious data.",
  "flows": "Loading default word lists from package resources -> Filtering words based on criteria -> Selecting random words from filtered list.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; use of package resource reading is standard; no obfuscated code or hidden network activity.",
  "analysis": "The script defines classes and functions for managing and filtering lists of words, with flexible options for criteria. The code reads word data from text files within package assets, using standard resource loading methods. The randomization is done via Python's 'random' module. There are no indications of code injection, data leaks, or malicious behavior. No suspicious external connections, data exfiltration, or system modifications are present. The code's structure and logic are straightforward, and no obfuscated or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for generating and filtering random words. It employs standard practices for file reading, data filtering, and random selection without any signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
