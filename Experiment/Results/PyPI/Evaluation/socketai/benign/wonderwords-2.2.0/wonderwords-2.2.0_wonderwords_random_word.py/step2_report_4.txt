  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine if the issues are valid, consistent, and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code loads word lists from static assets, filters, and randomly selects words. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies that the code reads static files and uses standard library functions for filtering and random selection. No suspicious behaviors, code injection, or malicious patterns are present. The low risk score (0.2) seems reasonable given the benign nature. The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes safe file reading, filtering, and random selection, with no external communication or malicious code.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the analysis aligns with the code's behavior. No malware or malicious intent is evident. The very low risk score (0.1) is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code reads from package resources, filters, and randomly picks words. No suspicious patterns or obfuscated code.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is consistent. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity. The risk score remains low and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar observations—loading from static files, filtering, and selecting randomly. No suspicious or malicious patterns.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe conclusion is consistent with the code's behavior. No malware or malicious intent detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code reads from package resources, filters, and randomly selects words. No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAll observations are accurate. The code is a benign utility with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious actions—no network activity, no code injection, no backdoors, no obfuscated code.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variations (0.1-0.2) are reasonable given the code's function—loading static files and random selection—without external inputs or dangerous operations.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n**Malware score:** **0** — No signs of malicious behavior.  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0** — Code is clear, well-structured, and not obfuscated.  \n**Risk score:** **0.1** — Minimal risk, mainly related to potential misuse of word lists, but inherently safe.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard, benign word generation utility with no security or malicious concerns. The scoring aligns with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary.",
