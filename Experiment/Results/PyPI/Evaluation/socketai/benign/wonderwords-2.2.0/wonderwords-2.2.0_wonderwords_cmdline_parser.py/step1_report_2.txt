{
  "purpose": "The code provides a command-line interface for generating random words and sentences, with various filters and options.",
  "sources": "User input via command-line arguments; none of the code reads external data sources or untrusted input beyond CLI parameters.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes to external systems, network, or files. It calls functions that presumably generate words and sentences internally.",
  "flows": "User inputs CLI arguments -> get_mode() determines operation -> handle_mode() executes commands -> outputs are handled by WonderwordsCommandLine methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or misleading variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily parses command-line arguments and dispatches functions from imported modules (RandomWord, RandomSentence, WonderwordsCommandLine). There is no evidence of network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious manipulation. Usage of external modules appears benign. The code does not process untrusted data beyond user inputs, and all external modules are part of the intended functionality. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present in logic, imports, or control flow.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a CLI frontend for word and sentence generation, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The structure and flow are typical for CLI tools. No malicious intent or security threats are evident.",
