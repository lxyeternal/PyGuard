  "purpose": "Command-line interface for generating random words and sentences with various filtering and formatting options, intended for user interaction and utility.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via argparse, imports local modules (.random_word, .random_sentence, .cmdline), and uses these to generate output based on user input.",
  "sinks": "Calls methods on WonderwordsCommandLine, RandomWord, and RandomSentence objects which generate and display output; no untrusted data flows into system commands or network operations.",
  "flows": "User inputs (command-line args) -> argument parsing -> mode determination -> method calls on parser objects -> output display via command_line methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious network or system calls. The code strictly handles user input and invokes functions from local modules. No suspicious data leaks or backdoors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up an argument parser, determines operational mode based on inputs, and calls corresponding methods on imported classes to generate or display random words or sentences. No external network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious logic are present. The modules imported (.random_word, .random_sentence, .cmdline) are local and likely provide the core functionality, but from this code alone, there is no evidence of malicious activity. The code performs standard argument handling, control flow, and method invocation without any suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions as a CLI utility for word and sentence generation, with no apparent malicious or sabotage code. It adheres to normal patterns for command-line tools and does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks within this code fragment.",
