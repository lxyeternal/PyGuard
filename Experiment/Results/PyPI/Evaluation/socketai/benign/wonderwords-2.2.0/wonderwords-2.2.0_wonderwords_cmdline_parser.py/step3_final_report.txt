  "purpose": "CLI tool for generating random words and sentences with filtering options.",
  "sources": "User input via argparse, command-line arguments",
  "sinks": "Output to console via command_line methods",
  "flows": "Arguments parsed -> Mode determined -> Delegated to internal classes -> Results output",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward command-line interface that parses user arguments to generate random words or sentences using external modules. It handles different modes such as 'word', 'filter', 'list', and 'sentence', delegating core functionality to imported classes. Exception handling is appropriate, and no network, file, or environment variable manipulations are present. The structure is standard, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. External modules are assumed safe, but their internal security cannot be verified here. Overall, the code is benign, well-structured, and free from security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility for text generation, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are accurate and justified based on the analysis.",
