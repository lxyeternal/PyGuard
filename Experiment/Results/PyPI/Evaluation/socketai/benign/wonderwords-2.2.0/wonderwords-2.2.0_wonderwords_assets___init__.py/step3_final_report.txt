  "sources": "Input from environment variables, user input, file reads, environment variables, network functions, system commands, eval()/exec() calls.",
  "sinks": "System command execution, file writing, network transmission, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data sources flow into system commands, eval()/exec(), network functions, and file operations.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval()/exec(), complex or obfuscated code, unsafe functions, use of untrusted inputs, potential hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code contains untrusted data sources feeding into system commands and eval()/exec(), indicating potential for code injection or malicious execution. Obfuscation is suspected due to dynamic code patterns and complex constructs. The benign code snippets show no suspicious activity, while the suspicious code demonstrates unsafe practices that could be exploited. The scores reflect these observations, with higher malware and obfuscation scores assigned to code with unsafe functions and dynamic execution. The overall security risk is moderate, justified by the unsafe handling of untrusted data and potential for malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "Benign code snippets are correctly scored with minimal risk. The suspicious code exhibits unsafe practices and obfuscation, warranting moderate concern. The scores are consistent with the described behaviors, and no unjustified high scores are present. The overall assessment indicates low risk for benign code and moderate risk for potentially unsafe code, aligning with the provided descriptions.",
