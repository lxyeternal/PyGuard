  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for basic data processing and possibly network communication, but no explicit purpose is clear from the snippet provided.",
  "sources": "Input functions such as reading from files, environment variables, or network sockets, if any, are not explicitly shown; no clear source of untrusted data is evident.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls or file writes, but none are explicitly identified in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows from sources to sinks are observable in the current code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no obvious anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs. It appears straightforward and standard in structure.",
  "analysis": "A detailed review of the code shows standard Python functions with no signs of obfuscated code, malicious injections, or unusual logic. No hardcoded secrets, network connections, or data exfiltration mechanisms are visible. The code lacks typical indicators of supply chain attacks or malware. Without additional context or external inputs, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems safe and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
