  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for a Python package that may perform some data processing or utility functions, but the specific purpose cannot be determined definitively from the provided snippet.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, configuration files, or external data files if any are present, but none are explicitly visible in the snippet. No clear data input functions are shown.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could involve network communication, file writing, or system commands if present, but none are explicitly detected in the provided code segment.",
  "flows": "Without explicit data flow pathways shown, it is not possible to definitively identify source-to-sink flows. The code does not demonstrate untrusted data handling or propagation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network addresses, or hidden backdoors are evident. The code structure and variable usage appear standard. No obfuscated or unusual language features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, utilizing standard Python syntax and libraries. There are no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network connections to suspicious domains, or system manipulations. Usage of third-party libraries is typical and does not indicate malicious intent. No evidence of malware or malicious logic is observed. The code lacks obfuscation and appears clean.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious data flows or anomalies detected. The overall security risk is low.",
