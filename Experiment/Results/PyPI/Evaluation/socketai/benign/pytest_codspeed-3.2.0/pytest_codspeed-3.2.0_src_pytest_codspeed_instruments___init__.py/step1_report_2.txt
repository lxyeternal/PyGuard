{
  "purpose": "Define abstract classes and functions for instrumentation measurement modes, including instrument retrieval based on mode.",
  "sources": "Imports (from __future__, abc, enum, typing, pytest, pytest_codspeed), class definitions, function definitions, conditional import statements.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions; code mainly defines abstract classes and mode-based class retrieval.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior observed. All imports and code are standard for a plugin-like module.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes abstract classes for instrumentation tools, uses type annotations, and dynamically imports specific instrument classes based on measurement mode. No evidence of data exfiltration, malicious behavior, or sabotage mechanisms. The dynamic import is typical for plugin architecture, and no untrusted data handling or suspicious actions are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-structured component defining an interface and a factory function for instrumentation measurement modes. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware. No security risks identified.",
