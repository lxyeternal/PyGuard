{
  "purpose": "Defines abstract classes and functions for instrumentation measurement modes, including configuration and measurement methods.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, abc, enum, typing, and conditional imports within TYPE_CHECKING.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No identifiable source-to-sink data flow; code primarily defines classes and functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The import statements and function definitions are standard. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code provides an interface for measurement instruments with abstract methods, defines an enumeration for measurement modes, and a function to select the appropriate instrument class based on mode. The imports are conditional and only for type checking. No external data processing, network operations, or code execution beyond class and function definitions. The structure is standard and does not exhibit suspicious patterns or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard interface definition for measurement instruments in a pytest plugin context. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from this code segment.",
