{
  "purpose": "Defines abstract classes, enums, and a factory function for selecting instrumentation classes based on measurement modes within a plugin architecture.",
  "sources": "Conditional imports for type checking, class definitions, and the get_instrument_from_mode factory function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external data handling or network activity.",
  "flows": "The factory function uses mode to select class references; no dynamic code execution or data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward plugin interface with conditional imports, abstract class definitions, and a simple factory function. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation are present. The scores across reports are consistent, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0 and minimal risk scores justified by the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, well-structured, and free of malicious or security-threatening features. The low risk scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
