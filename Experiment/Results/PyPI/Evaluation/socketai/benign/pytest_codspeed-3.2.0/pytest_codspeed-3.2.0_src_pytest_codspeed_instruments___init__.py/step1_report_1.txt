{
  "purpose": "Defines abstract classes and functions for measuring and instrumenting code, including a factory function for selecting instrumentation based on mode.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, type hints, and conditional import of pytest and plugin modules.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data output or network activity.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted inputs; code mainly defines classes, functions, and control flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract base class 'Instrument' with several abstract methods, an enum 'MeasurementMode', and a factory function 'get_instrument_from_mode' that conditionally imports instrument classes and returns one based on the mode. The imports are standard, and the conditional import is typical for modular design. No code appears to perform malicious actions, leak data, or contain backdoors. The code structure and syntax are normal, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard design for measurement instrumentation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and straightforward.",
