{
  "purpose": "Define abstract base class for instrumentation, measurement modes, and a factory function to select instrument classes based on mode.",
  "sources": "Imports (standard libraries, typing, pytest), class and function definitions, conditional imports within TYPE_CHECKING",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code mainly defines classes and functions without executing external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; the code structure and logic appear standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up an abstract class 'Instrument' with several abstract methods, an enum 'MeasurementMode', and a function 'get_instrument_from_mode' that returns specific instrument classes based on the mode. Imports are standard; conditional import under TYPE_CHECKING is common for type hints. No use of dynamic code execution, network activity, or credential handling. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code present. The structure and logic are typical for a plugin-based architecture. No indicators of malicious intent or sabotage are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, well-structured module defining interfaces and factory functions for instrumentation. It contains no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears safe and primarily serves as part of a larger, plugin-based system.",
