  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issue presence:** No issues detected; code is straightforward class and function definitions.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None identified.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — reasonable.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious or suspicious behavior, no data leaks, no obfuscation.  \n- **Overall:** Safe, standard design.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issue presence:** No issues; standard pattern for plugin architecture.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious intent, no data handling beyond class selection.  \n- **Overall:** Safe, well-structured.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issue presence:** No issues; abstract classes, enums, and factory function are typical.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — justified.  \n- **Justification:** No data leaks, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious patterns.  \n- **Overall:** Safe and standard.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issue presence:** No issues; code defines interfaces and selection logic.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 — slightly above zero but justified given the slight uncertainty about potential indirect risks.  \n- **Justification:** No direct malicious behavior, but the mention of \"no external input\" and \"benign\" nature aligns with a low security risk.  \n- **Overall:** Very low risk, no malware.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issue presence:** No issues; standard interface and factory pattern.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Justification:** No suspicious activity, no data leaks, no obfuscation.  \n- **Overall:** Safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** Nearly all reports assign 0, with one (Report 4) at 0.1, which is reasonable given the minimal uncertainty.\n\n**My own assessment:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malware.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.  \n- **Risk:** 0.05 — very low, considering the code is purely structural and interface definitions with no external data handling or execution.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent and reasonable. No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risk is present in this code snippet. The low risk score in Report 4 is justified, but overall, the code appears safe.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Maintain malware and obfuscated scores at 0.  \n- Set overall security risk around 0.05 to reflect the minimal, theoretical concerns.",
