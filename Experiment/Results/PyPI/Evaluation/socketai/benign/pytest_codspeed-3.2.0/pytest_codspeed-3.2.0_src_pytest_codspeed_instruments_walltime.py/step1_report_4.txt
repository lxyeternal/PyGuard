{
  "purpose": "This code implements a benchmarking instrument for measuring wall-clock time of functions, collecting statistical data, and reporting results via a terminal interface.",
  "sources": "Data is read from function calls, performance counters (perf_counter_ns), and configuration objects (CodSpeedConfig).",
  "sinks": "Output is sent to terminal through the rich library (Console, Table), and benchmark results are stored in in-memory data structures.",
  "flows": "Function outputs are measured via perf_counter_ns calls, data is processed into Benchmark and BenchmarkStats objects, then displayed or returned as dicts.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data classes for configuration and statistics, performs timing-based benchmarking with warmup and multiple rounds, and reports results via terminal. The timing measurements and data collection appear standard and do not involve external or untrusted data sources. The use of rich for display is for visualization and does not pose security concerns. There are no signs of malicious intent such as network activity, data leaks, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate benchmarking utility focused on measuring and reporting function execution times. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. All functionalities are typical for performance measurement tools, and there are no signs of sabotage or malware.",
