{
  "purpose": "This code defines a benchmarking tool using Python's perf_counter to measure execution time of functions, providing statistical analysis and report generation for performance metrics.",
  "sources": "Data is read from function calls, performance counters, and configuration objects.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that process untrusted data leading to security vulnerabilities are present; output is mainly to console and internal data structures.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function executions and performance counters into statistical calculations and report generation, with no external data injection or untrusted input processing identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are detected. The code performs standard benchmarking operations with typical libraries (math, statistics, time, rich).",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured benchmarking framework that measures function execution times, computes statistical summaries, and displays results via terminal tables. It uses safe, well-known libraries and typical patterns. No obfuscated or suspicious constructs, external network communications, or malicious behaviors are observed. It reads configuration and performance data locally, with no indication of data leakage, privilege escalation, or hidden actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate benchmarking tool without malicious intent or security risks. It strictly measures performance metrics and reports them locally. No indicators of malware or security vulnerabilities are identified.",
