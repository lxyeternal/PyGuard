{
  "purpose": "This code implements a benchmarking tool for measuring and reporting wall-clock time performance of functions, including warm-up and statistical analysis.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (math, statistics, time), third-party libraries (rich, pytest), and configuration data from CodSpeedConfig. Data input occurs when functions are called with arguments.",
  "sinks": "Function execution and timing are monitored, but no data is sent to external locations or stored insecurely. No external data leaks or system modifications are observed.",
  "flows": "Inputs (function args, config) → run_benchmark (timing and executing functions) → collecting timing data → reporting results via rich library → output of benchmark statistics.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden data leaks. Use of standard libraries for performance measurement and report generation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data classes for configuration and statistics, runs benchmarks with warmup and timed rounds, calculates statistical measures, and reports via terminal. All parts involve standard performance measurement procedures. No signs of malicious actions such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The imports and class structures are typical for a benchmarking tool, with no suspicious code flow or anomalies identified. The functions perform their intended tasks securely and transparently.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard benchmarking utility for performance measurement with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It collects timing data and reports results locally without external data leakage or harmful actions.",
