  "purpose": "A performance benchmarking utility measuring function execution times using system clock, statistical analysis, and terminal reporting.",
  "sources": "Function calls, configuration objects, system clock info",
  "sinks": "Terminal output, in-memory data structures, returned dicts",
  "flows": "Function execution data flows into statistical calculations and terminal reports",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard benchmarking: timing function calls, calculating statistics, and reporting results. It uses common libraries (rich, statistics, math), with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation. The structure is clear, with no signs of malicious behavior or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent benchmarking tool with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It operates solely within performance measurement scope, with no external data leaks or malicious behaviors.",
