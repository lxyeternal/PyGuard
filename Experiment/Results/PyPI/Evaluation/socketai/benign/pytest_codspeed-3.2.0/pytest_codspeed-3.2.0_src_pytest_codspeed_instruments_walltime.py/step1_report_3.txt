{
  "purpose": "The code implements a benchmarking tool for measuring wall time performance of functions, with configurations and statistical analysis, and generates reports in terminal format.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include function arguments, configuration objects, and system clock info.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include output to terminal (via rich library), data stored in class attributes, and returned dictionaries containing benchmark data.",
  "flows": "Input arguments flow into benchmark functions; benchmark results are stored in class attributes and outputted via terminal printing and data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. Usage of system clock info and data classes is standard. No suspicious network activity or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of performance benchmarking using perf_counter_ns for timing. It performs warmup, multiple rounds of function execution, computes statistical measures, and reports results using the rich library. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code relies on standard libraries and third-party packages for reporting but does not exhibit suspicious or malicious behavior. The statistical analysis and report generation are typical for benchmarking tools. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation are identified. The structure is clear and consistent with performance measurement utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a legitimate benchmarking utility with no malicious intent or behavior. It performs performance measurements and report generation using standard techniques and libraries. No indicators of malware or security risks are found.",
