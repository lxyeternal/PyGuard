  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for path and environment info collection with no security issues. The assessments in the reports are accurate. The malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and risk score approximately 0, with a very slight increase (0.1) justified by minimal environment data exposure. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for its purpose."
