{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for handling git repository paths, generating relative URIs for pytest nodes, and collecting environment metadata.",
  "sources": "os.getpid(), sysconfig.get_config_vars(), importlib_metadata.distributions()",
  "sinks": "os.getpid() (exposed in environment metadata), no external data sinks or network communication observed",
  "flows": "The environment metadata is collected and structured into a dictionary; no data flows into external systems or outputs",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code uses standard library functions and common third-party library calls without unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard imports and functions to retrieve environment details, paths relative to git repositories, and pytest node information. It avoids unsafe operations, hardcoded secrets, or network activity. The functions are well-structured, and the only potentially sensitive data accessed are process IDs, environment configurations, and file paths, all handled securely within the local environment.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs benign utility operations related to project metadata and path resolution. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or malicious code present. The functions rely on standard libraries and common practices without any suspicious behavior.",
