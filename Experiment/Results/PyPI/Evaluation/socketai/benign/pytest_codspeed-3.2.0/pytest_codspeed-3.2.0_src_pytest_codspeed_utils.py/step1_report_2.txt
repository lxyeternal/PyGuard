  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for handling git-relative paths, parsing pytest node IDs, and gathering environment metadata.",
  "sources": "os.getpid(), sysconfig.get_config_vars(), importlib_metadata.distributions(), Path and file existence checks in get_git_relative_path()",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data flows into dangerous operations or external systems.",
  "flows": "Input from nodeid and pytest_rootdir flows into get_git_relative_uri_and_name, which calls get_git_relative_path, ultimately used for generating relative paths and URIs; environment metadata collection gathers data from system functions and package distributions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard Python modules for path manipulation, environment info, and metadata extraction. It checks the Python version for conditional imports, retrieves git-relative paths, and assembles environment info including process ID and installed dependencies. All operations are benign, with no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility module for environment and path management within a pytest-based benchmarking context. No malicious behavior or security issues are detected.",
