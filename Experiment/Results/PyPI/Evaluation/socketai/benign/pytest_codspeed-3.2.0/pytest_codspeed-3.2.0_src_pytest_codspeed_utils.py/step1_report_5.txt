  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for handling file paths relative to a git repository, parsing pytest node IDs, and gathering environment metadata.",
  "sources": "os.getpid(), sysconfig.get_config_vars(), importlib_metadata.distributions(), Path methods, and file existence checks.",
  "sinks": "None of the sources are used directly in sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions. No untrusted data is written to external systems or used insecurely.",
  "flows": "Input from environment variables or filesystem checks is used only internally for path manipulations and metadata collection, with no external data flows that could be exploited.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behavior are detected. The functions perform standard operations related to file paths, package metadata, and environment info.",
  "analysis": "The script uses common Python modules and standard practices to determine git-relative paths, extract pytest node info, and compile environment metadata. No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or network activity are present. The code is straightforward and focused on data collection, with no indications of malicious intent or obfuscated logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving utility functions for testing and environment reporting. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident, and it does not pose security risks.",
