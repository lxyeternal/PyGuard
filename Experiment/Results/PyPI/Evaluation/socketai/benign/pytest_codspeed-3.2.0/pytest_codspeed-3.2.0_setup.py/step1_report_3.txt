  "purpose": "Configure and build a native extension for the pytest_codspeed package based on the system platform and environment variables.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (PYTEST_CODSPEED_FORCE_EXTENSION_BUILD, PYTEST_CODSPEED_SKIP_EXTENSION_BUILD), platform info (system, architecture), and imports a build script from a specific file path.",
  "sinks": "None of the sources lead directly to potentially dangerous sinks; the code mainly performs platform checks and module setup.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and platform info influence whether the extension is built or skipped, affecting setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically imports a build script from a relative path, which could be manipulated if the file system is compromised; however, this is typical for build scripts and not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports and executes a build script dynamically, performs platform and environment variable checks, and configures build options accordingly. No network activity, data exfiltration, or suspicious code patterns are present. The dynamic import from a local build.py file is typical in build processes and does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials or unusual behavior detected. The environment checks prevent incompatible builds on unsupported platforms.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate build configuration script for a Python extension, with no apparent malicious behavior or security risks. Its purpose is to facilitate conditional building of native extensions based on platform and environment variables. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident.",
