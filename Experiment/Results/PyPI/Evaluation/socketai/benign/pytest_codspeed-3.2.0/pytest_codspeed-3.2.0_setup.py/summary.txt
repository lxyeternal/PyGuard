  "conclusion": "The script is a standard build configuration that dynamically imports and executes an external script ('build.py') without validation, which introduces a potential security risk if the external script is malicious or compromised. No malicious activity is observed in the code itself, but the execution of external code without validation warrants caution. The assigned malware score should be low (around 0.1-0.2), and the security risk score should be moderate (~0.3), reflecting the potential vector for malicious activity. To mitigate risks, validating or sandboxing the external script is recommended."
