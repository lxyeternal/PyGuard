  "purpose": "Define version information and export a class from a plugin module",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and import statement for BenchmarkFixture",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code mainly declares constants and imports",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code consists of setting version variables, importing a class from a local module, and defining __all__ for exports. It does not process user input, handle network connections, or execute dynamic code. No signs of malicious intent or obfuscation are present. The code is straightforward, typical for module initialization.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard module setup with version info and class export; no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
