  "purpose": "Define version information and import a local class for module setup.",
  "sources": "Static version strings (__version__, __semver_version__), import of .plugin.BenchmarkFixture.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, no data leaks, no network activity, no dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static assignment and import only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static version strings and a local import, with no user input, network activity, or dynamic code. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, with high confidence. No anomalies or malicious behavior are present. The code is standard for package initialization and version declaration, with no vulnerabilities or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security risk. All reports and scores are accurate and justified.",
