  "purpose": "Defines version information and exports a class for external use",
  "sources": "None; no input reading, environment variables, or data sources are present",
  "sinks": "None; no output, network, or data leaks occur",
  "flows": "No data flows from any source to sink; the code only sets variables and imports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; simple version assignment and import statements",
  "analysis": "The code assigns static version strings and imports a class from a relative module. It then exposes these via __all__. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data handling is present. No suspicious behavior or malicious patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward module defining version info and exporting a class, with no malicious or security concerns.",
