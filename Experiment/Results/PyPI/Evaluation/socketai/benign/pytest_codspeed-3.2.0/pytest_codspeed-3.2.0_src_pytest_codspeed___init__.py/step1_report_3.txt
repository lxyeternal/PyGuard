{
  "purpose": "Define version information and export a class from a local plugin module",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings, import of BenchmarkFixture from a local module",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data processing or external data sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; simple assignment and import statements",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or unusual code behavior; version strings are standard",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets version metadata and imports a class from a local module. The version strings are hardcoded but benign. The import statement is a normal practice for modular Python code. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, code execution, or obfuscation. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is straightforward, containing only version declarations and a local import. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
