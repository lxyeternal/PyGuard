  "purpose": "Define version information and export the BenchmarkFixture class for external use.",
  "sources": "Constants __version__, __semver_version__, and the imported module .plugin",
  "targets": "The imported class BenchmarkFixture and the exported variables",
  "flows": "The version variables and imported module are set at the start; no data flow leading to security risks are apparent",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code solely declares version strings and imports a class from a relative module. It then exports these for external use. No user input, network operations, or data processing occurs. The import of a local plugin class is standard and does not indicate malicious intent. The version strings are hardcoded but benign. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is straightforward module metadata and import/export code with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
