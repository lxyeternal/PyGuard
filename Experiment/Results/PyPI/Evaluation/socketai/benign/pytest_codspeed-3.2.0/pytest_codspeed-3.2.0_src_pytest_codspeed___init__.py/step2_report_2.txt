  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, with no dynamic or malicious behavior.\n- The code consists solely of version string assignments and import statements.\n- No user input, network activity, or data processing occurs.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### **Specific review of each report:**\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Assessment:** Correct; the code is benign, no malicious or security issues.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Confidence:** 1.0 (fully confident).  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate, no change needed.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Assessment:** Correct; no malicious behavior, just metadata and import.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Confidence:** 1.0.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate, no change needed.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Assessment:** Correct; straightforward version info and import.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Confidence:** 1.0.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate, no change needed.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Assessment:** Correct; no suspicious activity, just version and import.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Confidence:** 1.0.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate, no change needed.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Assessment:** Correct; standard package versioning and import.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Confidence:** 1.0.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate, no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary and overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; all are zero.  \n- **Risk score:** The code is trivial and safe, so zero is appropriate.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n- The code does not contain any dynamic code, code injection, or suspicious patterns.\n- Assigning higher scores would imply malicious intent or obfuscation, which is unjustified here.\n- The reports' reasoning is sound, and their scores are consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- **Scores:** Keep all malware, obfuscated, and securityRisk scores at 0.\n- **Estimated overall scores:**  \n  - **Malware:** 0  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0  \n  - **Risk:** 0\n\n**The code is benign, and the reports are accurate.**",
