  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to ensure consistency and correctness.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a very simple module that defines version strings and imports a class from a local module.\n- No user input, network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation is present.\n- All reports conclude that there are no malicious or security concerns.\n- All scores are set to 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, with confidence at 1.0.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Code correctness:**  \n  The code is straightforward: static version strings, import of a class, and __all__ declaration.  \n  No issues or errors are present.\n\n- **Malicious behavior:**  \n  No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious code snippets. The import is from a local module, which is standard.\n\n- **Obfuscation:**  \n  The code is not obfuscated; it’s clear and readable.\n\n- **Security risk:**  \n  No data leaks, no untrusted data handling, no network activity, no secrets.\n\n---\n\n### Critical review of scores:\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  All reports assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, with confidence=1.0.  \n  This aligns with the analysis: the code is benign and straightforward.\n\n- **Potential for higher risk scores?**  \n  No. The code is purely metadata and import statements.  \n  No reason to assign higher scores.\n\n- **Risk scores > 0.5?**  \n  No, because there's no indication of malicious intent or security issues.\n\n- **Malware score?**  \n  Correctly set to 0. No malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated score?**  \n  Correctly set to 0. The code is not obfuscated.\n\n- **Security risk?**  \n  Correctly 0. No vulnerabilities or risky behaviors.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nGiven all the reports and their reasoning, **the scores are appropriate and consistent** with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n**However, considering the possibility of overlooked issues:**\n\n- The only minor point is that hardcoded version strings are standard, but if this code were part of a supply chain, an attacker could potentially replace the entire module or the imported class. But since the code is static and no dynamic or malicious code is present, this is not a concern here.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n  No malicious code or behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n  Clear, readable code.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0  \n  No security issues.\n\n- **Additional note:**  \n  The code is typical for a package's version and import setup. No vulnerabilities or malicious activity are evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Metric             | Score | Justification                                                      |\n|--------------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| malware            | 0      | No malicious code or behavior present.                              |\n| obfuscated         | 0      | Code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.                 |\n| securityRisk       | 0      | No security vulnerabilities or risky behaviors detected.           |\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate, and the scores are justified.**",
