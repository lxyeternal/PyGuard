  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code snippets are very simple: defining version strings, importing a class, and exporting via `__all__`.\n- No dynamic behavior, user input, environment variables, network activity, or data processing.\n- No obfuscation, no suspicious imports, no hardcoded secrets.\n- All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code matches the description: static version variables, import of `BenchmarkFixture`, and `__all__`.\n- No issues or discrepancies are observed between the code and the reports.\n\n### Error, flaws, or mistakes:\n- No errors or logical flaws are present in the reports.\n- The reasoning in all reports is consistent and correct.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- All reports assign `malware: 0`, which is appropriate.\n- `obfuscated: 0` is correct.\n- `securityRisk: 0` is justified given the benign code.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- The reports assign a `securityRisk` of 0, which is appropriate.\n- The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code.\n- The version strings are hardcoded but benign.\n\n### Critical points:\n- None of the reports suggest any malicious intent or suspicious behavior.\n- The code is standard for module initialization and version declaration.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is straightforward, with no malicious or security concerns.\n- The scores across all reports are reasonable and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, and all reports are accurate in their assessments. No changes to scores or conclusions are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** This is a standard, safe module setup with version info and class import, with no security concerns.",
