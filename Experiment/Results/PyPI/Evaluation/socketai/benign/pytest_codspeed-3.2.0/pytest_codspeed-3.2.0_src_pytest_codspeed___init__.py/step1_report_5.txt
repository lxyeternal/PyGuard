{
  "purpose": "Define package version information and import a plugin component for use elsewhere in the package.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version strings (__version__, __semver_version__), import statement from local module (.plugin)",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or output sinks identified",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the import and variable assignments are static",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists of simple variable assignments and an import statement without dynamic code or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code sets version identifiers with hardcoded strings, which is standard practice for package versioning. It imports a class or function from a local module, which is typical in modular Python packages. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, network activity, or data leakage. The structure and content are straightforward and consistent with package initialization files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving to specify version information and import a plugin component. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
