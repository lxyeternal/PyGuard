  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the original code and applying a critical security perspective.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as straightforward, involving static variable assignments and import statements.\n- No user input, environment variables, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code appears to be standard module setup for versioning and class exporting.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** No issues, no data flow, no anomalies.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score is 0, security risk is 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, emphasizing straightforward import and version declaration.\n- **Score justification:** No malicious activity or vulnerabilities identified.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Similar, with focus on benign import and version assignment.\n- **Score justification:** No issues, malware score remains 0.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior, standard module initialization.\n- **Score justification:** No malware or security risk.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Standard version and import statements, no dynamic or malicious behavior.\n- **Score justification:** Consistent with the previous reports.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity?** No. All reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- **Obfuscation?** No. All code is straightforward.\n- **Scores:**\n  - **Malware:** 0 in all reports. Correct.\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 in all reports. Correct.\n  - **Risk:** 0 in all reports. Correct.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent.\n- The analysis correctly dismisses any potential vulnerabilities based on the static, benign nature of the code.\n- No changes needed; the reports are accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a simple, standard module setup for versioning and class exporting, with no malicious or security concerns. The reports' assessments and scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways remain vigilant for future dynamic or obfuscated code, but in this static context, no issues are present.",
