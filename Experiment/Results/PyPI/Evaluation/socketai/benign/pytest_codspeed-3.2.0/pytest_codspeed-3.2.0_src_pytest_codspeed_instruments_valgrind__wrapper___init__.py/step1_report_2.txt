{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to conditionally import a library module for type checking and runtime use, specifically a wrapper for callgrind.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module import statements and the exception handling block.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external effects; the only dynamic operation is importing a module.",
  "flows": "The import statement inside the try block is the source; it leads to returning the module object, but there are no external sinks or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic. The use of try-except around import is standard for optional dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code uses a conditional import based on TYPE_CHECKING for type hints, which is standard in Python. It attempts to import a specific library module within a try block and raises a generic exception if the import fails. The code does not execute untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain malicious logic. There are no signs of code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The only noteworthy aspect is the dynamic import, which is a common pattern for optional dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical conditional import pattern used for type checking and optional runtime dependencies. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears safe and standard.",
