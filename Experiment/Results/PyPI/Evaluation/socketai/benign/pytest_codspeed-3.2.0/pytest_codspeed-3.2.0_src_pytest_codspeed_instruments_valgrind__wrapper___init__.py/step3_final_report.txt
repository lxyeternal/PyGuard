{
  "purpose": "The code defines a function get_lib() that attempts to import a local module .dist_callgrind_wrapper and return its lib attribute, with exception handling for import failures.",
  "sources": "The import statement within get_lib() that dynamically imports .dist_callgrind_wrapper.lib.",
  "sinks": "The import operation itself; no external data or untrusted sources are involved.",
  "flows": "Source: the import statement; Sink: the return of lib or raising an exception if import fails.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code uses standard conditional import with exception handling, no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward pattern for optional dependency import with type hinting support. It contains no malicious code, secrets, or obfuscation. Exception handling is benign, and the import path is relative and controlled. The minimal security risk stems from dynamic import, but given the controlled environment, this is low. All reports correctly identify the code as safe, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low security risk (~0.1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, standard, and free from malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's behavior. No adjustments are necessary.",
