{
  "purpose": "Provides a function to retrieve a compiled library wrapper, with conditional type hinting and exception handling.",
  "sources": "The import statement for 'lib' from '.dist_callgrind_wrapper' within the get_lib() function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or user input handling, no sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "The function attempts to import 'lib' and return it; on failure, it raises an exception.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements present. Use of try-except for import failure is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports a type for static analysis, then defines a function to import a library dynamically at runtime. If the import fails, an exception is raised. No malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or malicious payloads are detected. The code structure is typical for conditional runtime imports and type hints.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign implementation for importing a library with error handling. No indicators of malicious intent, malware, or security risks are present.",
