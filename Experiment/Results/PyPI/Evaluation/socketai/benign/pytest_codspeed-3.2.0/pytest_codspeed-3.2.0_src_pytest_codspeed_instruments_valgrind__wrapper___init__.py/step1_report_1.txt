{
  "purpose": "Provides a function to import and return a library object, with conditional type hinting for static analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads the import statement and attempts to import a specific module within the function get_lib().",
  "sinks": "The only significant sink is the import statement inside get_lib(), which could potentially load untrusted or malicious code if the module path or the module itself is compromised.",
  "flows": "The flow is from the import statement inside get_lib() to returning the lib object. If an exception occurs, it raises a new exception.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; the import is conditional and standard, and the exception handling is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple conditional type-checking setup with a function to import a specific module. It includes exception handling for import failures. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or signs of malicious intent. The import is dynamic but within a controlled, relative module structure. The exception handling does not perform malicious actions. Overall, the code appears safe, with standard Python practices for optional imports.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a straightforward import operation with exception handling, without any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate utility function for module loading with no malicious intent.",
