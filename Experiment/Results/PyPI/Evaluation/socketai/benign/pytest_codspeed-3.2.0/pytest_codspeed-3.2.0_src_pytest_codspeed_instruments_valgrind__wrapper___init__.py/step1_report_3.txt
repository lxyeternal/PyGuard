{
  "purpose": "The code provides a function to conditionally import and return a library module, likely as part of a larger package, with error handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads an optional type stub from .wrapper and attempts to import a module named .dist_callgrind_wrapper.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks or harmful effects.",
  "flows": "The function get_lib() attempts to import a module and returns it; if import fails, it raises an exception. No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. The code structure is straightforward and uses standard import patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code uses conditional type checking to import type hints. The get_lib() function attempts to import a local module, handling exceptions by raising an error. No malicious or suspicious patterns are present. The import is dynamic but expected for plugin-like systems. No external data is processed or transmitted, and no secrets or sensitive data are handled.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical dynamic import pattern with proper error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code appears safe and standard.",
