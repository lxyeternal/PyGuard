  "purpose": "Define a function to import and return a library object, with error handling.",
  "sources": "The import statement within get_lib() that dynamically imports .dist_callgrind_wrapper.lib.",
  "sinks": "The return statement in get_lib(), which provides access to the imported library object.",
  "flows": "Code attempts to import lib from .dist_callgrind_wrapper when get_lib() is called, then returns it.",
  "anomalies": "Uses dynamic import with exception handling; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code observed. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a function that attempts to import a library module dynamically and return it. It includes a conditional import for type checking and error handling if the import fails. There is no indication of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network connections, or backdoors. The code relies on standard Python import mechanics with exception management. No unusual or suspicious patterns are present beyond standard dynamic import practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard pattern for lazy or conditional importing of a library with proper error handling. No malicious or maliciously intended behavior is evident. It is safe and does not introduce security risks.",
