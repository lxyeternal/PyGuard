{
  "purpose": "This script is used to build and compile a CFFI extension module from provided C header and source files.",
  "sources": "Reads the content of 'wrapper.h' from the same directory as the script.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any direct sinks that execute untrusted data or perform insecure actions.",
  "flows": "Reads header file content -> passes it to cdef -> compiles C source files into a Python extension module.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of external C code and CFFI is standard for extension building.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, constructs a Path object for the current directory, reads the C header file, and sets up a CFFI builder with the header and source files. It then compiles the extension module when run as main. There are no signs of malicious intent, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code performs a standard extension build process using CFFI.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical build script for a Python C extension using CFFI. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It appears safe and straightforward.",
