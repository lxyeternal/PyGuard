{
  "purpose": "This script appears to configure and compile a C foreign function interface (FFI) wrapper for a Python package, likely for performance or system-level interaction.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'wrapper.h' file from the same directory as the script.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "Reads 'wrapper.h' -> uses cdef -> compiles C source files with set_source -> potentially generates extension module.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Path for filesystem navigation, and cffi for interfacing with C code. It reads the 'wrapper.h' header file from the same directory, then uses cffi to define C function prototypes and set up a source for compilation. The set_source call specifies a module name, includes the header, and points to a C source file. The script ends with a compile call if run as main. All operations are standard for creating C extensions via cffi; no malicious behavior or malicious intent is evident. No hardcoded secrets, no data leakage, and no suspicious network activity or code injection is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs typical setup for a C extension using cffi without any indications of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It is a straightforward configuration script for compiling C code to be used in Python.",
