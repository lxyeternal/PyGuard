{
  "purpose": "This code sets up a Python CFFI extension by reading a header file, defining C function signatures, and compiling the extension module.",
  "sources": "Reads 'wrapper.h' for function definitions, and includes 'wrapper.c' as the source code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or network operations; purely local file reading and compilation.",
  "flows": "Reads header file -> defines C functions -> compiles C extension module.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script for creating Python bindings to C code using cffi. It reads a local header file, defines the C interface, and compiles the extension. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code does not handle untrusted input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is zero. The small security risk score of 0.1 in some reports appears to be a conservative default and can be adjusted to zero.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and poses no security threat. All reports correctly identify it as a straightforward build script with no malicious intent. The malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate at zero, and the security risk should be set to zero for consistency.",
