{
  "purpose": "The code sets up and compiles a C Foreign Function Interface (FFI) wrapper using cffi for integration with a C library, likely to facilitate calling C functions from Python.",
  "sources": "Reads the content of 'wrapper.h' file located in the same directory as this script.",
  "sinks": "Uses cffi's compile function to generate a shared library from the provided C source code; no untrusted data is passed directly to sinks.",
  "flows": "Reads 'wrapper.h' -> passes content to cdef() -> set_source() -> compile() to generate shared library.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious dynamic code; code straightforwardly sets up a CFFI binding without unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily loads a header file 'wrapper.h', configures a C source file for compilation, and compiles it into a Python extension module. It uses standard cffi procedures with no user input, network activity, or obfuscated code. The code is structured in a typical manner for setting up C bindings, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup for creating a Python C extension using cffi. It appears benign, with no indicators of malicious intent, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities. It simply reads a header, links a C source, and compiles the extension.",
