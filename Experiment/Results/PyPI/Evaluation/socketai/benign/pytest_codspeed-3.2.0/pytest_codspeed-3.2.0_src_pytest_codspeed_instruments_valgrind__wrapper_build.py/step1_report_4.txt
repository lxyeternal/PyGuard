{
  "purpose": "This script sets up and compiles a CFFI wrapper for a C library, likely for performance or integration with C code within a Python project.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'wrapper.h' file for C definitions, including the wrapper.h header file, and the compilation process of the C source code 'wrapper.c'.",
  "sinks": "The compilation process, which converts C code into a Python-accessible module.",
  "flows": "Reading 'wrapper.h' -> Setting C definitions -> Including 'wrapper.h' -> Compiling 'wrapper.c' into a Python module.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard Python modules and cffi for foreign function interface. It reads C definitions from a local header file, sets source files for compilation, and invokes compilation when run as a script. No external data input, untrusted data handling, or network activity observed. The use of cffi for wrapping C code is typical in extension modules and does not imply malicious intent. The code appears to be a straightforward setup script for a C extension module, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign setup script for compiling a CFFI wrapper module. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, and the code structure is consistent with standard practices for Python-C integration.",
