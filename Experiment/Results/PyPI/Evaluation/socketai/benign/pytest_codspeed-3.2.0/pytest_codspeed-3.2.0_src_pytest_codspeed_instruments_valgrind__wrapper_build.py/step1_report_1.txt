{
  "purpose": "This code initializes and compiles a CFFI wrapper for a C library, likely to enable Python code to interface with C code via generated bindings.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'wrapper.h' file located in the same directory as the script.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processing, network operations, or data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "N/A; code reads a header file and compiles C extension modules without handling untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard CFFI procedures to generate Python bindings for C code. It reads a header file, sets up source compilation with specified C source files and include directories, and compiles the extension if executed as the main program. The code appears straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious side effects. It does not connect to networks, handle untrusted data, or execute dynamic code beyond the standard CFFI compilation process.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a typical build script for CFFI-based Python bindings with no detectable malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and solely aimed at interfacing with C code.",
