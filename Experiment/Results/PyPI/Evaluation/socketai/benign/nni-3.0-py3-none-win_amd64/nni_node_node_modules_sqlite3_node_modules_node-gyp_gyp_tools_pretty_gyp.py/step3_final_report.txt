{
  "purpose": "Pretty-prints the contents of a GYP file by adjusting indentation based on brace matching, comments, and quoted strings.",
  "sources": "Reads input from a file specified as a command-line argument or from stdin.",
  "sinks": "None; the code performs text processing and outputs formatted lines to stdout.",
  "flows": "Input data is read, comments and quotes are masked to prevent misinterpretation, brace counts are calculated, and lines are indented accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; regex masking is solely for formatting purposes, not obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward utility for formatting GYP files, handling comments and quoted strings to correctly indent code based on brace structure. It does not perform any network activity, file modifications beyond reading input, or execute untrusted code. Regex patterns are used for masking comments and quotes, which are standard for such formatting tasks. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or obfuscation patterns are present. The code's purpose is purely aesthetic and structural, with no security vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, utility script for pretty-printing GYP files. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and overall security risk are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
