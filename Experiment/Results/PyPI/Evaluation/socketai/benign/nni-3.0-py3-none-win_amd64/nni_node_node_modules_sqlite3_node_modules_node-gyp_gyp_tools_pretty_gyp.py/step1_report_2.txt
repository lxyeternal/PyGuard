{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to pretty-print and format the contents of a GYP file by handling indentation based on brace matching, comments, and quoted strings.",
  "sources": "Reads input from a file specified as a command-line argument or from stdin; processes the entire input as lines of text.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed in a way that could lead to security vulnerabilities or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input data is read and split into lines; processed to mask comments and quotes; braces are counted to determine indentation; then lines are printed with proper indentation.",
  "anomalies": "The code solely performs text parsing and formatting. No code injection, network operations, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. It contains detailed regex handling but nothing inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script employs regexes to identify comments and quoted strings, masking them to accurately count braces for indentation. It manipulates input lines for pretty-printing based on brace levels. No external data is sent or received, and no code executes untrusted input. The operations are static and purely formatting-oriented. There are no hidden or obfuscated code features; all functions perform standard text processing tasks. Overall, the code appears safe, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior, focusing solely on formatting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign pretty-printer for GYP files, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It is purely for formatting purposes and does not interact with external systems or perform any security-sensitive operations.",
