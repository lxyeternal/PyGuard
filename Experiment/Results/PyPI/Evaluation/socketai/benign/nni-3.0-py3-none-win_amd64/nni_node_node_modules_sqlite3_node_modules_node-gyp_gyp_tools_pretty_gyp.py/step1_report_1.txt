{
  "purpose": "This script is designed to pretty-print and indent the contents of a GYP file by analyzing brace structure, comments, and quoted strings to improve readability.",
  "sources": "Reads input either from a file specified as a command-line argument or from standard input; processes text lines including comments, quoted strings, and braces.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data processing or external actions; output is printed to standard output with indentation adjustments.",
  "flows": "Input reading -> masking comments and quotes -> splitting lines at braces -> counting braces -> adjusting indentation -> printing formatted lines.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code structures are present. The code relies solely on string processing and regex matching. No use of network, file modification, or external system commands. The masking functions are for formatting, not obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script performs line-based processing to pretty-print GYP files by handling comments, quoted strings, and brace structures. It uses regex for comment and quote detection, masking these elements to avoid brace miscounting. It then splits lines with multiple braces and adjusts indentation accordingly. No suspicious functions, data exfiltration, network activity, or code injections are present. The code is straightforward and focused on formatting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a utility for formatting GYP files and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It does not perform any network operations, file modifications beyond reading input, or sensitive data handling. No indicators of malware or security risks are detected.",
