{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to pretty-print the contents of a GYP (Generate Your Projects) file by analyzing and formatting its structure based on brace indentation.",
  "sources": "Reads input from a specified file or standard input; processes text lines to mask comments and quoted strings.",
  "sinks": "Outputs formatted lines to standard output; no untrusted data directly affects system state or data sinks such as network, filesystem, or environment variables.",
  "flows": "Input data is read, processed to mask comments and quotes, split into lines at brace boundaries, then re-indented based on brace count, and finally outputted.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs complex masking of comments and quotes to correctly parse braces; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are evident. No obfuscated code patterns or suspicious behavior like network connections or data exfiltration are present.",
  "analysis": "The script systematically masks comments and quoted strings to accurately count braces, avoiding misinterpretation within strings or comments. It then splits lines with multiple braces for better indentation, maintaining structural clarity. The indentation logic is straightforward, relying solely on brace counts to determine formatting. No external dependencies or network operations are involved. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose of formatting GYP files and does not contain any hidden or malicious functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility script for pretty-printing GYP files. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or malware traits. It functions solely to enhance readability of specific configuration files. No security risks or malicious activities are detected.",
