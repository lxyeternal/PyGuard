{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to pretty-print the contents of a GYP file by formatting its indentation based on brace matching, quotes, and comments.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from a file specified as a command-line argument or from standard input.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs formatted text to standard output; it does not process or transmit data elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Input is read, processed through masking comments and quotes, brace counting, and then pretty-printed with indentation adjustments based on brace flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. The code does perform regex-based text manipulation, but nothing appears malicious or suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script carefully masks comments and quotes to correctly interpret braces for indentation, avoiding accidental modifications inside strings or comments. It performs line-by-line processing, counting braces, adjusting indentation, and printing the formatted output. All operations are limited to text formatting without network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification. There are no suspicious external calls, obfuscated logic, or malicious intent detected. The code's structure is typical for a pretty-printer and does not demonstrate malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears to be a benign utility for code formatting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign pretty-printing utility for GYP files with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It performs safe regex-based text processing to format indentation. No suspicious activities or malicious code patterns are identified.",
