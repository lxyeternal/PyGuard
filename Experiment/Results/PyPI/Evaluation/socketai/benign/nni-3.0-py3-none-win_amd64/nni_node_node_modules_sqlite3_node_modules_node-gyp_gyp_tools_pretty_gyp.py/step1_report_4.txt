{
  "purpose": "The script pretty-prints the contents of a GYP file with proper indentation, handling comments and braces.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from a file specified as a command-line argument or from standard input.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data leads to security effects; the script primarily processes and outputs formatted text.",
  "flows": "Input data -> masking comments and quotes -> brace counting and splitting -> indentation adjustment and output.",
  "anomalies": "Uses regex to mask comments and quotes but does not perform any code execution or system calls; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors found. No obfuscated code features detected. The code is primarily text processing.",
  "analysis": "The script processes text lines from GYP files, masking comments and quoted strings to avoid misinterpreting braces inside them. It counts braces to determine indentation levels and formats the output accordingly. It employs regex-based masking and splitting functions, but there are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or sensitive data handling. It appears to be a benign formatting utility with no malicious intent or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard text processing utility for formatting GYP files. It does not contain malware, malicious behaviors, or security risks. No security concerns are identified.",
