  "purpose": "Generate a Graphviz dependency graph from a JSON dump of target dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'dump.json' file; takes command-line arguments for target filters.",
  "sinks": "Prints Graphviz dot format to stdout; reads JSON data from file.",
  "flows": "Command-line args -> LoadEdges() reads JSON file -> WriteGraph() outputs graph.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no dynamic code execution; standard libraries used.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a fixed file 'dump.json' to load dependency data, filters targets based on command-line input, and outputs a Graphviz-compatible graph. The code uses safe JSON loading and standard library functions without executing untrusted code. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns detected. The file access is straightforward, and no external network or system modification occurs. Overall, the code appears to serve a legitimate purpose with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a legitimate dependency graph generator without malicious intent. It handles input/output securely and does not include malicious or suspicious behavior. No security risks or malware indications are present.",
