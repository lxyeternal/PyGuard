  "purpose": "Generate a Graphviz dependency graph from JSON data exported by dump-dependency-json.",
  "sources": "Reads 'dump.json' file, sys.argv input (targets).",
  "sinks": "Prints to stdout, no critical data sink; no untrusted data passed to external commands or files.",
  "flows": "sys.argv targets -> LoadEdges -> process edges -> WriteGraph -> stdout output.",
  "anomalies": "Uses fixed filename 'dump.json' instead of dynamic input; no input sanitization or validation; no use of environment variables or sensitive data; no obfuscated code or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a static JSON file 'dump.json' and command-line targets. It filters edges to only those relevant targets and their dependencies, then generates a Graphviz representation, grouping nodes by source files. No external or untrusted inputs influence critical code execution besides command-line arguments, which are only used to filter data. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code's primary functions are data processing and formatted printing. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or system harm mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for visualizing dependencies from a JSON dump. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is straightforward, with no suspicious anomalies or malicious intent observed.",
