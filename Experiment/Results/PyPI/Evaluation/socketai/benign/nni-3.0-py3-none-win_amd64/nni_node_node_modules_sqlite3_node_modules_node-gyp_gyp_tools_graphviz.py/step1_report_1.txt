  "purpose": "Generate a Graphviz dependency graph from JSON dump of targets and their dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'dump.json' file, reading command-line arguments",
  "sinks": "Reading 'dump.json', printing Graphviz output to stdout",
  "flows": "Input arguments -> LoadEdges() reads 'dump.json' -> WriteGraph() prints Graphviz code",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution. The code straightforwardly processes JSON and outputs Graphviz syntax.",
  "analysis": "The script loads dependency data from a 'dump.json' file, filters dependencies based on provided targets, and outputs a Graphviz dependency graph. It uses standard Python libraries and performs file I/O, JSON parsing, and printing structured text. No external network calls, no dynamic code execution, no credential handling, or other malicious indicators are present. The file is a typical dependency visualization script with no signs of malicious intent or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate dependency visualization tasks without any malicious or suspicious behavior. There are no security risks, malware, or obfuscation present.",
