  "purpose": "The script aims to set the default system encoding based on the user's locale and print a corresponding label if available.",
  "sources": "The code reads the system's default locale via locale.getdefaultlocale()[1].",
  "sinks": "The code attempts to call sys.setdefaultencoding(encoding), which can affect global string encoding behavior.",
  "flows": "Source: locale.getdefaultlocale() -> sink: sys.setdefaultencoding() (if available) -> output: print of textmap values.",
  "anomalies": "Uses reload(sys) and sys.setdefaultencoding(), which are non-standard in Python 3 and suggest backward compatibility or outdated practices; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code tries to reload sys and set a default encoding based on locale, which is generally discouraged in Python 3, but it does not perform any network I/O, file system modifications, or data exfiltration. The textmap provides labels for specific encodings. No malicious behavior or sabotage detected; the code appears benign and primarily for informational purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is not malicious. It attempts to modify the system's default string encoding based on locale, which is a deprecated practice in Python 3. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The overall security risk is minimal.",
