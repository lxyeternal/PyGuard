  "purpose": "Retrieve system locale encoding, attempt to set it as default encoding, and print a language label based on encoding.",
  "sources": "locale.getdefaultlocale()[1], environment variables, possibly user/system locale settings",
  "sinks": "sys.setdefaultencoding(encoding) (if available), print() output",
  "flows": "locale.getdefaultlocale()[1] -> sys.setdefaultencoding(encoding) -> print()",
  "anomalies": "Use of reload(sys) and sys.setdefaultencoding(), which are deprecated and Python 2-specific; unicode escape sequences in textmap",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to adapt system encoding settings based on locale, handling compatibility for Python 2 and 3. It uses outdated practices (reload and setdefaultencoding) that are unsafe and deprecated but do not perform any malicious actions. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The unicode escapes are harmless. The code's main function is environment setup, with no evident security threats or obfuscation beyond outdated practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily outdated locale handling with no malicious intent. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2) due to deprecated practices that could cause stability issues but not security breaches.",
