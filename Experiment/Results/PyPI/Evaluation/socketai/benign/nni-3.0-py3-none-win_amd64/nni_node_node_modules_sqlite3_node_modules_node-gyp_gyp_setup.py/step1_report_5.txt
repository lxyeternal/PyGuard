  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'gyp-next' Python package, providing metadata and entry points for installation.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description, uses hardcoded package information.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or executes untrusted data; uses standard setup tools.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md -> passes data to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded credentials or secrets, no dynamic execution, no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a standard setup configuration for a Python package, importing only standard modules and setuptools, reading a README file for description, and passing static package metadata to setup(). No input validation or untrusted data handling occurs. The code does not perform network operations, execute arbitrary code, or include any suspicious behavior. It appears to be a straightforward package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a normal setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
