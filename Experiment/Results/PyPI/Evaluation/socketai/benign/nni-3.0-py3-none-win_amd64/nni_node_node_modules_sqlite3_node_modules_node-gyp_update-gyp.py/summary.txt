  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, transparent update script with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The primary security issue is the absence of verification for the downloaded archive, which could be exploited in a supply chain attack. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscated scores are 0. The security risk score should be around 0.3 to reflect the potential for supply chain compromise due to unverified external downloads."
