  "purpose": "Unit tests for the mapbox_earcut triangulation library, verifying correct triangulation outputs and handling of edge cases.",
  "sources": "Static numpy arrays defined within test functions, no external data sources or inputs.",
  "sinks": "Calls to earcut.triangulate_float32, which is part of the tested library; no external system or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Input data (verts, rings) fed into earcut.triangulate_float32; outputs are verified via assertions or exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of unit tests using numpy and pytest, covering multiple data types, edge cases, and invalid inputs. No malicious or suspicious activity is present. The tests do not perform any external operations or data exfiltration. The input data are static and controlled, and the only sink is the triangulation function, which is a standard library call. Error handling is appropriate and expected. The code's structure and purpose are clear and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured test suite with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current scores—malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1—are justified and consistent with the code's nature.",
