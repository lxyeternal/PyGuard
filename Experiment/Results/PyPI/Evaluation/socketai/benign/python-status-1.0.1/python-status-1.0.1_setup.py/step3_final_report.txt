{
  "purpose": "This code is a Python package setup script that reads a README file, optionally converts it with pypandoc, and calls setup() with package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file; imports 'pypandoc' for conversion if available.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external commands or network activity.",
  "flows": "Reads local README file; optional conversion via pypandoc; passes metadata to setup().",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'distutils.core.setup' instead of 'setuptools' (outdated but not malicious); no suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks with no malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. It reads a local file, optionally converts it, and calls setup() with metadata. No obfuscation, no external network activity, and no dynamic code execution are present. The use of 'distutils' is outdated but not security-related. The optional pypandoc import is benign. Overall, the code is straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores of malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, and a very low security risk (~0.1) are appropriate. No further action needed.",
