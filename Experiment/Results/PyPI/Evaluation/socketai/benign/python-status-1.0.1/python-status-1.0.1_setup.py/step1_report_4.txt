  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging the Python module 'status' with metadata and description.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, importing 'pypandoc' for conversion, defining version, and setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly uses untrusted input or data in a way that could lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "N/A — no untrusted data flows from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'distutils.core' instead of 'setuptools' (less common), conditional import of 'pypandoc' for converting README, but no malicious anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles setup configuration for packaging. It conditionally imports 'pypandoc' to convert the README file for long description, with fallback to reading the README directly. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data sources are involved. The code does not execute any external commands, download data, or contain obfuscated or suspicious patterns. It relies on standard packaging practices and contains no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for Python packaging with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
