{
  "purpose": "This script is used for packaging and distributing a Python module called 'python-status' via setup tools.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file to generate long description, potentially reads the file during setup execution.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; the code primarily reads files locally.",
  "flows": "Reads 'README.md' -> uses its content in setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors detected; standard setup script with conditional import.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import 'pypandoc' to convert 'README.md' to reStructuredText for long_description, falling back to reading the file directly if import fails. Uses standard setup() parameters to define package metadata. No code executes remotely, manipulates untrusted input, or performs actions that could be malicious. No obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a normal Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
