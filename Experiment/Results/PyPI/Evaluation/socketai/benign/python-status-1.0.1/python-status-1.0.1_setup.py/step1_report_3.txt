{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'python-status' Python package, configuring package metadata and long description.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, importing 'pypandoc' library, reading package metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data output or external data manipulation.",
  "flows": "N/A; no untrusted data flow or external command execution observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'distutils.core.setup' instead of 'setuptools' (less common but not malicious), conditional import of 'pypandoc' with fallback to reading a file. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script. It attempts to convert 'README.md' to reStructuredText using 'pypandoc' if available; otherwise, reads the file directly. Package metadata is hardcoded and appears benign. No suspicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious code is present. The script does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or code execution beyond importing modules and reading files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It simply prepares package metadata for distribution.",
