  "purpose": "Defines HTTP status code constants and utility functions for categorizing status codes for readability in HTTP-related applications.",
  "sources": "Constants defining various HTTP status codes and functions that check the category of a status code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no data processing or untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "The functions operate on input status codes to determine their category but do not process untrusted input directly.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and consists of definitions and simple functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants for standard HTTP status codes and functions to check if a status code falls within specific ranges. No input handling, no data processing, and no external data sources are involved. The code appears to serve as a utility module for readability and categorization of HTTP status codes. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are identified. The code is simple, static, and adheres to expected standards.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module providing named constants and simple categorization functions for HTTP status codes. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks.",
