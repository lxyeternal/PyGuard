  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the associated scores:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as a static utility module defining constants and simple categorization functions for HTTP status codes.\n- No input handling, data processing, external data sources, or dynamic behaviors are present.\n- No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are identified.\n- The code is straightforward, well-documented, and adheres to standard practices.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  **No.** All reports agree that the code is benign, static, and standard. There are no vulnerabilities, malicious behaviors, or anomalies.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- **Are there any?**  \n  **No.** The code is correct, standard, and does not contain logical errors or suspicious patterns.\n\n### Score Evaluations:\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n  **No change needed.**\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is clear and straightforward.  \n  **No change needed.**\n\n- **Security Risk Score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis. No security risks are evident.  \n  **No change needed.**\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- Since the code is purely a utility module with constants and simple functions, there's no justification for a higher risk, malware, or obfuscated score.\n\n### Consistency and Validity:\n- The scores are consistent across reports and justified by the static, harmless nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**This code is a benign utility module with no security concerns.**\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, straightforward, and free from malicious or suspicious patterns. No modifications to scores are necessary.",
