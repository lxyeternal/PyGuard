  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports describe the code as a straightforward utility module defining HTTP status code constants and simple categorization functions.\n- They consistently note the absence of data sinks, external inputs, dynamic code, or suspicious behaviors.\n- The purpose across reports is to enhance readability and maintainability in web frameworks.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are identified.\n\n**Confirming the Code:**\n- The code matches the description: static definitions of constants and range-check functions.\n- No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or data processing vulnerabilities.\n- The functions are simple, performing numeric range checks, which are safe and standard.\n\n**Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they do not overlook any issues.\n- The reasoning that the code is benign and purely utility-based is sound.\n- No logical flaws or suspicious claims are present.\n\n**Scores and Justification:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - Malware score: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security risk: 0\n- These scores are appropriate given the code's static, read-only nature.\n- The confidence scores are 1, justified by the clarity and simplicity of the code.\n\n**Potential Risks and Malicious Indicators:**\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The code does not process untrusted data, nor does it contain dynamic or network operations.\n- The presence of `from __future__ import unicode_literals` is standard for compatibility and does not introduce risk.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- The code is a benign utility module for HTTP status codes.\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n- No modifications are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe entire set of reports correctly characterizes this code as safe, static, and non-malicious. The scoring aligns well with the analysis, and there are no grounds for concern.",
