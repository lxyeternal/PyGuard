  "purpose": "Defines HTTP status code constants and helper functions for categorizing HTTP response codes.",
  "sources": "Constants for HTTP status codes, functions to check code categories.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code does not process untrusted data or input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; functions are simple checks, constants are static.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, no hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution. No obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code solely provides constants for HTTP status codes and basic category check functions. It imports future unicode_literals for compatibility, which is standard. There are no inputs, outputs, or data processing that could be exploited. The code appears purely informational and utility-based. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. It’s a well-structured, straightforward module for HTTP status codes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, purely informational, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It serves as a utility module for HTTP status codes.",
