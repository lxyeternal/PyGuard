  "purpose": "Defines descriptive HTTP status codes and utility functions for categorizing HTTP response codes.",
  "sources": "Imports future unicode_literals, defines functions and constants for HTTP status code categories and specific codes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or external inputs; constants are fixed integers, functions only perform range checks.",
  "flows": "Functions check numeric ranges; constants are simple integer assignments; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. The code is straightforward and consistent with standard HTTP status code definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for categorizing HTTP status codes and defines constants for each status code. There are no data inputs, outputs, or external interactions. The functions only perform range checks on numeric input, and constants are static integers. No malicious or suspicious patterns, such as dynamic code execution, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms, are present.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign, standard utility for managing HTTP status codes with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and typical for web frameworks.",
