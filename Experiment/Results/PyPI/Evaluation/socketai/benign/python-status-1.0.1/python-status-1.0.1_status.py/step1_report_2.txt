{
  "purpose": "Defines HTTP status code constants and categorization functions for use in a web framework.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources; constants are predefined integers.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present; functions are purely for categorization.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; functions simply evaluate code ranges.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code solely provides constants for HTTP status codes and simple classification functions. It is static and lacks input handling, data processing, or external interactions. The purpose appears to be to facilitate readability and maintainability in a larger web framework. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The code is straightforward, well-documented, and does not perform any operations beyond defining constants and range checks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serves as a utility module for HTTP status codes, and shows no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues.",
