  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is static, straightforward, defining constants and simple functions for categorizing HTTP status codes.\n- No external data sources, no data processing, no input handling, and no network interactions are present.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- The code appears to serve as a utility module for readability and maintainability within a larger web framework context.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward nature of the code.\n- **Security risk scores:** All reports assign 0, indicating no security risks or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n**Confirming the code's integrity:**\n\n- The code is entirely static, with no dynamic or external elements that could be exploited.\n- No signs of backdoors, secret keys, or malicious logic.\n- The functions are simple range checks, which are safe and standard.\n\n**Potential issues or points of concern:**\n\n- The only minor point is the import of `__future__.unicode_literals`, which is harmless and standard for compatibility. It does not introduce any security concern.\n- The constants and functions are purely for categorization and do not process untrusted data directly.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n\n- The reports' assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n- The confidence level of 1 indicates high certainty that the code is benign.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- Based on the provided code and reports, **there is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks**.\n- The code is a benign utility module for HTTP status codes.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks or vulnerabilities)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's characteristics.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, static utility module defining HTTP status codes and categorization functions. No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behaviors are present. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.",
