  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Presence and Functionality**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward utility module defining constants for HTTP status codes and simple categorization functions. There are no signs of dynamic behavior, input handling, or data processing that could be exploited.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior or Backdoors**:  \n   None of the reports detect any malicious code, suspicious patterns, or backdoors. The code is static, well-documented, and adheres to standard practices for defining constants and simple range checks.\n\n3. **Obfuscation and Anomalies**:  \n   The code is not obfuscated, and no anomalies are reported. The use of `from __future__ import unicode_literals` is standard for compatibility and does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:  \n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Security Risk**: All reports assign a security risk of 0, consistent with the analysis.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All are 0, matching the straightforward, clear code.\n\n5. **Potential for False Positives or Assumptions**:  \n   The reports do not rely on assumptions about vulnerabilities; they correctly interpret the code as a benign utility module.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's nature and the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0  \n\nThe code is purely definitional, with no malicious or suspicious behaviors. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe code is a standard, benign utility module defining HTTP status code constants and categorization functions. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are accurate and should remain as-is.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the scores at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk. No changes needed.",
