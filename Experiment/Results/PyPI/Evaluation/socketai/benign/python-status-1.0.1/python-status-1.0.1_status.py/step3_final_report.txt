{
  "purpose": "Defines descriptive HTTP status codes and categorization functions for code readability in web frameworks.",
  "sources": "Constants definitions and simple range-check functions; no external input or data processing.",
  "sinks": "None; code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "N/A; static definitions without data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, well-documented, and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static utility module defining HTTP status code constants and simple categorization functions. It contains no dynamic behavior, input handling, or external data sources. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The functions perform basic range checks, which are safe. The import of 'unicode_literals' is standard for compatibility and does not introduce risk. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static utility module for HTTP status codes with no malicious or security concerns. The current scores are justified and should remain as-is.",
