  "purpose": "Define and categorize HTTP status codes for readability and validation in web frameworks.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; constants and simple functions with hardcoded values.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; purely constant definitions and simple boolean checks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; functions operate on provided numeric codes only.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, providing constants for HTTP status codes and simple utility functions to classify them. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, nor any network operations. The code appears to be a standard utility module for HTTP status management with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is benign, serving as a static reference for HTTP status codes and classification functions. No malicious intent, no security risks identified.",
