  "purpose": "A class providing API calling facilities to the Home Connect API, including request handling and response encapsulation.",
  "sources": "Input data from API responses (response.json()), request parameters (method, endpoint, data), and environment variables or configuration (not explicitly shown).",
  "sinks": "HTTP request execution via self._auth.request(), response handling, and logging outputs.",
  "flows": "Input data is used in API requests, responses are parsed, and errors or data are processed; no untrusted data is forwarded to external systems beyond API calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or unusual code. Extensive commented-out code for SSE streaming is present but not active. No obfuscated code features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for making HTTP requests to an API, with retry logic, logging, and response parsing. It uses asynchronous methods for network communication, handles typical HTTP errors (e.g., 429, 401, 500). No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. No hardcoded secrets or insecure patterns observed. Commented-out SSE streaming code appears standard and non-malicious. The structure and code style suggest a standard API client implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured API client with no indicators of malicious intent or sabotage. No malicious behaviors or security risks identified within this module.",
