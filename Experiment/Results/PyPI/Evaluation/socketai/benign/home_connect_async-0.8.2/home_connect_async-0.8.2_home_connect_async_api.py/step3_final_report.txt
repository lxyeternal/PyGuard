  "purpose": "A class providing API calling facilities to the Home Connect API, including request handling, response parsing, and error management.",
  "sources": "Input data from HTTP responses, response JSON payloads, and request parameters.",
  "sinks": "Response JSON data, error information, and logs (if enabled).",
  "flows": "Request is sent via the auth.request method; response is received, parsed, and encapsulated; errors or retries are handled accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, no suspicious patterns, commented-out SSE code is benign, and no hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard asynchronous API client with retry logic, detailed logging, and response handling. No malicious code, backdoors, or sabotage patterns are detected. Logging could potentially leak sensitive info if logs are insecure, but this is a common concern rather than malicious intent. The commented-out SSE code is benign. The malware score is correctly set to 0, obfuscated to 0, and the security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate given the detailed logs and network interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured API client with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The minor security concern relates to logging practices, which should be managed carefully but do not constitute a security breach.",
