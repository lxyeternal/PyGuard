{
  "purpose": "This code provides a client interface to interact with the Home Connect API, facilitating authenticated HTTP requests and response handling.",
  "sources": "Reads input from API request parameters (method, endpoint, data), and response objects from aiohttp.ClientResponse.",
  "sinks": "Processes API responses, especially JSON data and error information, and logs request/response details.",
  "flows": "Input data (requests) are sent via _auth.request, responses are received, parsed into ApiResponse objects, and logged. The code also handles retries on certain HTTP status codes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Logging detailed request and response info might be sensitive but is typical for debugging. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard HTTP client wrapper for a specific API, with retry logic, error handling, and logging. It does not contain code that exfiltrates data, connects to unknown domains, mines cryptocurrency, or performs malicious system actions. All functions are typical for a secure API client. The commented-out code for SSE streaming is benign and typical for event handling. No anomalies suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard API client implementation with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It securely manages API requests, responses, and errors without any suspicious activity.",
