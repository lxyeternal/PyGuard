  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard setup.py script using setuptools.\n- No dynamic code, input handling, or runtime operations are present.\n- Dependencies are specified with version constraints, reducing some supply chain risks.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are detected.\n- The URL points to a legitimate GitHub repository, typical for open-source projects.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code matches the original code provided. No issues or discrepancies are noted.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None of the reports identify any malicious activity or suspicious patterns.\n- **Dependencies:** They are standard, and no signs of malicious packages are evident.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected; all reports agree on the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Scores assessment:\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Security Risk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|----------------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0.2 (low)      |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0              |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0              |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0              |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0              |\n\n- **Malware score:** All are 0, consistent with benign, static configuration code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security risk score:** Slight variation, with report 1 at 0.2. Given the code's benign nature, this seems reasonable. The others assign 0, which is also justified.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The only point of concern could be the dependencies listed under `install_requires`. If any package were malicious or compromised, that could introduce supply chain risks. However, the listed dependencies (`aiohttp`, `aiohttp-sse-client`, `dataclasses-json`, `oauth2-client`, `charset_normalizer`) are reputable and commonly used.\n- The URL points to a legitimate repository, further reducing suspicion.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified here; the code is purely configuration.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain **0**.\n- **Obfuscated:** Remain **0**.\n- **Risk score:** Given the benign code, a score of **0** is appropriate, with perhaps a slight concern (0.2) if dependencies were untrusted, but here they are standard.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious activity are present.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (or very close to zero, as the code is purely static configuration with standard dependencies)\n\nThis setup script appears safe and free of supply chain security issues based on the provided content.",
