  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources; the code is static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code appears to be standard setup script with typical parameters. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. All dependencies are specified with version constraints. The code is static, lacks input handling, and contains no code execution or external data access. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or unusual logic. The structure and content align with a standard Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. No malicious intent, suspicious code, or security risks are identified. The package appears safe based on the provided content.",
