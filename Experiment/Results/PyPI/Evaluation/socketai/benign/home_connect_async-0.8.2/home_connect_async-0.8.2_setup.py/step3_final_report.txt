{
  "purpose": "This code defines package metadata and dependencies for a Python project using setuptools, serving as a configuration script for package distribution.",
  "sources": "Static code reading the setup() function parameters, including package info, dependencies, and URLs.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or runtime data flows; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration without data flow or runtime execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script with explicit package info, dependencies, and classifiers. No dynamic code, input handling, or external data processing present. Dependencies are reputable packages with version constraints, reducing supply chain risk. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The URL points to a legitimate repository. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to external dependencies, which are common and well-known. The malware score is zero, and obfuscation is absent. The slight variation in security risk scores among reports (0 to 0.2) reflects conservative assessment of dependency trust but is appropriate given the static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static package configuration script with no malicious intent or suspicious patterns. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature. The overall security posture is very low risk, and no further action is necessary.",
