  "purpose": "Manage callback registration and event notifications for appliances and events within a larger system.",
  "sources": "Input data includes callback functions, event keys, and appliance identifiers (haId). Data is read from parameters in methods like register_callback, deregister_callback, and async_broadcast_event.",
  "sinks": "Callbacks executed during event broadcasts can potentially process untrusted data, but the code itself does not directly write or transmit data. The main concern is executing user-provided callback functions, which could be malicious if the callbacks are untrusted.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data (event_key, value, appliance) flows from event triggers through _async_call to callback functions, which are invoked with varying parameters based on their signatures.",
  "anomalies": "The code allows registration of callback functions that could be user-defined. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are visible. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic code execution is present. Callback registration includes wildcard patterns, which could be exploited if callbacks are maliciously designed, but this is a standard pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code provides mechanisms to register, deregister, and broadcast events to callbacks, including support for wildcards and asynchronous callback invocation. It performs input type checks and manages internal callback storage carefully. No signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious network activity are detected. The callback mechanism relies on external functions, which could be malicious if untrusted, but the code itself does not perform harmful operations. No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated logic are present. The use of regex for wildcards is standard and not malicious. Overall, the code appears to be a typical callback management system with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard callback management implementation with no apparent malicious behavior. It handles event subscriptions and broadcasting securely, relying on external callback functions. There are no signs of malware or security risks within this module.",
