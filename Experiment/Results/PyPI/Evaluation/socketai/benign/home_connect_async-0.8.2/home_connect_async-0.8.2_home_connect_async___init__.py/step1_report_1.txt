  "purpose": "Import statements for various modules and classes related to home connectivity and appliance management.",
  "sources": "Import statements referencing local modules: homeconnect, appliance, auth, common, const.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; this code only imports classes and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected. The code consists solely of import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of import statements from local modules within a package, referencing classes and constants such as HomeConnect, Appliance, AuthManager, HealthStatus, etc. There are no functions, data processing, or external data sources involved. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code are present. The structure is standard for a Python package setup or module initialization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely import statements establishing dependencies within the package. It shows no malicious behavior, no hardcoded credentials, no suspicious flows, or anomalies. The risk level is negligible, and the code appears to be safe.",
