  "purpose": "Import statements for local modules related to home automation, appliances, authentication, error handling, logging, and constants.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the current package modules: homeconnect, appliance, auth, common, const.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code contains only import statements with no data flow or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows; only static import declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import statements with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing classes and constants from local modules. There are no functions, data processing, network activity, or external data sources. The code is typical for a module setup in a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The absence of executable logic and external interactions indicates a benign purpose. The minimal risk and malware scores assigned in the reports are appropriate given the code's simplicity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of import statements with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are accurate and consistent with the code's nature. No further action or review is necessary.",
