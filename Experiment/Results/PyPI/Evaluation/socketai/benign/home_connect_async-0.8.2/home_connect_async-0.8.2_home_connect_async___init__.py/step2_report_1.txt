  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, the appropriateness of their scores, and any inconsistencies.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as merely import statements from local modules within a package.\n- No functions, data processing, network activity, or external data sources are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are detected.\n- The code appears to be a standard module setup for a home automation or appliance management system.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Assessment:** No issues, negligible risk, no malware.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Verdict:** Fully aligned with the code's nature. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, no anomalies, straightforward imports, minimal risk.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Verdict:** Slightly above zero for securityRisk, but given the code's simplicity, this is acceptable. The risk score is minimal and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; standard import statements, benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion; purely import statements, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Assessment:** Slightly more cautious, with a confidence score of 0.9, but still concludes safety.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable. The slight uncertainty is reflected in the confidence score, but the risk scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk Scores:** The risk scores are very low (0 or 0.1), consistent with the code's nature. Since the code is only import statements with no executable logic, these scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Clear, straightforward import statements.\n- **Risk Score:** **0** — No security risk in this code snippet.\n\n**Note:** The overall assessment aligns with the code's simplicity. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code provided. The scores are reasonable, and no further action or escalation is warranted based on this fragment.",
