  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as merely import statements from local modules within a package.\n- No executable logic, data processing, network activity, or external inputs are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), and the malware scores are zero across all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the code's content:\n- The original code snippet matches the reports' descriptions: only import statements of classes and constants from local modules.\n- No code, functions, or data flows are present that could be malicious or suspicious.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; no logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n- The conclusion that the code is benign and safe is justified based on the provided snippet.\n\n### Scores and their justification:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct; no obfuscation is present.\n- **Security risk score:** Mostly 0 or very low (0.1), reflecting negligible risk—this aligns with the code's nature.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- The reports suggest a very low risk, which is reasonable.\n- No assumptions are made about external behaviors or vulnerabilities that aren't present.\n- Since the code is only import statements, it cannot contain malicious logic.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent with the code content.\n- No changes needed; the assessments are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert assessment:\nGiven the nature of the code, I concur with the reports' evaluations. The risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at **0**. The code is a standard module import setup with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risk. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate.",
