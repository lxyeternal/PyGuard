  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, the appropriateness of their scores, and whether any adjustments are warranted.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements from local modules within a package.\n- No functions, data processing, external network calls, or executable logic are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious code are evident.\n- The scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, security risk) are all zero or negligible, aligning with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Review:\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly identifies the code as straightforward import statements.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1\n- **Justification:** The security risk score is minimal but not zero. Since the code is only import statements, the risk is negligible, but a very slight potential (e.g., if the imported modules are compromised) could justify a tiny score.\n- **Verdict:** No change needed. The low security risk score is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same as above; correctly states the code is just imports with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1\n- **Justification:** Similar reasoning; the minimal security risk score is appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Accurate; only import statements with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Justification:** Zero security risk aligns with the code's nature.\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correct; only import statements, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Justification:** No reason to assign any security risk.\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Accurate; straightforward import statements, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9\n- **Justification:** Slightly less than perfect confidence, but still very high. The security risk is appropriately zero.\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; scores are zero.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are zero, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in the first two reports, which is reasonable given the code's simplicity and the negligible risk of malicious imports. The others assign zero, which is also appropriate.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk in import statements alone)\n\n**Final conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and their scores are reasonable. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nAll reports correctly assess the code as benign import statements with negligible or no security risk. The scores align well with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.",
