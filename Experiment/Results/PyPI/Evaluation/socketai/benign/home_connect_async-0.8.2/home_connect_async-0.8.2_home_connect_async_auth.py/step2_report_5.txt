  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the logic, and the scoring justification.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes standard OAuth2 token management, HTTP requests, SSE streaming.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows from token responses and user input into headers and requests.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code. Usage of webbrowser for login is typical.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious behavior, risk is low (0.2), malware score is 0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies the code as standard OAuth2 handling with no malicious activity. The low security risk and malware scores are justified. The logic is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar OAuth2 flow, token management.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No secrets or obfuscation. The code is straightforward.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No signs of malicious behavior, malware score 0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAccurate. The code is standard, and the report's reasoning is consistent. The risk and malware scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same OAuth2 implementation, with user login via webbrowser.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The only concern is the use of `webbrowser.open()`, which could be manipulated if the URL is compromised. However, in this context, it's standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious intent detected; the webbrowser usage is typical for OAuth flows.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe potential concern about webbrowser.open() is acknowledged but not considered malicious here. The scores remain appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar OAuth2 token handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No secrets or obfuscation. Use of webbrowser is normal.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious activity, scores justified.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with the previous reports; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard OAuth2 with token renewal.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Same as above; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No signs of malicious activity, scores appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAll reports consistently find no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** None of the reports identify actual issues in the code. The code performs standard OAuth2 token management, request handling, and SSE streaming.\n- **Errors or Flaws:** No logical errors, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.\n- **Scores Justification:**  \n  - **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.  \n  - **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with the straightforward code.  \n  - **Security Risk:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risk due to webbrowser invocation, which is typical for OAuth flows but could be exploited if URLs are compromised externally. This is a reasonable assessment.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — minor risk due to webbrowser use, but overall standard OAuth implementation.\n\n**In conclusion, the code appears secure, well-structured, and free of malicious intent. The provided scores are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.**",
