  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard OAuth2 client implementation with proper token management and request handling. No malicious activity, sabotage, or supply chain risks are evident. The only minor concern is the use of webbrowser.open(), which is typical but should be used cautiously. Overall, the security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscated scores are zero."
