{
  "purpose": "The code implements an OAuth 2 authentication flow, manages tokens, and performs authenticated HTTP requests and SSE streams for a home automation SDK.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include configuration parameters (client ID, secret, scopes), redirect URLs, and token responses from OAuth servers.",
  "targets": "Untrusted data can influence HTTP headers (e.g., 'Authorization', 'Accept-Language'), URL endpoints, or trigger web browser actions.",
  "flows": "From OAuth token responses and user input (via webbrowser), tokens are stored and used to authenticate requests; data flows from user input and OAuth server responses through token management into authenticated API calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials present; no suspicious URL or domain activity detected; code uses standard libraries and OAuth flows. No unusual code constructs or obfuscation identified.",
  "analysis": "The code follows standard OAuth 2 flows, including token renewal and web-based authorization. It manages tokens with expiration timestamps and opens the user's web browser for login. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or hidden backdoors. The web requests include proper authorization headers. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present; the only potential concern would be if this code was intentionally misused with malicious intent, but nothing in the code indicates such behavior. The token management and web request handling appear standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical OAuth 2 authentication implementation with token management for a home automation SDK. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be well-structured and uses standard libraries appropriately.",
