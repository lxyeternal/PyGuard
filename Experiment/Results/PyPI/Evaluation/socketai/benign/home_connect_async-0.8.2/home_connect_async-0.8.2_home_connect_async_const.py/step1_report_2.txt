  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; code only defines constants and an enum.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; code is static definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated content detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of static constant definitions for API URLs and a string enumeration for event types. No input reading, data processing, or external interactions are present. The constants are straightforward and appear to serve configuration purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code. The enum class simply defines event type strings without any dynamic or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple configuration module defining constants and an enum for event types, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
