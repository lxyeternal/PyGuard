  "purpose": "Define constants and an enumeration for event types related to Home Connect API interactions",
  "sources": "Constants for host URLs and OAuth endpoints, Enum class for event types",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data is being processed or output from untrusted sources",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static definitions only",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code consists of static string definitions and an enum class",
  "analysis": "The code defines URL constants and an enum class for event types. All data is hardcoded and static, with no user input, network communication, or dynamic code execution. No secrets, credentials, or sensitive data are embedded. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors are present. The structure and content are typical for configuration or API interaction code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be configuration and enumeration definitions intended for use in a larger application. No malicious intent or security risks are identified.",
