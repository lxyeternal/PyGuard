  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Presence & Content:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code consists solely of static string constants for URLs, OAuth scopes, and an Enum class for event types.\n   - No dynamic code, user input handling, network operations, or data processing is present.\n   - The code appears to be configuration or constants definitions for a larger system.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior & Anomalies:**\n   - No report indicates any hardcoded credentials, suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious payloads.\n   - The code is straightforward and typical for such configuration modules.\n\n3. **Scores & Justification:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0\n     - Confidence: 1\n   - These scores are consistent with the analysis; the code is static, non-malicious, and contains no suspicious activity.\n\n4. **Potential Risks & Assumptions:**\n   - The code does not process untrusted data nor perform any external communication beyond defining constants.\n   - No evidence suggests any vulnerability or malicious intent.\n   - The use of hardcoded URLs and event strings is typical for configuration code and does not pose a security risk by itself.\n\n5. **Overall Evaluation:**\n   - The code is a standard configuration snippet for API endpoints and event types.\n   - No issues related to malware, obfuscation, or security risk are evident.\n   - The high confidence scores are justified given the static nature and lack of suspicious activity.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct; no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct; code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct; no security issues identified)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- If I were to suggest any adjustments, they would be to maintain the current scores, as they accurately reflect the code's nature.\n- The reports are consistent and comprehensive.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign, static configuration module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
