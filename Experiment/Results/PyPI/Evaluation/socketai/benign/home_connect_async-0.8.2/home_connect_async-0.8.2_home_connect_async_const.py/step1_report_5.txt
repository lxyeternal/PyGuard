{
  "purpose": "Define constants and an enumeration for event types related to a Home Connect API interaction",
  "sources": "Hardcoded strings for URLs, endpoint paths, and default scopes; enumeration values",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flow or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code mainly declares constants and an enum",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code sets up constants for API URLs and scopes, and defines an enumeration for event types. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no dynamic code execution, and no data processing or transmission. The URLs and event names are hardcoded, which is standard for such configuration modules. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward configuration and enumeration definitions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate part of an API client setup.",
