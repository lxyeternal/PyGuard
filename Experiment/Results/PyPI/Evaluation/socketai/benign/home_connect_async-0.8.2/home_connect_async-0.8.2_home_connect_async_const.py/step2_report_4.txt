  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code consists solely of static string constants for URLs, OAuth endpoints, scopes, and an Enum class for event types.\n   - No user input, network operations, dynamic code execution, or data processing is present.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or sensitive data are observed.\n   - The code appears to serve as configuration or constants for a larger application.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning:**\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues. This aligns with the static, configuration-like nature of the code.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident; the assessments are consistent and justified based on the code content.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0\n     - Confidence: 1\n   - These scores are appropriate given the static nature of the code and lack of suspicious activity.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports assign a security risk of 0, and the code shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities, raising the risk score would be unjustified.\n   - The malware score of 0 correctly reflects the absence of malicious activity.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions—no network calls, no dynamic code, no embedded secrets.\n   - The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports are cautious and do not assume malicious intent where none exists.\n   - They correctly identify the code as static configuration data.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's content.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a straightforward static configuration module defining constants and an enumeration for event types related to a home-connect system. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\nMaintain the current scores:\n- malware: 0\n- obfuscated: 0\n- securityRisk: 0\n\nand note that the code is benign and typical for configuration purposes.",
