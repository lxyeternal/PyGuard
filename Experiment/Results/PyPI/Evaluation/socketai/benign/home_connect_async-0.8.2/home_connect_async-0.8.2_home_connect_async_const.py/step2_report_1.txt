  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their assessments with the actual code, and then synthesize an overall security posture.\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:\n   - The code consists solely of static string constants defining API host URLs, OAuth endpoints, default scopes, and an enumeration (`Events`) for event types.\n   - There are no user inputs, network calls, dynamic code execution, or embedded secrets.\n   - The code is purely configuration-like, intended for use elsewhere in an application.\n\n2. **Logical and Reasoning Flaws**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is static configuration data with no malicious behavior.\n   - No report suggests any misinterpretation or flawed reasoning about the code's purpose.\n   - The consistent conclusion across reports is that there are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n3. **Score Evaluations**:\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward, human-readable code.\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, aligning with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - **Security Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, which is reasonable because the code does not introduce any security vulnerabilities by itself.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:\n   - None of the reports suggest any potential vulnerabilities or malicious intent that would warrant a higher score.\n   - The code is purely static configuration data, with no dynamic or sensitive elements.\n\n5. **Potential Issues or Assumptions**:\n   - The reports assume that static constants and enums are inherently safe, which is valid here.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made, and no claims of malicious activity are present.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with Content**:\n   - All scores are consistent with the code content and the analysis provided.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n**Final Summary**:\n- The code is a straightforward set of configuration constants and an enum for event types.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security risk factors are present.\n- The scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate.\n\n**My Personal Estimate**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (clear, human-readable code)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security issues identified)\n\nThis assessment aligns with the consensus in the reports and the actual code content.",
