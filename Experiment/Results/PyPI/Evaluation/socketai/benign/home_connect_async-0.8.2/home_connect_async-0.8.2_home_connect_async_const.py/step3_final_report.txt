  "purpose": "Defines API host URLs, OAuth endpoints, default scopes, and an enumeration for event types used in a home-connect system.",
  "sources": "Static string constants for URLs, OAuth endpoints, and scope list; Enum class for event types.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static configuration data with no data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static configuration with human-readable constants and enum.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string constants and an Enum class, serving as configuration data. There are no inputs, network calls, dynamic code execution, or embedded secrets. The code is clear, human-readable, and typical for configuration purposes. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the content and nature of the code. The high confidence in benignity is justified given the static, non-malicious nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code content. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
