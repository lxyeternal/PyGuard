  "purpose": "Defines constants for API endpoints and OAuth scopes, and an enumeration for event types related to a home-connect system.",
  "sources": "Constant string variables for host URLs and OAuth endpoints, and an enum class for event type strings.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; no external data handling or processing present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code is static and configuration-like.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only static string constants and an Enum class, with no user input, network operations, or data processing. The variables define API URLs and OAuth scopes, which are typical configuration data. The enum specifies event names used for internal logic or event handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard configuration and enumeration definitions without any malicious intent or security issues.",
