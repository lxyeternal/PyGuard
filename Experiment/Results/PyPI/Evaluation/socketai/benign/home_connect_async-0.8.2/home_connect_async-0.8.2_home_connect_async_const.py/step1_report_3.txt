  "purpose": "Define constants and enumerations for API endpoints, OAuth scopes, and event types related to home-connect system integration.",
  "sources": "String assignments for API host URLs, OAuth endpoints, and scope list; Enum class for event type strings.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; straightforward static configuration data with standard Enum usage.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only static constant definitions and a simple Enum class for event types. All strings are hardcoded, representing URLs, OAuth scopes, and event identifiers. No input reading, no data processing, no external communications, or dynamic code execution are present. The code appears to serve as configuration or constant definitions for a larger application.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities. It functions solely as a static configuration module. No security risks are present based on this code fragment.",
