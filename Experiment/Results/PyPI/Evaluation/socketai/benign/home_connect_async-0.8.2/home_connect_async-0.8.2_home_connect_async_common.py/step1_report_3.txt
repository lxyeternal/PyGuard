{
  "purpose": "Provide shared utility classes, error handling, and synchronization mechanisms for the SDK",
  "sources": "No external data sources; only class definitions and internal methods",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; logging is conditional but controlled via class flags",
  "flows": "N/A; no external data flow or network communication",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility classes for conditional logging, error handling, synchronization, and status management. The logging mechanism is controlled via enum flags and only logs based on set flags. The custom exception class encapsulates response data but does not contain malicious code. Synchronization uses asyncio.Lock, which is standard. The status management uses enum flags and date/time calculations for blocked periods. No data leaks, code injections, or malicious behaviors are detected. No external or untrusted data sources or sinks are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility code for managing logs, errors, and status states in an SDK. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. It is likely safe based on the provided fragment.",
