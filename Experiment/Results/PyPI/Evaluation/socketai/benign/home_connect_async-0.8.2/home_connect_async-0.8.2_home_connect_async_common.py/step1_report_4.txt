{
  "purpose": "Provide shared utility classes and exception handling for a larger SDK or application related to Home Connect integrations.",
  "sources": "None; all code defines classes, constants, and methods without external input reading or data processing.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network, file, or environment variable usage are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code mainly defines utility classes and exception handling without data processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or behavior observed. The code employs standard Python features, no obfuscated or misleading constructs. No hardcoded credentials or secret data are present.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises utility classes for conditional logging, custom exception handling, synchronization primitives, and status management. It includes methods for setting and checking log modes, managing connection health statuses, and handling exceptions with relevant context. The use of asyncio.Lock indicates asynchronous operation coordination. No network communication, credential handling, or data leakage mechanisms are present. All components serve standard, benign purposes within an SDK context.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign set of utility classes and exception handling for an SDK. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected. The code does not include any suspicious or harmful operations.",
