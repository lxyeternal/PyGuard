  "purpose": "Utility classes for logging, error handling, synchronization, and status management in a Python SDK.",
  "sources": "Class methods accessing internal variables, exception constructors, datetime and timedelta calculations, enum flags, and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No external data sources, network calls, or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Internal method calls manipulating class attributes and internal state; no external input flows or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; code is straightforward, with standard patterns and no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises utility classes with no external input processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The logging flags are internal, exception class is standard, and status management uses enum flags and datetime calculations. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code is well-structured, readable, and follows best practices. No anomalies or malicious patterns are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The current scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
