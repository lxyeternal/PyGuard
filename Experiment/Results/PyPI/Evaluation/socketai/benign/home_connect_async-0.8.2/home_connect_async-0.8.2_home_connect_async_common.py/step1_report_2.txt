{
  "purpose": "Provides utility classes and functions for logging, error handling, synchronization, and connection health status management in a larger SDK or application.",
  "sources": "No explicit data sources; mostly class attributes and method parameters used for internal state management.",
  "sinks": "No evident data sinks; no untrusted data is written out or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No external data flow or untrusted input flow identified; methods primarily modify or retrieve internal state.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no obfuscated or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic detected. Exception handling is straightforward. No network activity or external communication observed.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises utility classes for logging, custom error handling, synchronization with asyncio, and status management with clear, standard implementations. The logging uses flags, error class captures response details, synchronization uses asyncio.Lock, and health status management employs enum flags. No signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility code with no malicious intent or security risks. It effectively manages internal application states and logging conditions without exposing sensitive data or enabling harmful actions.",
