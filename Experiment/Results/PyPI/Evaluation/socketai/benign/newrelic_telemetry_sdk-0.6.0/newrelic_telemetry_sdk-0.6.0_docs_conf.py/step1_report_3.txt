  "purpose": "Configuration setup for generating Sphinx documentation for the 'newrelic-telemetry-sdk' Python package.",
  "sources": "Import of the 'newrelic_telemetry_sdk' module to access its version information.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present in the code.",
  "flows": "The imported module's version information is read and used to set project version variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is standard for a Sphinx configuration file.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Sphinx documentation configuration file. It imports a single external module solely to access its version attribute, which is standard practice. No user input, data handling, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are present. There are no hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or backdoors. All dependencies are standard for documentation generation, and the import of 'newrelic_telemetry_sdk' appears solely for version information. No obfuscation or malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Sphinx documentation configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only reads version info from an external module for documentation purposes. Overall, the script is safe.",
