  "purpose": "This code is a configuration file for Sphinx documentation, primarily setting up project info, extensions, and HTML output options. It imports 'newrelic_telemetry_sdk' solely to retrieve version information.",
  "sources": "The import of 'newrelic_telemetry_sdk' used to access its '__version__' attribute.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data inputs or outputs; no data leaks or external effects are present.",
  "flows": "The code reads the SDK's version attribute to set version variables; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "The import of 'newrelic_telemetry_sdk' appears solely for version info retrieval, which is standard practice; no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, straightforward Sphinx configuration script. It imports a third-party SDK only to access version info, which is common and benign. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling occurs. The import is used solely for metadata purposes. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Sphinx configuration file that imports a third-party SDK solely for version retrieval. There is no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risk present. The scores and assessments in the reports are accurate and justified.",
