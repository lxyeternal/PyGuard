  "purpose": "Configuration setup for Sphinx documentation builder for the 'newrelic-telemetry-sdk' project.",
  "sources": "Import of the 'newrelic_telemetry_sdk' module.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data outputs or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "The code imports a module to obtain version info, which is then used to set project version variables.",
  "anomalies": "The code imports a third-party SDK module ('newrelic_telemetry_sdk') solely for accessing its version information. There is no evidence of code execution, data processing, or network activity. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file, importing a well-known telemetry SDK only to retrieve its version number. All code pertains to documentation setup with no user input, network calls, or executable payloads. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or security risks are present. The import appears purely for obtaining version info, which is a typical practice in project configuration files.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign configuration script for Sphinx documentation with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It solely references a third-party SDK for versioning purposes. The code is straightforward and standard, with no anomalies or malicious indicators.",
