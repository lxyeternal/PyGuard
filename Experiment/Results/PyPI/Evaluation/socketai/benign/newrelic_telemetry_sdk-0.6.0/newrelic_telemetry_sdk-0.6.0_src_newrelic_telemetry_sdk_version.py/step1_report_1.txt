  "purpose": "This code defines a version string for a Python package, generated automatically by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "The version variable assignment, which is likely used for package versioning.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing occurring; no untrusted data handling or external data sources.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; the comment indicates automated generation and suggests no manual modification, but no anomalies are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple static assignment of a version string, generated by setuptools_scm. It contains no dynamic execution, external inputs, or suspicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials, data leaks, or malicious code are present. The comments specify it is auto-generated and should not be altered, typical for version management in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "This is benign, auto-generated package version metadata with no malicious intent or security risks.",
