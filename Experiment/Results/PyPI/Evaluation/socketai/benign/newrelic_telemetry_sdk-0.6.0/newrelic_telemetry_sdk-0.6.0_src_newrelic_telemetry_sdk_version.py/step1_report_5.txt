  "purpose": "Metadata declaration for package versioning, generated by setuptools_scm",
  "sources": "Constant string assignment for version number",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks present",
  "flows": "N/A, only a static assignment",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any code execution, input handling, or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward assignment of a version string, generated by setuptools_scm. It explicitly states not to modify or track in version control, indicating it is auto-generated metadata. No input, output, or sensitive operations are present. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are detectable. The file's purpose is purely informational and configuration-related.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It is a simple, auto-generated version declaration typical for Python package management.",
