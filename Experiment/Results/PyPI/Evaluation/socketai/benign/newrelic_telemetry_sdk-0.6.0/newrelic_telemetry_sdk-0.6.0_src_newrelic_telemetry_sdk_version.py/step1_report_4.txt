  "purpose": "This code defines the version of a Python package using setuptools_scm, a common version management tool.",
  "sources": "Reads the version string assignment from the code itself.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as the code simply assigns a version string.",
  "anomalies": "The comment indicates the file is generated and should not be manually changed or tracked, but this is standard for version files.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a version assignment and comments about its generation. There are no input/output operations, no data processing, and no suspicious or unusual code patterns. The use of setuptools_scm is typical for version management. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code appears benign and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign version declaration generated by a version management tool. No malicious intent or security risks are detected.",
