  "purpose": "This code snippet appears to define the version information for a Python package generated by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "The assignment of the version string to the variable 'version'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform security-sensitive actions.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from input to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "The comment indicates auto-generation and discourages modification, which is standard for versioning files. No suspicious or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a static version string to a variable, which is typical in package versioning. There are no functions, input handling, network operations, or other behavior that could be malicious. The comments indicate the file is auto-generated by setuptools_scm, a common version control tool. No indicators of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, auto-generated version declaration file with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
