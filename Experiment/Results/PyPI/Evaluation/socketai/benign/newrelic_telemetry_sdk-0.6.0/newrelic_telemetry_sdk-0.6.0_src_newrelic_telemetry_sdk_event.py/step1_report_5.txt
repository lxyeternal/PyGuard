  "purpose": "Define an Event class for representing events in New Relic Insights, including timestamp and tags.",
  "sources": "Input parameters event_type, tags, timestamp_ms in __init__ method",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed into external systems or outputs",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> class attributes (update and super constructor) -> property accessors",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python class for managing event data. It accepts input parameters for event type, optional tags, and optional timestamp. The timestamp defaults to current time if not provided. The class updates its dictionary with tags if provided and initializes with event type and timestamp. There are no external calls, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, well-structured class for event representation. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
