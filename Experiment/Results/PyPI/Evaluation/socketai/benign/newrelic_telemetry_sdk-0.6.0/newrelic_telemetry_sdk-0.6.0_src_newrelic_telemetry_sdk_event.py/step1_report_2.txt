  "purpose": "Define an Event class for representing and handling events in New Relic Insights.",
  "sources": "Reading input parameters event_type, tags, timestamp_ms; reading system time via time.time()",
  "sinks": "Update method writes to the dictionary object; no external sinks involved",
  "flows": "Constructor reads inputs and system time; updates dictionary; properties access dictionary entries",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated code present. No external data or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for event representation, initializing with provided parameters or current time, updating internal dictionary. No external data sources, no sinks that send data externally, and no flow leading to data leakage or malicious activity. The class structure is straightforward and standard. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code. It simply manages event data internally.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign class for event management, with no malicious or security-compromising elements detected. It is a standard implementation with no suspicious behavior.",
