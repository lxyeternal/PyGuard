{
  "purpose": "Define an Event class for creating and managing event data for New Relic Insights.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters (event_type, tags, timestamp_ms), time.time() function",
  "sinks": "None present; no data being sent or output externally",
  "flows": "Constructor reads input parameters and system time, updates internal dictionary, properties access stored data",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code performs standard data handling and object initialization without suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple subclass of dict to represent events with optional tags and timestamp. The timestamp is generated using the system clock, and tags are added to the dictionary if provided. There are no external data sources, file reads, network calls, or untrusted inputs other than constructor parameters, which are typical for such classes. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious behavior is evident. The code is straightforward and adheres to expected behavior for a data model class.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data container class with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply manages event data for reporting purposes without external threats.",
