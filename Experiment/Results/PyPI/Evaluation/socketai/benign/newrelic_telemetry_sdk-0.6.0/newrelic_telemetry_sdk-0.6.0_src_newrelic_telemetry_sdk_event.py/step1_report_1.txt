  "purpose": "Define a class for representing and handling events in New Relic Insights with optional tagging and timestamp features.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in __init__ method: event_type, tags, timestamp_ms",
  "sinks": "None present; no data is written to external systems or files",
  "flows": "Initialization flows from __init__ parameters to object properties, no external data flows involved",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no dynamic code execution or malicious indicators",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Event class inheriting from dict to model event data for New Relic. It uses standard library time for timestamps. The constructor updates the object with optional tags and sets event type and timestamp. The copy method creates a duplicate instance. Properties access the dict keys safely. The code appears clean, straightforward, and standard for such data modeling purposes. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard data model class with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain backdoors, data leaks, or obfuscated malicious code. It is a benign utility class.",
