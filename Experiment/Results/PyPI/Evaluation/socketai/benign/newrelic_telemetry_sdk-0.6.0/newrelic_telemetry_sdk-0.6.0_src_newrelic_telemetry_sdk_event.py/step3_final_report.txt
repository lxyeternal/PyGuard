  "purpose": "A simple data container class for reporting events to New Relic Insights, encapsulating event type, tags, and timestamp.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters: event_type, tags, timestamp_ms",
  "sinks": "None; in-memory data structure only",
  "flows": "Initialization assigns eventType and timestamp; optional tags update the dictionary",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of dict, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from dict, initializing with event_type, optional tags, and timestamp. It uses standard library functions and safe dictionary updates. No external data flows, network activity, or code execution are present. The class provides properties for accessing event_type and timestamp, and a copy method for duplication. The implementation is clear, simple, and free of malicious or suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward data model for event reporting with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
