{
  "purpose": "This code provides imports and setup for the New Relic Telemetry SDK, used for monitoring and logging application metrics, events, and traces.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the newrelic_telemetry_sdk package, including version info retrieval.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data transmission points are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "N/A — primarily import and export definitions, with no runtime data flow or untrusted data handling shown.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The version import uses a try-except block to set a default value if import fails, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various classes and functions related to telemetry data collection and handling from the newrelic_telemetry_sdk. It attempts to import the version string, defaulting to 'unknown' if unsuccessful. It defines an __all__ list for module exports. There is no user input, data processing, or network activity; it is solely module setup and configuration. The code appears clean, standard, and non-malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup for a telemetry SDK module, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It contains no obfuscated code, backdoors, or suspicious patterns.",
