  "purpose": "Module setup for the newrelic telemetry SDK, importing components and defining exports.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the SDK modules, including version info with fallback.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted sources; only import/export setup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard SDK module initialization with safe version import handling. It only imports classes and functions, then defines __all__ for exports. No data processing, network activity, or malicious constructs are present. The try-except for version info is a common pattern, not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module setup for the SDK. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are appropriate.",
