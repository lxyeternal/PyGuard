{
  "purpose": "To import and expose classes, functions, and constants from the 'newrelic_telemetry_sdk' package for external use, facilitating telemetry data handling and reporting.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the 'newrelic_telemetry_sdk' package modules, including 'batch', 'client', 'event', 'harvester', 'log', 'metric', 'span', and version info.",
  "sinks": "Exports listed in '__all__' for external access; no untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks, as this code only imports and exposes components.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is primarily structural and configurational.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various classes and functions from the 'newrelic_telemetry_sdk' package, handling telemetry data such as events, spans, metrics, logs, and harvester components. It includes a conditional import for versioning, with fallback to 'unknown'. No data processing, input/output handling, or untrusted data flows are present. The structure indicates it is a module designed for API exposure rather than runtime logic or data handling. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initialization module that imports and exports components for telemetry data handling. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. It is safe and serves as a public API surface for the 'newrelic_telemetry_sdk' package.",
