  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks within this code segment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected. The version import with fallback is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly consists of import statements and an __all__ declaration for module exports. It includes a try-except block for version import, which is common for maintaining compatibility. No external data input handling, no network operations, or suspicious behavior present.",
