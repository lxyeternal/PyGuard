{
  "purpose": "Defines classes for telemetry metrics (Gauge, Count, Summary) with timestamping and attribute handling, intended for monitoring systems like New Relic.",
  "sources": "Parameters passed to class constructors (name, value, interval_ms, tags, end_time_ms), system time via time.time()",
  "sinks": "Internal data structures (dictionaries) storing metric data; no external data transfer or network activity",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> class constructors -> internal dictionary attributes -> timestamp calculations based on system time",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard class definitions for telemetry metrics, with properties and timestamp calculations. It uses common Python patterns, relies solely on input parameters and system time, and does not perform external communication or data exfiltration. No security flaws, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The code appears to be a benign SDK component for metrics collection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign implementation of telemetry metric classes with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk (~0.1) are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
