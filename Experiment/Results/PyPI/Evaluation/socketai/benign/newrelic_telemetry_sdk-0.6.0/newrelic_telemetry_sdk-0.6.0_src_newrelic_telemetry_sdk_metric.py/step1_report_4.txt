{
  "purpose": "Define various metric classes (Gauge, Count, Summary) for telemetry data collection and reporting.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'time' module; class constructors receiving parameters for metric attributes; usage of object defaults and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; code primarily creates and manages in-memory data structures without external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into class constructors; data is stored within class instances as dictionaries; properties retrieve stored values.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious data handling detected. The code mainly manages telemetry metric data structures.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of classes for telemetry metrics (Gauge, Count, Summary) inheriting from a base 'Metric' class. It includes initialization, property accessors, and copying methods. No external data transmission, no dynamic code execution, and no insecure operations are present. The only input data are constructor parameters, which are safely stored in internal dictionaries. No malicious behavior, suspicious data flows, or anomalies are identified. The code appears to be standard implementation for telemetry data management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of telemetry metric classes with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It functions solely to structure metric data for reporting purposes, with no external or secret data handling involved.",
