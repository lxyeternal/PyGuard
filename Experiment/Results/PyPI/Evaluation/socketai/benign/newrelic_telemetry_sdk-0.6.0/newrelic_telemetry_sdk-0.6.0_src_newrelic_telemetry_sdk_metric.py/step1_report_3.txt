{
  "purpose": "Defines a set of classes for creating and managing various metric types (Gauge, Count, Summary) for telemetry data collection.",
  "sources": "Imports the 'time' module; reads input parameters during class instantiation such as 'name', 'value', 'tags', 'interval_ms', 'end_time_ms'.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'time.time()' to generate timestamps; no untrusted data sinks like network or file operations present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (name, value, tags, timing info) flow into class constructors; timestamp calculations depend on 'time.time()'; no external or untrusted data flows out.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation; code appears to be standard data structure classes for metrics.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of metric data classes with no evidence of malicious intent. It utilizes standard Python practices, relies on the 'time' module for timestamps, and manages data in dictionaries. No network or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. No obfuscated or suspicious logic detected. The code appears to be a legitimate part of a telemetry SDK for metrics collection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of telemetry metric classes with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely as data containers with timestamp calculations based on system time, without any malicious side effects.",
