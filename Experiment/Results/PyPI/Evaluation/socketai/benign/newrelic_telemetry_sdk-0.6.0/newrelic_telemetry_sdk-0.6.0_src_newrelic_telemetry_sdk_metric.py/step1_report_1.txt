{
  "purpose": "Defines classes for creating and managing different types of telemetry metrics (Gauge, Count, Summary) with associated attributes and timestamps, likely for monitoring or analytics purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function parameters, environment variables (via time), and optional tags provided during instantiation.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that send data over networks, write to files, or leak information. No external connections or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from object instantiation (parameters like name, value, tags, end_time_ms) through class methods and properties, with internal calculations for timestamps and attributes but no external data flow or manipulation outside the class context.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors. The code adheres to standard metrics class definitions without risky constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code provides metric class definitions for telemetry data. It uses standard Python constructs, properties, and simple timestamp calculations. It does not contain network calls, external data manipulation, or any suspicious behavior. The only notable aspect is the reliance on system time for timestamps, which is typical for such metrics. No anomalies, suspicious imports, or obfuscated features are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation for telemetry metric objects used in monitoring systems. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe based on the provided content.",
