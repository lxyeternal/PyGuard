  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for the 'newrelic-telemetry-sdk' Python package, utilizing setuptools and setuptools_scm for version management.",
  "sources": "Static code defining package name, version control via 'use_scm_version', and dependencies ('urllib3'). No dynamic input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs, network operations, or runtime data sinks present.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration; no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and follows standard packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious patterns. It employs 'use_scm_version' to generate version info during build, which is a common practice. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. All reports correctly identify the code as safe and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are justified and should remain as-is.",
