  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the 'newrelic-telemetry-sdk' Python package, including version management and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it sources data from package setup parameters and the environment during installation.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "The setup configuration flows from package metadata to installation requirements, with version info written to a file.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior detected. Use of setuptools and version control is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script using setuptools for packaging. It defines package name, version control via scm, and dependencies. No untrusted input processing, no dynamic code execution, and no malicious patterns are present. The version information is written to a file during setup, which is common practice. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign setup configuration for a Python package. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
