  "purpose": "The code provides logging utilities for converting Python log records into JSON-formatted logs suitable for submission to New Relic's logging API.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from logging.LogRecord objects when creating Log instances or extracting record data.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to external systems, but the JSON serialization of logs could be misused if logs are collected maliciously. No external sinks or data leaks are explicitly present.",
  "flows": "LogRecord creation or extraction flows into JSON serialization for logs via the format method in NewRelicLogFormatter, and Log.from_record converts LogRecord into Log objects.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code appears standard for logging purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for representing logs (Log) and formatting logs as JSON for New Relic. It extracts detailed information from LogRecord objects, including exception info if present, and serializes data into JSON strings. There are no network calls, no dynamic code execution, or other suspicious behaviors. The code is structured, uses standard libraries, and serves a straightforward logging purpose without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging utility that formats logs into JSON for external consumption. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code does not contain obfuscation or malicious data exfiltration mechanisms.",
