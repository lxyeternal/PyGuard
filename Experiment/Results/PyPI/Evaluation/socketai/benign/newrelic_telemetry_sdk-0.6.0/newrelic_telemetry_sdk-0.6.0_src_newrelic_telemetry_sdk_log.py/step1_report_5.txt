  "purpose": "Define custom logging classes and formatter for integrating logs with New Relic's logging API, enabling JSON serialization of log records with optional attributes and error details.",
  "sources": "Reading log records via logging.makeLogRecord(), extracting record data through static methods, accessing record attributes, reading exception info, and accessing record's __dict__.",
  "sinks": "Formatting log records into JSON strings for transmission, no direct data leaks or external data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Log record creation -> extraction of record data -> conversion to JSON string via formatter; no external data flow or network connections present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious functions, or malicious code behavior detected. Use of standard logging modules and safe exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily implements custom log and formatter classes for structured logging to external services like New Relic. It extracts detailed information from log records, including error stack traces, and serializes them into JSON. No external data transmission, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior is present. The exception handling is standard and used solely for error info collection. The code structure is typical for logging utilities and does not perform any malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code provides a legitimate logging utility for structured JSON logs compatible with New Relic. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The implementation is standard, with no signs of sabotage or malicious code.",
