  "purpose": "Provides structured logging classes and formatter for converting log records into JSON format compatible with New Relic, including exception info and extra attributes.",
  "sources": "log record attributes such as created, message, levelname, name, thread, process, pathname, lineno, and exception info.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write to external systems or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "LogRecord attributes are extracted and assembled into a dictionary, then serialized into JSON string.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of structured logging utilities, extracting log data and exception info safely, and serializing into JSON for external systems. It uses common Python modules and practices, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or malicious patterns. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk (~0.1). The code's purpose is solely for logging, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured logging utility intended for external log ingestion. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The low risk score is appropriate, primarily reflecting potential sensitivity of log data, not a security flaw.",
