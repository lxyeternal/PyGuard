  "purpose": "Implementation of SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication protocol for RethinkDB clients, including nonce generation, password hashing, server signature verification, and connection state management.",
  "sources": "User credentials (username, password), server responses containing authentication data, cryptographic functions (hmac, hashlib), nonce generation via SystemRandom.",
  "sinks": "Cryptographic operations (HMAC, PBKDF2), JSON encoding/decoding, base64 encoding/decoding, network message exchanges during handshake.",
  "flows": "Input of credentials and server responses → cryptographic processing (nonce, hashing, signature verification) → state transitions → message exchanges with server.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious network activity, standard cryptographic practices followed, cache used for performance optimization.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard SCRAM-SHA-256 handshake, with proper cryptographic procedures, nonce handling, and state management. No malicious or suspicious patterns are present. Cryptographic functions are used appropriately, following RFC standards. The caching mechanism is a typical optimization, not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are detected. The code is clear, well-structured, and aligns with secure practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure implementation of SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication for RethinkDB clients. It demonstrates proper cryptographic handling without any signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The overall security posture is high, with no vulnerabilities or malicious indicators.",
