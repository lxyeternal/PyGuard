  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate automation script with moderate security considerations. No malware or obfuscation detected. Risks mainly stem from unvalidated script execution and recursive retries. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.3-0.4 are appropriate. Recommendations include input validation, limiting retries, and removing unused variables. Overall, the code is safe for use with caution regarding input handling and robustness."
