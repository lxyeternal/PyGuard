  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-documented utility for managing RethinkDB indexes, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. Its capacity to drop and create indexes is part of its intended purpose, and it operates within a controlled environment. The low security risk scores are appropriate given its functionality. Overall, the dependency is safe and benign."
