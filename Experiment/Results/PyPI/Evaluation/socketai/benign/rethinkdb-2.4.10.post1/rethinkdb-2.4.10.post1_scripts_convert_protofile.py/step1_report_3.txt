  "purpose": "This script converts a .proto file into language-specific definitions (Python, Ruby, JavaScript) for code generation purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads input from a file specified by command-line options or standard input; reads environment variables indirectly via os.path.basename(__file__).",
  "sinks": "Writes output to a file specified by command-line options or standard output; no data leaks or untrusted data effects identified.",
  "flows": "Input file is read line-by-line, parsed using regex patterns, and translated into language-specific code snippets; output is written sequentially.",
  "anomalies": "Uses regex for parsing proto files, which is common; no suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets or backdoors; exception handling for file operations is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward file parsing and code generation based on regex pattern matching. It reads a proto file, matches message, enum, value, and closing braces, then writes corresponding language-specific code. No dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no malicious behavior detected. Error handling is limited to file operations. No suspicious variable names or obfuscated code structures are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign code generation tool for protobuf files, converting definitions into language-specific code. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior observed. It appears to be a legitimate utility with no security risks.",
