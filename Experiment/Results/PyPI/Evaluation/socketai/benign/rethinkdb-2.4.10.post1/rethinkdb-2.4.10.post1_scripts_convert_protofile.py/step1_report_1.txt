{
  "purpose": "The script converts a .proto file into language-specific definitions for Python, Ruby, or JavaScript, mainly for code generation purposes.",
  "sources": "Input file read via sys.stdin or specified with --input-file; environment variables (not used explicitly in code).",
  "sinks": "Output written to sys.stdout or specified output file; no untrusted data is written to external systems or network.",
  "flows": "Input file read -> parsing lines with regex -> writing generated code to output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors; code primarily performs straightforward file parsing and code generation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries (os, re, sys) and defines language-specific templates for code generation. It uses regex to parse message and enum definitions from a .proto file and writes the corresponding language-specific code. The code handles file input/output with error handling but does not process or execute external commands, network operations, or sensitive data. No evidence of obfuscated or malicious code patterns was found. The script is a code generator for proto files and does not include any malicious logic or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard code generation script with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It solely processes input files and produces language-specific code definitions for use in other applications.",
