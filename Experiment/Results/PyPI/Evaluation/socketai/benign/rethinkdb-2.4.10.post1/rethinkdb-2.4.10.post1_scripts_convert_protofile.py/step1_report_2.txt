{
  "purpose": "The script converts a .proto file into language-specific definitions (Python, Ruby, JavaScript) for code generation purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads input from a file or stdin; no external data sources or untrusted input sources identified.",
  "sinks": "Writes output to a file or stdout; no data exfiltration or untrusted data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Reads proto file lines (message and enum definitions) and writes formatted code snippets based on regex matches; no external data flows or untrusted sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. The code primarily performs file I/O and regex parsing; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code identified.",
  "analysis": "The script performs straightforward parsing of input proto files and generates code in specified languages based on templates. It uses regex matching to identify message/enumeration blocks and values, then formats and writes the output accordingly. File operations are limited to reading and writing, with no external network activity, code injection, or malicious payloads. The code includes standard error handling for file access issues. No indicators of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware signatures are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for converting proto definitions into language-specific code snippets. It does not contain any malicious intent or behavior, and no security risks are evident. The overall security risk is negligible.",
