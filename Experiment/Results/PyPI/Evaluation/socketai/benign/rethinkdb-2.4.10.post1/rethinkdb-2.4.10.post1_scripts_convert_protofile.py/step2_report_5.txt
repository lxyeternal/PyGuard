  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports describe the script as a straightforward code generator that converts .proto files into language-specific code snippets (Python, Ruby, JavaScript).\n- They uniformly state that the script performs file I/O, regex parsing, and code output without any network activity, external data sources, or malicious behavior.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), and all conclude the script is benign with negligible security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Logical Checks:\n\n- **Code Functionality:**  \n  The code reads a proto file, uses regex to identify message/enums and their values, and writes formatted code in the specified language.  \n  No parts of the code execute external commands, connect to networks, or handle sensitive data.  \n  The regex patterns are straightforward and appropriate for parsing proto syntax.\n\n- **Malicious Behavior & Anomalies:**  \n  No evidence of obfuscated code, backdoors, or malware.  \n  The script does not perform any suspicious operations such as code injection, data exfiltration, or privilege escalation.\n\n- **Potential Vulnerabilities:**  \n  The script's main risk could be related to untrusted input leading to malformed output or resource exhaustion, but given its purpose and implementation, such risks are minimal.  \n  The regex parsing is standard and not vulnerable to injection or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Scores & Justifications:\n\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis. No malicious activity is present.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n\n- **Risk Score:**  \n  All reports assign 0 or very low (not explicitly stated but implied). The script is a benign utility with no security risks.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n- No adjustments needed based on the current analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Systematic Estimation:\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe code is a standard, transparent code generator with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The regex parsing is appropriate for the task, and no external or untrusted operations are performed.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe overall assessment confirms that this is a benign, well-structured utility script for protobuf code generation, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
