{
  "purpose": "The code reads a .proto file, extracts message and enum definitions, and generates corresponding code in various programming languages (Python, Ruby, JavaScript).",
  "sources": "Input is read from a specified file or standard input; no untrusted data sources appear to be used directly within the code.",
  "sinks": "Output is written to a specified file or standard output; no sensitive data handling or external network connections are present.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed through regex matching, and the parsed content is transformed and written out to the output file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code structures are present. The code does not perform any network activity, system modifications, or external data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script performs file input/output operations, regex-based parsing of proto file syntax, and code generation for target languages. The functions and regex patterns are straightforward, with no indication of obfuscated or malicious behavior. The use of standard modules and typical code structure further supports this. No suspicious patterns, such as code execution from untrusted input or network activity, are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign file converter script that parses .proto definitions and generates language-specific code. There are no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or malware. It functions solely as a code generator without any harmful side effects.",
