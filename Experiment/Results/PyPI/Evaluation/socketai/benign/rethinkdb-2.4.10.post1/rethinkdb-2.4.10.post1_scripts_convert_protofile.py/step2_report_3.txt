  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the reports:**\n\n- All five reports consistently describe the script as a straightforward, regex-based parser and code generator converting .proto files into language-specific code snippets for Python, Ruby, or JavaScript.\n- No report indicates any suspicious behavior such as network activity, code injection, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.\n- The scripts handle file I/O with standard error handling, use regex for parsing, and generate code based on templates.\n- The overall confidence in these assessments is high (mostly 1.0), and all agree on the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious logic, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials.\n- No network activity or external data exfiltration.\n- The regex parsing is standard for such code generation scripts.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- The code relies on regex parsing, which can be brittle if the input proto files deviate from expected formatting, but this is typical for such scripts.\n- Error handling for file operations is standard; no security issues are apparent.\n- No logical flaws or security vulnerabilities are evident in the code.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign analysis.\n\n### Justifications:\n- The scripts are utility code generators, not executing untrusted code or performing malicious operations.\n- The regex parsing is straightforward and does not involve dynamic code execution.\n- No suspicious patterns or obfuscation are present.\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- The code is a benign, standard proto-to-language code generator.\n- The reports' conclusions are consistent and justified.\n- No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The script performs simple file parsing and code generation without any malicious or suspicious behavior. The consistent positive assessments across reports support this conclusion.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:**  \nThe reports are thorough and align with my analysis. The code is safe, with no security concerns.",
