{
  "purpose": "Definition of constants and class structures used for protocol, query, response, and data types in a Python client or server implementation.",
  "sources": "No input reading or data input points; primarily class and constant definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data output points; no untrusted data handling or processing.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow paths involving external or untrusted data sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of class and constant definitions with no executable or dynamic code; no suspicious code patterns or secrets present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides static class structures and constant mappings for protocol versions, query types, response types, data types, and term types. No functions, input/output, or dynamic execution are present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code segments are detected. The code appears autogenerated for protocol handling, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of static class definitions and constants used for protocol communication. It contains no executable logic, no input handling, and no suspicious or malicious patterns. The code is benign and appears to be part of a larger, non-malicious codebase.",
