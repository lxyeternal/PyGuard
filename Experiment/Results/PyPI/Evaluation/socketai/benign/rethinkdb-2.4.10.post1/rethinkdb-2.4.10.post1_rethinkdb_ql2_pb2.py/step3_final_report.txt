{
  "purpose": "This code defines static classes and constants representing protocol versions, message types, data types, and other enumerations for a schema or API, autogenerated from a protocol specification.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading; static class definitions and constants serve as schema declarations.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; purely declarative code with no data flow.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows; static constants used as schema references.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static class definitions with constants, representing protocol enums and versioning info. It is autogenerated, with no executable logic, data processing, or dynamic code. No signs of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious behavior are present. The structure is straightforward and schema-like, typical of protocol or API definitions. Given the static, declarative nature, the code poses no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static schema or protocol definition with no malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its nature, and the assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
