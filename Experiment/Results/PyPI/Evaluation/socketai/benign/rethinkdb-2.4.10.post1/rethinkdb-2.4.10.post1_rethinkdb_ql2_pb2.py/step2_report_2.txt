  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All reports describe the code as a set of class definitions, constants, and nested enums related to protocol, data types, query types, response types, etc.\n- They emphasize that the code is autogenerated, static, and contains no executable logic, input/output handling, or dynamic behavior.\n- No external data sources, sinks, or data flows are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n- The consensus is that this code is a schema or protocol definition, likely part of a client or server SDK, with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the presence of issues:\n- **Code content:** The code is purely static class and constant definitions with no executable logic, no input/output, no network operations, or data processing.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected; no signs of malware, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No vulnerabilities are evident, as there's no runtime logic or data handling.\n- **Suspicious constructs:** None; straightforward, autogenerated protocol/schema definitions.\n\n### Error or flaws in the reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify the nature of the code as non-malicious and schema-like.\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n- The high confidence scores (mostly 1.0) are justified given the static, declarative nature of the code.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or very low (0.9 in one case), which is reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- The only report with a risk score of 0.9 is slightly conservative but still reasonable. Since the code is purely static, the risk is minimal.\n- No justification for higher scores since no dynamic or executable code exists.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the code's static, schema-like nature.\n- No contradictions or suspicious claims.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (or very close, e.g., 0.1, but 0 is appropriate)\n\n### Overall conclusion:\nThis code is a static, autogenerated schema or protocol definition with no malicious or security concerns. It does not process data, perform I/O, or execute logic that could pose risks.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the consensus of the reports.",
