  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, well-structured backup utility for RethinkDB with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or supply chain compromise. The security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores should remain at 0. The overall risk score can be considered around 0.1 due to filesystem operations, but no active threat exists."
