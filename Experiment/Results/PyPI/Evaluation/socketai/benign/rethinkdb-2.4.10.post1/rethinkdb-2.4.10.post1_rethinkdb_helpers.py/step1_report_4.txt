  "purpose": "Utility functions for decoding UTF-8 strings and concatenating byte sequences, likely used for data processing.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to decode_utf8 (string), input parameters to chain_to_bytes (*strings).",
  "sinks": "Returns are built by decoding or concatenating data; no external sinks or outputs are directly present.",
  "flows": "Input strings are potentially transformed via decode_utf8 or concatenated into bytes, but no data flows into external systems or sensitive areas.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. Usage of six.b and hasattr for compatibility is standard. Functions are straightforward and typical.",
  "analysis": "The code provides two functions: decode_utf8 attempts to decode a string if it has a decode method, otherwise returns the input unchanged; chain_to_bytes concatenates multiple strings or byte objects into a single byte sequence, converting strings to bytes using six.b. Both functions are standard utility functions without any signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. No suspicious data handling, external communication, or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as utility functions for string decoding and byte concatenation. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks.",
