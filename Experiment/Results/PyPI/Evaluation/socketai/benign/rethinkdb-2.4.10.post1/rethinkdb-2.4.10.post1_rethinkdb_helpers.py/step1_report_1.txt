  "purpose": "Utility functions for decoding UTF-8 strings and concatenating byte sequences.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'string' in decode_utf8, and *strings in chain_to_bytes.",
  "sinks": "None identified that process untrusted data in a potentially harmful way.",
  "flows": "Input data is decoded or converted into bytes, then combined. No external data flow or network interaction is present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. Usage of 'six' is standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The decode_utf8 function attempts to decode a string if it has a 'decode' method, which is typical for byte objects. The chain_to_bytes function joins multiple strings or byte-like objects into a single byte sequence, converting strings to bytes using six.b(). Both functions serve typical utility purposes without involving untrusted data sources or malicious operations. There are no signs of obfuscated code, external data exfiltration, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of benign utility functions for string decoding and byte concatenation, with no malicious or suspicious behavior observed.",
