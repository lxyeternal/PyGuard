  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No. The code is standard utility functions for decoding and concatenating strings/bytes. No malicious behavior, no external data flow, no suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes?**  \n  None identified. The reasoning is sound; the functions are straightforward.\n\n- **Scores Review:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct, no obfuscation.  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0 — justified.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No. Similar to Report 1, the functions are benign.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  None. The reasoning is consistent.\n\n- **Scores Review:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — correct.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0 — justified.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No. Again, utility functions with no malicious intent.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  None.\n\n- **Scores Review:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0 — justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No. Functions are benign.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  None.\n\n- **Scores Review:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0 — justified.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No. The functions are simple utility functions with no malicious activity.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  None.\n\n- **Scores Review:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — correct.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0 — justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is benign utility functions.\n- The scores assigned are consistent and reasonable.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n### Final recommendation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports.  \n- **Risk score:** 0 across all reports.\n\n**Additional note:**  \nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of the code, I agree with the assessments. No adjustments needed.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is standard, harmless utility functions for string handling, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
