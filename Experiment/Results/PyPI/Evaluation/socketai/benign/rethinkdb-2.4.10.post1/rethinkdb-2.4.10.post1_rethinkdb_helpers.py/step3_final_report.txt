  "purpose": "Utility functions for decoding UTF-8 strings and concatenating multiple strings or byte-like objects into a single byte string.",
  "sources": "The functions read input from function parameters: 'string' in decode_utf8, and multiple strings in chain_to_bytes.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data flows to untrusted sources are present; functions operate solely on input parameters.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed locally; no external data flows or network interactions are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of 'six' is standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises two straightforward utility functions: 'decode_utf8' attempts to decode a string if possible; 'chain_to_bytes' joins multiple strings or byte-like objects into a single byte string. Both functions are standard, with no external data flow, network activity, or malicious payloads. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The functions serve common purposes and are implemented in a clear, conventional manner.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard utility functions with no malicious intent or security risks. The provided reports correctly identify the benign nature, and the assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
