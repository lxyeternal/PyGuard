  "purpose": "The code defines a version string and imports a process function from a local module named parsers.",
  "sources": "The code reads the VERSION string and the imported process function from the parsers module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code fragment; no data is sent to external systems or used in a way that could cause harm.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks in this minimal code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is very minimal; no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement and a version string declaration. It does not include any data processing, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The import is local, suggesting modular design. No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this small code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The code appears benign and standard for package initialization or version declaration.",
