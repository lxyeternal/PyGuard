  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- The code is minimal, only defining a version string and importing a local function.  \n- No data flows, no suspicious patterns, no anomalies.  \n- The confidence is high (1.0).  \n- Malware score is 0, which aligns with the benign assessment.  \n- Security risk is low (0.1), consistent with the benign nature.  \n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Similar minimal code: version string and local import.  \n- No data flows or suspicious constructs.  \n- Confidence is high (1).  \n- Malware score is 0, which is correct.  \n- Security risk is low (0).  \n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Same pattern: version string and local import.  \n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns.  \n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still high.  \n- Malware score is 0, matching the benign assessment.  \n- Security risk is 0.1.  \n**Verdict:** No issues; scores seem reasonable.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Again, minimal code with version string and local import.  \n- No anomalies or suspicious behavior.  \n- Confidence is perfect (1).  \n- Malware score is 0, consistent with benign code.  \n- Security risk is 0.  \n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Same minimal pattern.  \n- No anomalies, no suspicious patterns.  \n- Confidence is 1.  \n- Malware score is 0.  \n- Security risk is 0.  \n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n- The security risk scores are very low, reflecting the minimal nature of the code.\n- The confidence levels are high, matching the straightforward analysis.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores across all reports are consistent and justified.\n- Since the code is purely structural with no dynamic or external interactions, no changes are necessary.\n- The risk scores are correctly low, and malware scores correctly indicate no malicious activity.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, since the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2, considering the minimal code and no apparent vulnerabilities.\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, and the reports' assessments and scores are accurate.",
