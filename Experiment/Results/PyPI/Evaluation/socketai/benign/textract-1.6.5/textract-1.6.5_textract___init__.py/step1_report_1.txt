  "purpose": "The code defines a version string for a module and imports a processing function from a local parser module.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .parsers import process",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or output operations",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flows from sources to sinks within this snippet",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, containing an import statement and a version string. The import is a standard local import, and the version string is a straightforward variable assignment. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hidden code, or suspicious patterns. No external data sources or outputs are present that could indicate malicious flows.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign, serving as part of a larger module with no evident malicious intent or security issues.",
