  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- The code is minimal: a version string and a local import.\n- No untrusted data, no output, no suspicious patterns.\n- Confidence is high (1.0), malware is 0, obfuscated is 0.\n- Security risk is low (0.1), which seems appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is accurate; no issues found.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar minimal code: version string and local import.\n- No data flows, no suspicious constructs.\n- Confidence is high (1), malware 0, obfuscated 0.\n- Security risk is minimal (0), consistent with benign code.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct assessment; no issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same pattern: version string and local import.\n- No anomalies, no suspicious behavior.\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still reasonable.\n- Malware score is 0, obfuscated 0.\n- Security risk is low (0.1).\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate; no malicious activity.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same minimal structure.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- Confidence is 1, malware 0, obfuscated 0.\n- Security risk is 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly identified as benign.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same pattern: version string + import.\n- No suspicious activity or anomalies.\n- Confidence 1, malware 0, obfuscated 0.\n- Security risk 0.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code snippet.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a standard module snippet, typical in Python packages, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- Malware score should remain 0.\n- Obfuscated score remains 0.\n- Risk score should stay at or near 0, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the provided evaluations.**",
