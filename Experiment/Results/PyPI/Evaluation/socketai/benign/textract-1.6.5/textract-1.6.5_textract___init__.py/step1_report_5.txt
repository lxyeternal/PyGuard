{
  "purpose": "The code defines a version string and imports a function from a local module, likely for processing data.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .parsers import process reads data from a local module within the package.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "There is a straightforward flow of importing a local function; no data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns are present. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single import statement and a version string declaration. It does not perform any input/output operations, data processing, or network activity. The import is from a local module, which is standard and not suspicious. The version string is a common practice for package management. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger module with standard structure.",
