  "purpose": "Define a version string and import a processing function from a local module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .parsers module, assigns a string to VERSION.",
  "sinks": "No direct sink detected; no untrusted data handling or external outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; import is static, version string is constant.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no hardcoded credentials, secrets, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function from a local module and defines a static version string. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The import is relative, suggesting a modular codebase, and the version string appears to be for identification. Overall, the code is minimal and typical for a Python package.\n\nNo suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious signals are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment appears benign, serving as part of a larger package with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
