{
  "purpose": "To assess the security posture of a minimal Python module containing a version string and a local import, ensuring no malicious behavior or vulnerabilities are present.",
  "sources": "The import statement from a local module '.parsers' and the VERSION string declaration.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input, output data, or interact with external systems.",
  "flows": "The code imports a function 'process' from a local module; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks as there are no such elements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of an import statement and a version string. It does not perform any input/output, network activity, or dynamic operations. All review reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0 and low security risk scores (~0.1). The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features justify these assessments. No evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities is present. The scores are consistent with the code's characteristics, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The existing reports accurately reflect its safe nature, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action or score modifications are required.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
