{
  "purpose": "Extracts visible text from HTML files, replacing tables with ASCII representations and filtering out non-visible elements.",
  "sources": "Reads HTML content from a file specified by filename.",
  "sinks": "None identified; code does not output untrusted data or send data externally.",
  "flows": "Reads file content -> Parses with BeautifulSoup -> Replaces tables -> Filters visible elements -> Extracts text -> Returns concatenated string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns found. Uses standard libraries and parsing logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward HTML parser that extracts visible text. It filters out disallowed tags and comments, replaces tables with ASCII art, and unwraps inline elements. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications. It employs standard libraries and methods for HTML parsing and text extraction. No obfuscated code or malicious logic detected. The only potential concern is the file reading operation, which is typical for such a utility and does not pose a security threat in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs benign HTML parsing and text extraction without any malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and focused solely on text processing.",
