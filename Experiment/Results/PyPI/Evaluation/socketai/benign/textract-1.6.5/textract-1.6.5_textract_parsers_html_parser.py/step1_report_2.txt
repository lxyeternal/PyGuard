{
  "purpose": "The code extracts visible text from HTML files using BeautifulSoup, filtering out non-visible parts and replacing tables with ASCII representations.",
  "sources": "Reads HTML data from a file specified by 'filename' parameter, using file I/O and BeautifulSoup parsing.",
  "sinks": "None identified. The code processes data internally without writing or transmitting untrusted data elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Reads data from file -> Parses HTML -> Filters visible elements -> Converts tables -> Unwraps inline tags -> Returns plain text output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, no external network communication, and no suspicious data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes standard libraries (re, six, bs4) for HTML parsing and manipulation. It filters visible text, replaces tables with ASCII equivalents, and unwraps inline tags for cleaner text extraction. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful system commands. All operations are contained within the local file processing context. The logic appears straightforward and intended solely for text extraction, with no suspicious code flows or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign HTML text extractor without any malicious intent. It processes HTML files to produce clean text output, with no evidence of malicious or sabotage behavior.",
