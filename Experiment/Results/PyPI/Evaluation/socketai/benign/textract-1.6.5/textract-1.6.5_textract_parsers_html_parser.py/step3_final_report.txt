  "purpose": "Extracts visible text from HTML files, filtering out non-visible elements, converting tables to ASCII, and unwrapping inline tags for clean text output.",
  "sources": "Reads HTML content from a file stream, accesses HTML tags and comments via BeautifulSoup.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data transmission, network activity, or untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Reads HTML -> Parses with BeautifulSoup -> Filters visible elements -> Converts tables -> Unwraps inline tags -> Extracts text.",
  "anomalies": "Uses regex to match comments (`<!--.*-->`), which may be insufficient for multi-line comments but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard HTML parsing and text extraction tasks with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation. Regex is used solely for comment filtering, and no secrets or credentials are embedded. The functions are straightforward, and the logic aligns with benign HTML processing. No suspicious patterns, external calls, or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward HTML text extractor utility with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors. The existing scores of malware 0, securityRisk 0, obfuscated 0 are accurate and justified.",
