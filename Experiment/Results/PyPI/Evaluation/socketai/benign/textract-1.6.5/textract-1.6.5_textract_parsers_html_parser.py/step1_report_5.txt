{
  "purpose": "Extracts visible text from HTML files using BeautifulSoup, filters out non-visible content, and converts tables to ASCII representations.",
  "sources": "Reads HTML content from a file specified by filename.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes data to untrusted locations, but it processes HTML content and could potentially expose data if misused.",
  "flows": "Reads HTML from file -> parses with BeautifulSoup -> filters and processes elements -> outputs plain text string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity or file operations beyond standard HTML parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily utilizes BeautifulSoup to parse and process HTML content, filtering out non-visible elements and converting tables into ASCII format for cleaner output. It unwraps inline elements and compiles the visible text into a string. There are no suspicious or malicious code patterns such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The functions perform safe string manipulations, regex-based filtering, and HTML modifications. Overall, the code appears to serve a legitimate purpose related to HTML text extraction without any hidden malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe HTML text extraction utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It operates solely on provided HTML files and transforms them into text, with no network activity, credential handling, or data leaks detected.",
