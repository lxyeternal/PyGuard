{
  "purpose": "The code extracts visible text content from HTML files, filtering out non-visible elements and converting tables to ASCII format for simplified output.",
  "sources": "Reads HTML content from a file specified by filename, using BeautifulSoup to parse the data.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that execute or handle untrusted data in a way that could cause harm; primarily processes and transforms HTML content.",
  "flows": "Reads file content -> Parses with BeautifulSoup -> Filters visible elements -> Replaces tables with ASCII -> Joins inline elements -> Extracts and returns text",
  "anomalies": "Uses regex for HTML comment detection; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or external network calls detected.",
  "analysis": "The code securely processes HTML content for text extraction, employing standard libraries and practices. It filters non-visible content and converts tables to ASCII, with no signs of malicious behavior. The code does not perform network operations, handle sensitive data, or execute untrusted code. All processing appears benign, with no backdoors, data exfiltration, or other malicious patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign HTML text extractor that safely processes input files to produce visible text output, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
