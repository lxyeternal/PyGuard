{
  "purpose": "Extracts visible text from HTML files using BeautifulSoup, filtering out non-visible elements and converting tables to ASCII representation.",
  "sources": "Reads HTML content from a file specified by filename.",
  "sinks": "Uses BeautifulSoup to parse HTML; no direct untrusted data sink such as network, file writing, or execution of untrusted code is evident.",
  "flows": "Reads HTML file -> Parses with BeautifulSoup -> Filters and processes HTML elements -> Replaces tables with ASCII -> Returns cleaned text.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no use of dynamic code execution, no suspicious network activity, or unusual code patterns. The code performs straightforward HTML parsing and manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard libraries (re, six, bs4) to parse HTML content and extract visible text. It filters out non-visible elements and converts tables into ASCII art. There are no signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or malicious logic. The functions are purely for HTML processing. No network activity, no data leakage mechanisms, or credential handling are present. The only potential concern is the use of 'lxml' parser, but this is a common practice and not suspicious. Overall, the code appears to be a benign HTML parser with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard HTML parsing utility designed for extracting visible text and converting tables into ASCII. There are no indications of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks within this code fragment.",
