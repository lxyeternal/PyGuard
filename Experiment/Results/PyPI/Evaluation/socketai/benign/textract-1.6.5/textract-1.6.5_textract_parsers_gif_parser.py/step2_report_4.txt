  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Issue presence:** The report correctly notes that the code is a simple import statement with no signs of malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Confidence is 0.3, malware 0, securityRisk 0. The low confidence seems appropriate given the minimal code.  \n- **Assessment:** No issues here; the report is accurate.\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as above, a straightforward import statement.  \n- **Scores:** Confidence is high at 0.9, malware 0, securityRisk 0.1.  \n- **Justification for scores:** Since it's just an import, the malware score should be 0 unless there's evidence of malicious code, which there isn't. The securityRisk score of 0.1 seems slightly high; a simple import generally shouldn't carry any risk unless context suggests otherwise.  \n- **Recommendation:** Reduce securityRisk to 0, unless additional context indicates otherwise.\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as above, standard import.  \n- **Scores:** Confidence is 1, malware 0, securityRisk 0.  \n- **Assessment:** The high confidence is justified, and the scores are appropriate. No issues.\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as above.  \n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.8, malware 0, securityRisk 0.  \n- **Assessment:** The scores are consistent with the minimal code and lack of suspicious activity.\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as above.  \n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.3, malware 0, securityRisk 0.  \n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is correct given the code snippet. No signs of malicious behavior are present.  \n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, consistent with the straightforward import statements.  \n- **Risk scores:** Most are 0, except for Report 2, which has a 0.1. Given the simplicity of the code, even this seems slightly high. A more accurate score would be 0, unless there's external context indicating risk.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Adjust the securityRisk score for Report 2 from 0.1 to 0** to better reflect the benign nature of the code.  \n- **Maintain malware and obfuscated scores at 0** across all reports, as there's no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n### My own estimates based on the analysis:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 for all reports  \n- **Risk score:** 0 for all reports, including Report 2\n\n**Summary:** The code snippets are benign import statements with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores should reflect this, with the only adjustment being lowering the securityRisk for Report 2 to 0.",
