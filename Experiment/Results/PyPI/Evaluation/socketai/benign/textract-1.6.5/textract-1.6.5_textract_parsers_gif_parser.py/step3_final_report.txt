  "purpose": "Import the Parser class from the image module, likely for image processing or parsing tasks.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; this is a static import statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a straightforward import with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import statement importing Parser from the image module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data leakage. The minimal code context and standard import pattern indicate benign intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's nature. Slight variations in confidence are justified given the minimal code, but overall, the code poses no security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with no malicious or suspicious behavior. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or suspicion is warranted.",
  "confidence": 1,
