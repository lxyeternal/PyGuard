{
  "purpose": "Import the 'Parser' class or function from the local 'image' module.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the 'image' module from the local package/directory.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potentially dangerous operations are present in this line.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks is evident in this single line.",
  "anomalies": "This code is a simple import statement; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard import of 'Parser' from a relative module 'image'. This is typical in Python packages and does not exhibit malicious behavior. Since this is only a single import statement, there are no suspicious or malicious activities, backdoors, or data exfiltration signs visible. The code's simplicity suggests it is part of a larger module, but on its own, it does not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no malicious intent or security concerns identified. It appears benign and typical of Python package code.",
