  "purpose": "Import the 'Parser' class or function from the local 'image' module.",
  "sources": "Import statement sourcing 'Parser' from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or output functions.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted input handling observed in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, only a relative import statement; no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward relative import of 'Parser' from the 'image' module. There are no data inputs, no processing, no network calls, and no suspicious constructs. Given the limited content, there are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. Without additional context or code, it is impossible to determine malicious behavior from this single import statement alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no apparent malicious behavior or security concerns. It is typical in Python projects and does not pose any threat based on this fragment.",
