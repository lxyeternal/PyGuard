  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** Defines custom exception classes for command-line errors, extension support, missing files, unknown methods, and shell command failures. Uses standard Python modules (`os`) and safe string formatting.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. Data is used solely for error messaging. No external data flows or code injection risks.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are appropriately low (risk 0.1, malware 0). The reasoning aligns with the code's functionality.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on command-line error handling with safe usage of `os` and string formatting.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity. The code is straightforward, with no external data leaks or network activity.\n- **Scores:** Consistent and justified (risk 0.1, malware 0).\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Defines exception classes for CLI errors, with standard practices. Uses `os` for environment info.\n- **Findings:** No malicious intent, no obfuscation, no external data leaks.\n- **Scores:** Appropriately low; the reasoning matches the code's benign nature.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Exception classes for errors in command-line operations, with use of `os` and safe string formatting.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behaviors, no external data flows beyond error messages.\n- **Scores:** Justified as low risk and malware.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Error classes handling file and command errors, embedding user data into messages.\n- **Findings:** While user input is included in error messages, this is standard practice and does not indicate malicious intent. No network or system manipulation.\n- **Scores:** Correctly low; no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is primarily for error handling, with no malicious or obfuscated code present.\n- **Security Risks:** Very low, as the code only formats and displays error messages based on input parameters.\n- **Malware Potential:** None detected. The code does not perform any dynamic execution, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Scores:** I agree with the provided scores: malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk scores around 0.1-0.2 reflecting minimal risk due to user input in error messages.\n- **Justification:** The code is standard error handling infrastructure, with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to potential information leakage if error messages are logged or exposed, but not inherently risky)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, well-structured, and typical for CLI error handling modules. No security concerns or malware risks are evident.",
