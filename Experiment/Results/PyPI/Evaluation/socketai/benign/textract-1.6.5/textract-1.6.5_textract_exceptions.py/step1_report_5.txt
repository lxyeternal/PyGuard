{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for command-line interface errors related to file processing and shell command execution.",
  "sources": "os module (for environment info and file path manipulation), self.command (user input), stdout/stderr (command output).",
  "sinks": "Error messages that include user-provided data such as filenames, method names, commands, and command outputs.",
  "flows": "User input (filename, method, command) flows into exception objects; these objects generate messages that include this data, potentially leaking information if not sanitized.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. The code uses standard exception handling and string formatting. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of exception classes designed to provide informative error messages during command-line operations. It uses straightforward string interpolation and the os module for environment checks and path handling. The only data sources are user inputs (filenames, commands, method names), which are embedded into error messages, but these are controlled and limited to error reporting. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious system modifications are evident. The code appears to be a typical error handling module with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign error handling module with no malicious behavior detected. It handles exceptions related to file operations and shell command execution, providing user-friendly messages. There are no signs of malware or security risks.",
