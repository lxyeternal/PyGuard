{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for command-line error handling and related functionalities in a Python package.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include exception parameters such as filenames, command strings, and error messages.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur if exception data (like filenames, command outputs) are exposed outside the class or logs; however, the code only formats messages without external data transmission.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters to formatted string messages used in __str__ methods; no external network or storage interactions are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or malicious patterns observed. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. Use of 'vars(self)' for string rendering is standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of custom exceptions for handling command-line errors, with methods for rendering error messages. It imports 'os' for environment detection and uses exception parameters to generate messages. There are no indicators of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward and does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or sensitive data handling beyond error message formatting.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate part of a command-line utility package, providing error handling and messaging functionalities. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
