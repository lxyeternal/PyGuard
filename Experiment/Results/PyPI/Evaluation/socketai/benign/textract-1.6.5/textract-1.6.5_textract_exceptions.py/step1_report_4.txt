{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for command-line errors, file handling, and shell command execution within a text extraction tool.",
  "sources": "os module for environment information; imported functions from relative parsers module for extension support.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes to external systems, network, or files; it primarily handles errors and string formatting.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; error messages are formatted with internal data, and no user input or external data is processed or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative import (.parsers), but this is not inherently malicious; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides structured exception classes for handling errors related to command-line operations, missing files, unsupported extensions, unknown methods, and shell command failures. It uses standard Python practices such as exception inheritance, string formatting, and environment checks. No suspicious code, external data flows, or potentially malicious behaviors identified. The use of os and string formatting appears safe and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom error classes for a command-line tool, with no signs of malicious intent, malicious data handling, or security risks. It is well-structured but lacks external data interaction or system manipulation that could be exploited.",
