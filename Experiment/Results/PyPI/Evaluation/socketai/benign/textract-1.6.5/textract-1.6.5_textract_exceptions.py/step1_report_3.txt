{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for command-line interface errors related to file handling, extension support, method support, and shell command execution.",
  "sources": "Input sources include exception parameters (ext, filename, method, command, stdout, stderr), and os module functions like os.name. No external untrusted input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "String formatting with self attributes for error messages, os.path.splitext for filename processing, and subprocess-like command handling (split). No external data sinks or network communication observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into exception instances and are used in string rendering for messages. No external data flows into or out of the code; error handling is internal.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no dynamic execution. Use of os and string formatting is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes for specific CLI error scenarios, with message rendering methods. It imports 'os' for environment checks and filename parsing. The classes use parameters passed at instantiation for generating error messages, with no external data input, network activity, or code injection. No indications of malicious intent or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured set of custom exception classes intended for error handling in a CLI tool. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It functions solely to report errors related to file handling, unsupported extensions, and shell command execution.",
