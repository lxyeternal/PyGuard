{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for command-line error handling, extension support issues, missing files, unknown methods, and shell command failures.",
  "sources": "User input data embedded in error messages, parameters passed during exception instantiation (e.g., filename, extension, command, exit code, stdout, stderr).",
  "sinks": "Error message rendering functions that include user-supplied data, potentially exposing sensitive info if logs are accessible.",
  "flows": "Input data (filename, extension, command, output) flows into exception objects, which generate formatted error messages for display or logging.",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative import (`from .parsers import _get_available_extensions`) but no malicious patterns; no obfuscation or suspicious code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard custom exception classes for CLI error handling, utilizing safe practices such as `os` module functions and string formatting. No external data is transmitted or malicious code executed. User input is incorporated into error messages, which could leak sensitive info if logs are exposed, but this is typical in error reporting and not malicious. The import statement is standard for package modules and does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code is straightforward, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of CLI error handling classes with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are justified and appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
