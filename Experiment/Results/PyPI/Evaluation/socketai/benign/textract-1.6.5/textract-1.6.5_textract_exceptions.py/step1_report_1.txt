{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for command-line errors, extension support issues, missing files, unknown methods, and shell command failures, with functions for rendering error messages.",
  "sources": "os module for environment checks and file path operations; class constructors receiving external input (e.g., filenames, methods, commands).",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; error message rendering uses string formatting but no external or untrusted data handling that could lead to code injection or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (filename, method, command, exit code, stdout, stderr) are used directly in string formatting for messages but do not influence system behavior beyond message display.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors; no obfuscated code or malicious payloads; code appears standard for error handling and messaging.",
  "analysis": "The code provides structured exception classes with methods for rendering error messages. Data is mainly used for display, with input parameters stored as attributes. The only external call is to os.path.splitext and os.name, which are safe and standard. No dynamic execution, code injection, or malicious data handling is present. The import of the os module is typical, and the class methods do not execute untrusted code. There are no signs of obfuscated code or hidden malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as error handling infrastructure with no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It relies on standard Python practices for exception definition and message formatting. The overall security risk is very low.",
