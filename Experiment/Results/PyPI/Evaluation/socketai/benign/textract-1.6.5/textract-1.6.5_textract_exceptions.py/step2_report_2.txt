  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code content.\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n- Defines several custom exception classes for command-line errors, file handling, extension support, shell command failures, etc.\n- Uses standard Python modules (`os`) for environment detection and path operations.\n- Error messages are generated via string formatting with parameters provided at exception instantiation.\n- No external data is fetched or transmitted; no network activity, no code execution beyond exception handling.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code patterns are present.\n- The code appears to be standard error handling infrastructure for a CLI utility.\n\n---\n\n### **Confirmations & Observations:**\n- **Code presence:** All classes and methods described are present and match the reports.\n- **Errors & Flaws:** No logical errors, no signs of malicious behavior, no suspicious imports or code patterns.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware scores as 0, obfuscated as 0, and low security risks, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- **External interactions:** Only `os` module functions, which are safe and standard.\n- **Potential leaks:** User input (filenames, commands) are embedded in error messages but are not transmitted externally or stored insecurely.\n- **Relative import:** The only unusual aspect is the relative import (`from .parsers import _get_available_extensions`), but this is typical in package code and not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Specific Analysis per Report:**\n\n#### **Report 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5:**\n- All conclude **no malicious activity, malware, or obfuscation**.\n- The data flows are limited to internal error message generation.\n- No external data sources or sinks beyond local error reporting.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution.\n- The use of `vars(self)` for message rendering is safe here.\n\n**Potential concern:** The only point that could be scrutinized is the `from .parsers import _get_available_extensions` line. If this module is malicious or compromised, it could introduce risks. However, based on the reports, this import appears standard, and no malicious behavior is indicated.\n\n---\n\n### **Scores & Justifications:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Very low (around 0.1), consistent with error handling code.\n\n**Any higher risk score?** No, the code is purely for error reporting and does not perform any system modifications or data exfiltration.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Assessment & Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (appropriate, given it’s error handling code)\n- **Potential for malicious activity:** None evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, well-structured set of custom exception classes used for error handling in a CLI tool. It does not contain any malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious code. The reports are consistent with this assessment.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports, confirming the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always ensure that the imported modules, especially relative ones like `.parsers`, are from trusted sources. If this package is open source and maintained securely, the code is safe.",
