  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** The code defines exception classes with message rendering; no malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors. Uses standard modules (`os`) safely. No external data handling beyond message formatting.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, which is consistent with the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues or malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, the code is straightforward exception classes for CLI error handling. No external data leaks, no network activity, no malicious code.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, aligning with the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate error handling code, no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Exception classes for CLI errors, with safe use of `os` and string formatting. No suspicious patterns or malicious activity.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, which seems appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No evidence of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports, standard custom exception classes with no malicious activity. Use of relative import is noted but not suspicious.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** No security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Exception classes that include user-controlled data in error messages, which could potentially leak sensitive info if such data is sensitive. However, the code does not perform data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious modifications.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 seems reasonable given the absence of malicious intent, but the report notes potential information leakage. Since this is about error reporting, the risk is minimal but worth noting.\n- **Malware Score:** 0, which is correct; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is benign, primarily error reporting, with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Code Presence & Functionality:** All reports describe code that is purely for error handling and messaging, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores Justification:** All malware scores are 0, which is appropriate. Risk scores are low (mostly 0 or 0.1), reflecting minimal security concerns—mainly potential information leakage, which is typical in error messages.\n- **Potential Concerns:** The only minor concern is that error messages include user input data, which could leak sensitive info if not sanitized, but this is standard practice in error reporting and not malicious.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — very low, possibly increased slightly if sensitive data leakage is a concern, but generally acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code appears to be standard error handling classes with no malicious or obfuscated components. The scores assigned are appropriate given the evidence. No changes are necessary.\n\n**Final estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis reflects a low-security risk, with no malware or malicious intent present.",
