  "purpose": "Extract text content from pptx presentation files using the python-pptx library.",
  "sources": "Reads the filename parameter to load a presentation; accesses pptx.Presentation to load the file; iterates over presentation slides, shapes, paragraphs, and text runs.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code only reads data from the file and processes it locally.",
  "flows": "Input filename -> Load presentation object -> Iterate over slides/shapes/paragraphs/runs -> Collect text -> Return concatenated text.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, no dynamic execution, and no external network activity observed. The code appears straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the pptx library and a local utility module, then defines a Parser class inheriting from BaseParser. The extract method loads a presentation file based on the filename argument, then iterates over all slides and shapes to extract text from text frames. It accumulates all text runs into a list and returns the combined text. No external data sources, network calls, or malicious code patterns are present. The code is focused solely on reading and processing presentation files without performing any actions that could be malicious or insecure.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple, legitimate task of extracting text from pptx files with no apparent malicious intent or security issues. It does not contain obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks based on the provided code.",
