  "purpose": "Extract text content from pptx files for further processing or analysis.",
  "sources": "Filename input to pptx.Presentation, reading slide shapes and text runs.",
  "sinks": "Return statement concatenates text; no external untrusted data output or network activity.",
  "flows": "Filename input -> pptx.Presentation -> slide and shape parsing -> text collection -> return text.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code; no obfuscated patterns or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard library (python-pptx) and a local utility module. It defines a class that extends BaseParser, with an extract method that opens a pptx file, iterates over slides and shapes to collect text, then returns the concatenated text. There are no external data transmissions, no eval or exec usage, and no suspicious operations. The code is straightforward and appears to serve a legitimate purpose of text extraction. No anomalies or malicious indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple, legitimate task of extracting text from PowerPoint files without any malicious behavior. It does not contain malware or security risks based on the provided code. Overall, the code appears safe.",
