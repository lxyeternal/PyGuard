{
  "purpose": "Extract text from pptx files using the python-pptx library",
  "sources": "Reading the filename input and loading pptx.Presentation from the filename",
  "sinks": "None that directly lead to data leaks or security effects; primarily reads file data",
  "flows": "Filename input -> pptx.Presentation -> access to slides and shapes -> extract text runs",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, and no dynamic execution or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard library (python-pptx) and a local utility module. It defines a Parser class with an extract method that opens a presentation file given by filename. It iterates through slides, shapes, and text runs to collect text content, then joins and returns it. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or data exfiltration. The code performs straightforward text extraction without performing any network activity, executing code, or handling sensitive data in insecure ways.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for extracting text from pptx files. No malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks are present.",
