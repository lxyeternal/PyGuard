  "purpose": "Extract text content from pptx presentation files using the python-pptx library.",
  "sources": "Input filename parameter used in pptx.Presentation to load the file.",
  "sinks": "Return statement providing concatenated text from the presentation; no other data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Input filename -> pptx.Presentation -> Extracted text -> Return output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious imports. Use of a third-party library (python-pptx) is standard for this purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from BaseParser, with a method to extract text from pptx files. It loads the presentation file specified by filename, iterates through slides, shapes, paragraphs, and text runs to compile text content. The process is straightforward and does not include any suspicious or malicious operations, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. No sensitive data handling, environment variables, or insecure operations are present. The code solely reads the presentation file and extracts text.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for extracting text from PowerPoint files with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs its intended function safely without any suspicious behaviors.",
