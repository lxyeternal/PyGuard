  "purpose": "Extract text from pptx files using python-pptx library.",
  "sources": "Reading the pptx file via pptx.Presentation(filename). Accessing slide shapes and text frames.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only reads data, does not write or transmit untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input filename -> pptx.Presentation -> iterate slides/shapes -> extract text runs -> return concatenated text.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward text extraction with no suspicious or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code loads a pptx file, iterates over slides and shapes, extracts text from text frames, and joins the text. No obfuscation, malicious code, or network activity is present. The filename input is untrusted, but this is typical for such utilities and does not imply malicious intent. The code relies on standard libraries and performs a benign operation. No logical flaws or security issues are evident. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) appropriately reflects the minimal risk associated with processing untrusted files, considering underlying library vulnerabilities are outside the scope of this code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and safe for extracting text from pptx files. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. No modifications are necessary.",
