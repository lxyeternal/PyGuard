{
  "purpose": "To parse and extract content from .txt files",
  "sources": "Reading data from a file specified by filename",
  "sinks": "File open/read operation; potential exposure of file contents if filename is untrusted",
  "flows": "Input filename -> open stream -> read content",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or malicious patterns detected; usage of standard file reading approach",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Parser class inheriting from BaseParser, with an extract method that opens a file and returns its content. It uses standard Python file handling with no apparent malicious behavior. No external data sources or untrusted inputs are processed in a suspicious way beyond normal file reading. No obfuscated code or unusual control flow detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a text file parser with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
