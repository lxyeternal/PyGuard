  "purpose": "Parse .txt files by reading their content",
  "sources": "Reading from a filename provided as input",
  "sinks": "Returning the content read from the file",
  "flows": "Input filename -> open() -> read() -> return content",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, no obfuscation, no malicious patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'Parser' inheriting from 'BaseParser' with a method 'extract' that opens a file given by 'filename' and returns its content. It uses standard file I/O without any suspicious operations. No external network calls, no dynamic code execution, and no data leakage mechanisms are present. The code appears straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, standard implementation for reading text files. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
