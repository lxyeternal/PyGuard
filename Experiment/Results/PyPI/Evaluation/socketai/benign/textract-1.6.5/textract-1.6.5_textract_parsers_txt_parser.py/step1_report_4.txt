{
  "purpose": "To parse and extract text content from `.txt` files.",
  "sources": "Reads data from a file specified by `filename` using the `open()` function.",
  "sinks": "The `open()` function and `stream.read()` where untrusted filename input could lead to file access or reading unintended files.",
  "flows": "Input filename -> open() -> stream.read() -> return data",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. The code straightforwardly reads file content.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a base parser class and defines a simple parser class for text files. The `extract()` method opens a file and reads its contents. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or obfuscated code. The use of `open()` with a filename parameter could be a concern if `filename` is untrusted, but that is typical for file I/O and does not necessarily indicate malicious intent. The code is minimal, clean, and directly serves its purpose without additional or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a basic file read operation with no evident malicious behavior or security risks. It is standard functionality for a parser class, with no signs of malware or obfuscation.",
