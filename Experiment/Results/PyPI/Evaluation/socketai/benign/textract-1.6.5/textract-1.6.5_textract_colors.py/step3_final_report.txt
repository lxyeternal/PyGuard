  "purpose": "Utility module for styling terminal output with ANSI color codes and removing such codes from text.",
  "sources": "Functions `_wrap_with` for applying color codes, color functions (e.g., red, green), and `colorless` for stripping codes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; purely string formatting and regex substitution.",
  "flows": "Input text is wrapped with ANSI codes via color functions; `colorless` removes codes via regex substitution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines color functions for terminal styling, with a utility to strip ANSI codes. No external inputs, network activity, or vulnerabilities are present. The reports are empty, providing no evidence of issues. The code is safe, simple, and standard for terminal styling purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The reports lack substantive analysis. Scores should be set to 0 for malware, obfuscation, and overall risk.",
