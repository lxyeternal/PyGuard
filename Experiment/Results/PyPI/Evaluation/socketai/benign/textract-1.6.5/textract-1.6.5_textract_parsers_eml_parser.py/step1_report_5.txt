  "purpose": "Extract text content from email messages in .eml format, focusing on subject and text/plain parts.",
  "sources": "Reads email data from a file specified by filename parameter, using open() and email.parser.Parser.",
  "sinks": "Uses get_payload() method on email parts, which could potentially process untrusted email content.",
  "flows": "Reads email file -> Parses email -> Iterates through parts -> Extracts 'text/plain' content -> Joins and returns text.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscation detected. Uses standard libraries and patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code loads an email file, parses it with the email.parser.Parser, and extracts text from parts identified as 'text/plain'. The process appears straightforward and standard. No data is sent over network, no execution of dynamic code, and no use of environment variables or insecure operations. It relies solely on standard Python email parsing capabilities to extract email content.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a typical email parser extracting text content, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues. It does not contain backdoors, suspicious network activity, or unsafe code patterns.",
