  "purpose": "Extract text content from email messages in .eml format, focusing on subject and plain text content.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the file specified by 'filename' using open().",
  "sinks": "Uses email.parser's parse() method to process email content; retrieves payloads from email parts.",
  "flows": "File data -> email.parser.parse() -> walk() -> get_payload() -> return combined text.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. No suspicious network or system calls. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard email parsing procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code reads an email file specified by 'filename', parses it using Python's email.parser, and extracts all plain text parts. It avoids executing any code from the email or performing unsafe operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. Usage of standard libraries and simple file reading indicates low risk. No obfuscated or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign email content extractor with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard parsing and text extraction from email files.",
