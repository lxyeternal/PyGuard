  "purpose": "Extract text content from email messages in .eml format, focusing on plain text parts.",
  "sources": "Reads email file via open(), uses email.parser.EmailParser() to parse the email stream.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is sent to external systems or network.",
  "flows": "open() reads file -> EmailParser.parse() processes stream -> walk() iterates over parts -> get_payload() extracts text -> joins and returns text.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard email parsing using Python's email library. It reads a file, parses email structure, and extracts 'text/plain' parts. No network activity, code injection, or obfuscation present. The use of open() is straightforward; no validation or sanitization issues are evident but typical for such scripts. No malicious intent or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward email text extractor with no malicious behavior or security risks. All reports correctly assess it as safe, with malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and risk score 0. No adjustments are necessary.",
