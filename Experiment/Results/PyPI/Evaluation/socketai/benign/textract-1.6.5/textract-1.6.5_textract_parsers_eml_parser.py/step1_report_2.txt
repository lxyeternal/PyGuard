{
  "purpose": "Extracts text content from email messages in .eml format, focusing on subject and plain text parts.",
  "sources": "Reads the email file specified by filename; uses email.parser to parse the email content.",
  "sinks": "Reads the email file from disk; processes email content but does not write or transmit data elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Input filename -> open() -> EmailParser.parse() -> message.walk() -> get_payload() -> return concatenated text.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code reads an email file specified by filename, parses it using Python's email.parser module, and extracts all 'text/plain' parts. The open() function is used for reading files without any user input; no user-controlled data appears to influence the parsing process directly. No external network connections, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior are evident. The code is straightforward and aligns with typical email parsing routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard email parsing to extract text content without any malicious intent or security risks identified. It does not contain obfuscated or malicious code and appears safe for use.",
