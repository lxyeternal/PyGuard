{
  "purpose": "Extract text content from email messages in .eml format, focusing on subject and text/plain parts.",
  "sources": "Reads email file specified by filename; uses open() to read the email stream.",
  "sinks": "Uses email.parser's parse() method to process email content; appends payloads from email parts.",
  "flows": "open() reads email file -> EmailParser.parse() processes email stream -> iterates over message parts -> appends 'text/plain' payloads -> returns combined text",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or malicious patterns detected. No unusual language features or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code safely opens and reads an email file, then uses standard email parsing libraries to extract text. No external network calls, no data exfiltration, and no unsafe operations are present. It appears to be a straightforward email content extractor, with only commented placeholders for future enhancements.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign email parsing function without any signs of malicious intent or security risks. It follows standard practices for reading and extracting email content.",
