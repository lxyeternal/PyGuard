{
  "purpose": "Extracts plain text content from email messages in .eml format, specifically the subject and body text.",
  "sources": "Reads email file content via open(filename) and parses email data using the email.parser module.",
  "sinks": "Uses get_payload() on email parts, which could potentially process untrusted email content.",
  "flows": "File content is read from disk -> parsed into email message object -> walk through parts -> extract 'text/plain' parts -> return combined text.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The code appears straightforward for email parsing purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code reads an email file, parses it with Python's email.parser, and extracts all 'text/plain' parts. No external network connections or data leaks are present. It operates solely on provided files, with no evident malicious activity or obfuscation. Use of standard libraries and typical parsing logic suggests normal functionality. No anomalies such as embedded code execution, suspicious data handling, or malicious logic are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard email parser intended to extract text content from email files. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on its current implementation.",
