{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package named 'textract', specifying dependencies, scripts, and package metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading README file for description, reading requirements files for dependencies, globbing scripts from 'bin/*'.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted input data; setup configurations are static and do not execute external code or commands.",
  "flows": "Read dependencies from files -> populate setup parameters -> setup execution with static data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs static setup tasks: gathering scripts via glob, reading a README file for description, parsing requirement files for dependencies, and configuring package metadata with setuptools. It does not execute untrusted code, perform network operations, or manipulate data in a way that could lead to malicious actions. The recursive parsing of requirement files is standard practice. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious behavior observed. The code is straightforward and adheres to common Python packaging conventions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign setup script for packaging a Python project. No malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious anomalies are detected.",
