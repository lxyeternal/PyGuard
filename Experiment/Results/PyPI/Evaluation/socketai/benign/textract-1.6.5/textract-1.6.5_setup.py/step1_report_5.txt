{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for a Python package 'textract', used for extracting text from documents, including reading dependencies and preparing package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading README file for description, parsing requirements files for dependencies, glob for scripts in 'bin/*', importing textract module for package info.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling points identified; setup function mainly defines package metadata.",
  "flows": "Reading dependencies from files → setting up package metadata → no data flow involving untrusted input to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "Recursive parsing of requirements with handling of -r includes; no suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors; no obfuscated code or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily gathers package metadata, dependencies, and scripts for setup. It reads a README file and requirements files, then calls setuptools.setup() with this information. The requirements parser handles nested requirements and links, which is standard. No external network activity, code injection, or malicious logic is present. The code appears straightforward and adheres to common setup practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal setup script with no malicious intent, no suspicious behaviors, and no security risks detected. It responsibly manages dependencies and package metadata without any signs of sabotage or malware.",
