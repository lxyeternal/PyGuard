{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package named 'textract', designed to specify dependencies, scripts, and package information for installation.",
  "sources": "Reading README file, reading requirements files, globbing for scripts in 'bin/*'.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data flows into sensitive operations or external systems.",
  "flows": "Input data from requirements files and script files are processed for dependencies and scripts, respectively. No flow from untrusted input to sensitive operations is observed.",
  "anomalies": "The recursive parsing of requirements files is standard; no anomalies. The use of 'dependency_links' is deprecated and potentially risky if the links are untrusted, but this alone isn't malicious. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code reads and processes files for setup configuration, gathering scripts and dependencies. It performs recursive parsing of requirements files to include external links, which could be misused if malicious URLs are provided, but no malicious URLs are hardcoded. No suspicious code execution, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The code's purpose is straightforward package setup, and it does not contain any malicious or malicious-appearing code.",
  "conclusion": "This script functions as a benign setup configuration for packaging a Python project. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The use of 'dependency_links' should be noted as deprecated, but it does not constitute malicious intent. Overall, the code appears safe.",
