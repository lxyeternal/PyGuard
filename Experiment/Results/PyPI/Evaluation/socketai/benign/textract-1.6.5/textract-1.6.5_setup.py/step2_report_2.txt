  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a standard setup script for a Python package.\n- It reads static files (README, requirements) and collects scripts via glob.\n- The `parse_requirements` function handles nested requirements files and dependency links.\n- No dynamic code execution, network calls (besides dependency links), or obfuscation is present.\n- The use of `dependency_links` is deprecated but not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials.\n- No code injection, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation.\n- The only potential concern is the use of `dependency_links`, which is deprecated and could be risky if untrusted URLs are provided. However, this is a known issue, not a malicious one.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n- The recursive parsing of requirements files is standard but could be exploited if external files are maliciously crafted. Still, this is a common pattern and not inherently dangerous.\n- No code executes untrusted data or performs unsafe operations.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0. This is appropriate; no malicious code is present.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** Mostly 0.1 or 0. This is reasonable given the deprecated `dependency_links` usage, but not a security risk per se.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk score > 0.5, which is appropriate.\n- The highest is 0.1, reflecting minimal concern primarily about deprecated practices, not malicious intent.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All reports are consistent with the analysis: no malware, no obfuscation, low security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on the code and reports, I would assign the following scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| **0**   | **0**        | **0.1** |\n\n**Rationale:**\n- Malware: 0, no malicious code or behavior.\n- Obfuscated: 0, code is straightforward.\n- Risk: 0.1, due to deprecated `dependency_links` usage, which could be exploited if malicious URLs are supplied, but no evidence of malicious intent here.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard, benign setup script with no security risks or malware. The minor concern about `dependency_links` is a known deprecation issue but not malicious. All reports are accurate in their assessments.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed; the code is safe.",
