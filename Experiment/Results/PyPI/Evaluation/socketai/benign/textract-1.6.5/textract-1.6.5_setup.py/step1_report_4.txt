{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package named 'textract' for distribution, including reading dependencies, scripts, and metadata for packaging.",
  "sources": "Reading README file for long_description, parsing dependencies from requirements files, globbing script files from 'bin/*'.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or execute external commands unsafely; setup configuration is standard.",
  "flows": "Input reading from files (README, requirements), dependency parsing flow, and packaging data flow from source files to setup function.",
  "anomalies": "The recursive parsing of requirements files could lead to malformed dependencies if inputs are manipulated, but no hardcoded secrets or unusual code structures are evident. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks: reading long description, gathering scripts, parsing dependencies from requirement files, and configuring package metadata. The recursive dependency parsing is a potential point for malformed input if external files are compromised, but it does not execute any code or perform dangerous operations. No hardcoded credentials, network calls, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It properly reads dependencies and package info without executing untrusted code or data. The overall security risk is minimal.",
