{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distribution of the 'textract' Python project, including dependency management and script collection.",
  "sources": "Reading README.rst, reading requirements files, globbing scripts in 'bin/*', importing 'textract', and 'setuptools' for setup configuration.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the code mainly reads files and prepares setup parameters without executing untrusted data or code.",
  "flows": "Read dependencies from files -> Collect scripts -> Configure setup() with gathered data",
  "anomalies": "The recursive parsing of requirements files is standard; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic present.",
  "analysis": "The script reads static files (README, requirements) and collects scripts using glob. It then uses setuptools to configure package metadata and dependencies. The parse_requirements function handles nested requirements files and links, but does not execute any code beyond file reading and string processing. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious actions are evident. The overall structure is typical for a setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script for packaging the 'textract' Python project. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are identified. The script solely manages package metadata and dependencies.",
