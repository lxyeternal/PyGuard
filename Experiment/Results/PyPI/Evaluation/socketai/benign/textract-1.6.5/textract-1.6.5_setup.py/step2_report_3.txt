  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, assessing the reasoning, and ensuring the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard setup script with no malicious behavior, no code execution beyond file reading, no obfuscation, and no suspicious patterns.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The script only reads static files, collects scripts via glob, and configures package metadata. No code injection, network activity, or data leaks are present.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's confidence is high, and the assessment aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** **Accurate and reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing static setup tasks, no suspicious code, no dynamic execution.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The only potential concern is the use of `dependency_links`, which is deprecated and could be risky if untrusted URLs are provided, but this is not inherently malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — acceptable, considering deprecated practices.\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is consistent; no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Verdict:** **Appropriate and well-justified.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard setup script, with mention of `dependency_links` being deprecated but not malicious.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The recursive parsing could be misused if malicious URLs are supplied, but no such URLs are hardcoded.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** The report correctly identifies the potential concern but finds no actual malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** **Sound and justified.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard setup with no suspicious code, just recursive requirements parsing.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The recursive parsing could be a vector for malformed dependencies if inputs are compromised, but no malicious intent or code execution is evident.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — acceptable.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly identifies minimal risk.\n\n**Verdict:** **Appropriate and reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, no malicious behavior, standard setup code.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No untrusted data flow, code execution, or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — suitable.\n- **Conclusion:** Well justified.\n\n**Verdict:** **Accurate.**\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent. No malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, as code is straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** Mostly 0 or 0.1, reflecting minimal or no security risk, which aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n### My Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — due to deprecated `dependency_links`, but not malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent, accurate, and justified based on the code provided.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code is a typical setup script with no security concerns. The minor use of deprecated features warrants a small risk score but does not elevate it to a serious threat.",
