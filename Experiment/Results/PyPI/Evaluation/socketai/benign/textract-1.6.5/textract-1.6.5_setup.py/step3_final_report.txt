  "purpose": "Setup configuration for packaging the Python project, including reading dependencies, scripts, and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading README file, globbing scripts in 'bin/*', parsing requirements files with potential nested includes, and collecting dependency links.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; dependencies are read from static files, and no untrusted data is executed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Input files (README, requirements) are read; dependencies and scripts are collected; setup parameters are configured without dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated 'dependency_links' which could be exploited if external URLs are malicious, but this is a known deprecation issue, not malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with static file reads, globbing for scripts, and dependency parsing. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The recursive parsing of requirements files is typical but could be exploited if malicious files are introduced, though this is external input handling. The use of 'dependency_links' is deprecated but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, well-structured setup configuration with no malicious intent or behavior. The minor concern about 'dependency_links' is a known deprecation issue, not an active security threat. Scores are appropriately low: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.",
