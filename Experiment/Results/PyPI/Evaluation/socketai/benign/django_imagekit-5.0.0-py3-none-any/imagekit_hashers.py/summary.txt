  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for deterministic serialization and hashing of Python objects. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low malware score (0), obfuscated score (0), and minimal security risk (0.1) are justified. Overall, it is a safe, purpose-driven implementation with no malicious intent."
