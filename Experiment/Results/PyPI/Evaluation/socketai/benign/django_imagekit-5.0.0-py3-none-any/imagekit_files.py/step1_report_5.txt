{
  "purpose": "Defines custom file handling classes for use with Django, wrapping storage and ContentFile functionalities.",
  "sources": "Input is from parameters during class instantiation and method calls, notably 'storage', 'filename', 'content', and 'format'.",
  "sinks": "Methods accessing storage (open, path, url, size) and properties (file, name, content_type). No direct untrusted data output or external network calls identified.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (storage, filename, content, format) flow into object properties and methods, with access to storage-related functions and file content handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code uses standard Python and Django patterns. No suspicious data flows or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The classes extend Django's File and ContentFile, adding utility for file properties and MIME type detection. The code handles file opening, closing, and property access in a standard, secure manner. No signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection. The use of storage and file operations appears normal and confined within expected Django file management practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard Django file handling utility classes with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain security issues. It manages file access and MIME type assignment securely without external network interactions or suspicious logic.",
