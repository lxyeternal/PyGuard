  "purpose": "Provides utility classes for managing file storage and content in Django, including MIME type handling and file access.",
  "sources": "Filename, format, and content data used to determine MIME type and access stored files.",
  "sinks": "Storage methods (open, url, path, size) that could leak path or filename information if untrusted input is used without validation.",
  "flows": "Filename and format influence MIME type; filename used in storage access and URL generation; no external network or data exfiltration present.",
  "anomalies": "No malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Potential concern if filename input is unvalidated, but this is typical in file handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of Django file handling utilities, with methods for opening, closing, and retrieving file metadata. MIME type determination is based on filename extension or provided format. No suspicious behaviors, network activity, or malicious logic are present. The only minor security consideration is reliance on filename input, which could be exploited if not validated externally, but this is outside the scope of the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and adheres to standard practices. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The low risk scores are appropriate, primarily noting the potential for filename-based issues if external validation is absent.",
