{
  "purpose": "Defines custom file handling classes for managing file storage, access, and metadata within a Django project.",
  "sources": "Input data includes filename, content, and format parameters in the IKContentFile constructor; file content from ContentFile objects; storage methods for file access.",
  "sinks": "Methods accessing storage (open, path, url, size) could potentially leak file data or expose filesystem paths; no untrusted data sinks in the code itself.",
  "flows": "Input filename and content flow into IKContentFile; filename and format determine MIME type; storage methods access underlying filesystem.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. Code relies on standard Django and Python features. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard file management within a Django context, wrapping ContentFile with added MIME type handling based on extension or provided format. No suspicious or malicious logic present. No external data sources or network communication are involved. Storage access methods appear to be standard Django storage usage, with no indication of malicious activity. The class design focuses on managing file metadata and safe access patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard, well-structured Django file handling code without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It performs file management tasks typical in web applications, with no evidence of malware, malicious data exfiltration, or sabotage.",
