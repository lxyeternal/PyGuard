  "purpose": "Defines custom Django signals for application events related to generated files and source group actions.",
  "sources": "Signals are created but no input or data reading operations are performed.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data transmissions are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources leading to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward signal definitions with no unusual or suspicious code constructs. No hardcoded secrets or hidden behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django's Signal class and defines three signal objects for use within a Django project. No data processing, input handling, or external communication occurs. The code appears to serve as a module for event signaling, typical in Django applications. No obfuscated code, malicious logic, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup for defining custom signals in Django. It does not contain malware or security risks. The overall security risk is minimal, and there is no indication of malicious intent.",
