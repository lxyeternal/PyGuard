  "purpose": "Define Django signals for content requirement, existence requirement, and source saved events.",
  "sources": "Code defines signals using django.dispatch.Signal() - these are standard signal definitions, not external data inputs.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external inputs are processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "N/A - signal definitions are static; no dynamic data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Signal class from django.dispatch and creates three signal instances for different events. These are typical in Django applications for decoupled event handling. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are present. The code appears to be a simple, standard signal declaration without any malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard declaration of Django signals for application event handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
