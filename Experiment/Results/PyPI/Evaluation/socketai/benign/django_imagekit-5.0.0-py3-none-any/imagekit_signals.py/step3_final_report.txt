  "purpose": "Declaration of Django signals for specific events within an application.",
  "sources": "Static import of django.dispatch.Signal; signal definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data input, output, or external communication; no sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; signals are declared but not emitted or connected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django's Signal class and defines three signals without any dynamic data handling, external input, or emission. It is a straightforward, standard pattern for setting up signals in Django applications. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 in one report is slightly overestimated given the static, harmless code, and should be adjusted to 0 for accuracy.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Django signals declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature. The slight elevation in security risk score in one report is unwarranted and should be revised to zero. Overall, the code poses no security threat or malicious activity.",
