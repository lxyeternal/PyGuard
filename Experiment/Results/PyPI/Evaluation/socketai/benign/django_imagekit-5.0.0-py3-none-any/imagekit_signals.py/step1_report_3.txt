  "purpose": "Defines Django signals for application events related to content, existence, and source saving.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines signal objects without reading external input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or stored.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or signal dispatching occurs in this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code appears to be straightforward signal definitions with standard usage.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django's Signal class and creates three signal instances: content_required, existence_required, and source_saved. These are standard patterns for event handling in Django applications. There are no suspicious or unusual constructs, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns. The code is minimal and typical for a Django project setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign setup of Django signals with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It does not perform any data processing, input reading, or external communication.",
