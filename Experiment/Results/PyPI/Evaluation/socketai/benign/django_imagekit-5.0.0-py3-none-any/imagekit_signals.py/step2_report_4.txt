  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is minimal, only defining three Django signals.\n- No external data input, data processing, or signal emission is present.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns, obfuscation, or anomalies are identified.\n- The reports consistently conclude that the code is benign and standard.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues:**  \n   All reports agree that the code only declares signals with no data flow, external inputs, or outputs. There are no issues present in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is straightforward and typical for Django applications. No logical flaws or mistakes are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned:**  \n   - All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n   - The `securityRisk` score in report 4 is 0.1, which seems slightly elevated but still minimal, perhaps indicating a very low potential concern. Given the code's simplicity, this is acceptable but could be considered slightly overcautious.\n   - The `obfuscated` scores are all 0, which is appropriate.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.5. All are at 0 or 0.1, indicating negligible or no risk. This is justified given the code's benign nature.\n\n5. **Malware score justification:**  \n   Since the code only defines signals without any malicious behavior, the malware score should remain at 0 across all reports. No malicious activity is suggested or implied.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions. They correctly state that the code is purely declarative and does not perform any suspicious actions.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis. No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a standard, benign Django pattern for defining signals.\n- No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n- The minor security risk score of 0.1 in report 4 could be slightly reduced to 0 for consistency, but it's not a significant issue.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security concern)\n\n**Final assessment:**  \nThe code is safe, standard, and poses no security or malware risks. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate given the context.",
