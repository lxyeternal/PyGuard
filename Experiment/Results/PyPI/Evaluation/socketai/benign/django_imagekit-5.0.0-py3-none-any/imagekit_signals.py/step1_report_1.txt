{
  "purpose": "Define Django signals for specific events in an application, such as content requirements, existence checks, and source saving.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines signals and does not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or send data to external systems or perform actions that could leak data.",
  "flows": "No data flow is established within this code segment; signals are declared but not emitted or connected.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and uses standard Django signal definitions without any suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django's Signal class and defines three signals related to content requirements, existence checks, and source saving. There are no dynamic code executions, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. It is a typical pattern for setting up event signals in Django applications. Since the code does not include signal emission, listeners, or external data processing, it poses no security risk or malicious behavior. The simplicity and clarity suggest this is a standard implementation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign and standard setup for Django signals with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It merely declares signals for use elsewhere in the application.",
