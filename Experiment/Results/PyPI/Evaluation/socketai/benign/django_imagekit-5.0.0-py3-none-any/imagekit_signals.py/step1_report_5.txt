{
  "purpose": "Define custom Django signals for application events related to content, existence, and source saving.",
  "sources": "The code defines signals, which are triggers for event-driven behavior in Django; no data input or external data reading occurs here.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or handle untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks since the code only declares signals without data handling or processing.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious constructs. The code is straightforward and standard for Django signal definitions.",
  "analysis": "This code simply imports Django's Signal class and creates three signal instances with clear, descriptive names. There is no data processing, no external input handling, and no potentially malicious code. The signals are likely used elsewhere in the application to trigger or listen for specific events.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django pattern for defining signals, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and typical for Django projects.",
