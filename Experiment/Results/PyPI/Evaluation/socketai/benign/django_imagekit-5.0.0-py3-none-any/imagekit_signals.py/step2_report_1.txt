  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Validation**:  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code only defines Django signals without any dynamic data processing, external input, or emission of signals. The code is straightforward and standard.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment that the code is benign and typical for Django applications.  \n- No errors or misconceptions are evident in their reasoning.  \n- They correctly note the absence of suspicious constructs, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior.\n\n3. **Scores Review**:  \n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.  \n- The obfuscated score is 0 across the board, appropriate given the straightforward code.  \n- The security risk scores are mostly 0, with one report assigning 0.1, which seems reasonable as a minimal, theoretical concern but not indicative of actual risk.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:  \n- None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.1, which is appropriate.  \n- Since the code is purely declarative and standard, higher risk scores would be unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Justification**:  \n- All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n- The reports avoid speculative claims; they base their conclusions on the code's static nature and standard patterns.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n- The scores are consistent with the analysis; no adjustments needed.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe code is a standard, benign Django signals declaration with no security issues. The reports' evaluations are accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**My Overall Estimate**:\n\n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the thorough analysis and the nature of the code.",
