  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is straightforward: it imports Django's Signal class and defines three signals.\n- No data is read or written; signals are declared but not emitted or connected.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns, obfuscation, or external data handling are present.\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign and standard.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code matches the original code provided.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected in any report.\n- **Data flow or external interaction:** None, consistent across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** Not present.\n- **Security risk:** Zero or negligible in all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in the reports:\n- The reports are thorough and consistent. They correctly identify that the code is standard, benign, and does not pose security risks.\n- The only minor point is the **securityRisk** score in report 4, which is set to 0.1 despite no suspicious activity. Given the code's simplicity, this seems unjustified. A score of 0 would be more appropriate.\n\n### Scoring analysis:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all reports, correct.\n- **Security risk score:** Mostly 0, except report 4 with 0.1. Since there's no malicious activity, this should be 0.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports suggest any malicious or risky behavior; all scores are 0, which is justified.\n- The only questionable score is the 0.1 in report 4, which should be revised to 0.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The reports do not claim any vulnerabilities, only that the code is standard.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; all claims are based on code analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Scores:** I agree with all reports setting malware and obfuscated scores to 0.\n- **Security risk:** Should be 0 across all reports, including report 4.\n- **Overall assessment:** The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues.\n\n---\n\n### My estimated scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis above.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, benign Django signals setup with no security risks or malicious behavior. The scoring should reflect this, with all scores at zero.",
