  "purpose": "A Django utility class for rendering image thumbnails in the admin interface, fetching image attributes or callables, and rendering a template with the thumbnail data.",
  "sources": "Object attribute specified by 'image_field' or a callable provided during initialization.",
  "sinks": "Rendering context passed to 'render_to_string', which outputs HTML for the admin interface.",
  "flows": "Object attribute or callable -> thumbnail variable -> context passed to 'render_to_string' -> HTML output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity. The template path can be overridden, but this is standard in Django.",
  "analysis": "The code safely accesses object attributes or callables, handles missing attributes with exceptions, and renders a template. No external network calls, data leaks, or malicious patterns are present. The code follows standard Django practices. All signals indicate benign behavior with no malicious intent. The template path is configurable, which is typical and not suspicious. No obfuscation or hardcoded secrets are detected. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to external template override potential, which is common in Django projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Django utility for displaying image thumbnails in the admin interface. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting typical minimal risk associated with external template customization.",
