  "sources": "Input data: 'obj' parameter in __call__, attribute access via self.image_field, optional callable image_field.",
  "sinks": "render_to_string function rendering a template with context data; no untrusted data output or external calls.",
  "flows": "Input data from 'obj' through attribute access or callables, passed into template rendering. No data flows to external or network sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious dynamic code execution, no unusual or obfuscated code. Use of gettext_lazy is standard for translation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for rendering image thumbnails in Django admin. It safely accesses model attributes or callables, and uses Django's render_to_string for templating. No input sanitization issues or malicious code patterns observed. No network calls, file operations, or data exfiltration present. The code appears to be a straightforward utility with no malicious intent or security flaws.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for Django admin interface, with no signs of malware or security risks. It safely renders images based on model attributes and templates without external interactions or sensitive data leaks.",
