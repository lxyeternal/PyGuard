  "purpose": "Django configuration class managing cache and storage settings with validation and fallback defaults.",
  "sources": "Settings such as settings.CACHES, settings.DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE, and imported modules like django.conf and django.core.cache.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is used in a way that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Validation functions check input values and return defaults or raise exceptions; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses standard practices, exception handling, and conditional defaults without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Django configuration class with validation for cache backend names, default storage, and cache timeout. It employs standard exception handling and fallback mechanisms for backward compatibility. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. The validation logic is correct, and no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are detected. The code's benign nature is consistent across multiple reports, and the assigned scores reflect this.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard Django configuration class with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.1, indicating minimal configuration-related risk. The reports' assessments are accurate and justified.",
