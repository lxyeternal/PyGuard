  "purpose": "Configuration class for managing image caching and storage settings in a Django application.",
  "sources": "Reading settings.CACHES, settings.DEBUG, settings.DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE, and importing from django.conf and django.core.cache.",
  "sinks": "Potentially modifying or returning cache configuration values, but no untrusted data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input sources (settings, function parameters) flow into methods that validate or return configuration values; no data flows from untrusted input to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. The code primarily performs configuration validation and default assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a configuration class with methods to determine cache backend, cache timeout, and default file storage. It performs validation against settings and raises exceptions if misconfigured. There are no signs of malicious logic, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection. All operations are standard configuration management without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate configuration class for managing image cache settings in Django. No malicious intent or malicious code is detected. The class performs validation and defaulting of configuration values safely.",
