  "purpose": "Configuration class for managing cache and storage settings in a Django application related to ImageKit.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration values from function parameters (e.g., value), Django settings, and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Returns configuration values and raises ImproperlyConfigured exceptions based on settings and input parameters.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> configuration methods -> return values or raise exceptions; settings and imported modules influence control flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no suspicious or malicious code behaviors detected. Use of try-except for backward compatibility is normal.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a configuration class for an image processing app, with methods to determine cache backend, timeout, and file storage. It reads input parameters and system settings, performs validation, and manages defaults. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or data leaks are present. The try-except block for backward compatibility is standard practice, not malicious. No suspicious anomalies are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate configuration class for managing cache and storage settings in a Django project. No malicious activity, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident. It handles configuration defaults and validation appropriately.",
