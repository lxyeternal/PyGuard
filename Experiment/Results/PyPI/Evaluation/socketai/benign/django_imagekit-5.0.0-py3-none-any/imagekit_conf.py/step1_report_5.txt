  "purpose": "Configuration class for ImageKit settings in a Django project, managing cache and storage options.",
  "sources": "Reads from function parameters (e.g., value) and Django settings (settings.CACHES, settings.DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE, settings.DEBUG).",
  "sinks": "Returns configuration values based on conditions, raises ImproperlyConfigured exception if an invalid cache alias is provided.",
  "flows": "Input parameters or settings determine configuration return values; potential misconfigurations are raised as exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present. The only notable aspect is the exception raising for invalid cache alias, which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a configuration class with methods to set cache backend, cache timeout, and default file storage. It reads from user-provided values, environment variables, and Django settings. The methods include validation and fallback defaults, including raising exceptions for misconfigurations. No data exfiltration, malicious backdoors, or suspicious logic are present. The code appears standard for Django app configuration management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical configuration class managing cache and storage settings with proper validation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It functions as expected for application configuration.",
