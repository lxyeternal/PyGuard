  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions and establish aliases for backwards compatibility within a Python module related to image processing.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; exceptions are defined as part of the code.",
  "sinks": "No data flows from untrusted sources; no sink for data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow pathways as this code only declares exception classes and aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present. The code is straightforward exception class declarations and alias assignments.",
  "analysis": "The code only declares custom exception classes inheriting from built-in or other exceptions, with no complex logic, data handling, or external data access. Aliases are created for compatibility. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, standard, and free of malicious intent. It only defines exception classes and aliases for backwards compatibility. No security issues or malware indications are present.",
