{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom exception classes and creates aliases for backward compatibility within a library, serving error handling purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'pilkit.exceptions' and class definitions for exceptions and aliases.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, input/output, network interactions, or external calls present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only declares classes and aliases without data processing.",
  "anomalies": "None observed; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, malicious code, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from standard exceptions and alias assignments. It imports exceptions from a third-party library and creates aliases for backward compatibility. There are no data flows, input handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns indicate benign intent. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0. The code serves as error handling scaffolding within a larger project, with no vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward set of exception class definitions and aliases, with no security risks or malicious intent. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
