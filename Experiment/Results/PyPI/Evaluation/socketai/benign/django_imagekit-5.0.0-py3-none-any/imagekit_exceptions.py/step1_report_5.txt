  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes and create aliases for backward compatibility within a Python package related to image processing.",
  "sources": "Import statements from pilkit.exceptions",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code does not handle untrusted data or input/output operations",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines classes and aliases",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions and alias assignments",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific exception classes from a third-party library, then defines additional custom exception classes for handling registration and missing data issues. It also creates aliases for backward compatibility. There is no input processing, no data flow, no execution of dynamic code, and no handling of untrusted data. The code's structure is simple and standard, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of class definitions and aliases without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain any malicious behavior or malware indications.",
