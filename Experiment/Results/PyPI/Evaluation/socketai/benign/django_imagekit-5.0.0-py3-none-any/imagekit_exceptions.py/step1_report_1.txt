  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes and aliases related to image format and extension handling in the pilkit library.",
  "sources": "Import statements for exceptions from pilkit.exceptions, and class definitions within the code.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; exception classes are defined but not used in a way that leads to untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input or output; exception classes are standard and only used for error handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines custom exception classes and aliases, which are straightforward and standard. There are no input handling, data processing, or network interactions. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for defining exception classes and aliases for compatibility. It does not contain malicious code or security risks.",
