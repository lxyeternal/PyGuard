  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code solely defines custom exception classes and aliases.\n- There are no data flows involving untrusted input, no input/output operations, no external calls, and no dynamic or obfuscated code.\n- The exception classes are simple, inheriting from standard exceptions, with no additional logic.\n- The aliasing for backward compatibility is straightforward.\n- No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected.\n\n**Scores Evaluation:**\n- Malware score: consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- Obfuscated score: 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- Security risk score: 0, appropriate given the absence of any security-sensitive operations.\n\n**Potential Issues or Concerns:**\n- No issues or suspicious behavior are identified.\n- The reasoning in each report is consistent and justified.\n- The scores are reasonable and align with the code's purpose.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard, harmless set of exception class definitions and aliases.\n- No modifications to scores are necessary.\n- The reports are accurate and comprehensive.\n\n**My Overall Estimate:**\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated score: 0\n- Security risk score: 0\n\n**Final Remarks:**\nThis code snippet is purely for defining exception classes and maintaining backward compatibility. It poses no security risks, malware concerns, or obfuscation issues. The reports correctly reflect this assessment.",
