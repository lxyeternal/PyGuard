  "flows": "No data flow paths from sources to sinks; code only defines exceptions and aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions inheriting from base exceptions and alias assignments. It does not process input, handle external data, or execute dynamic code. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "This is benign code defining exception classes and aliases, with no malicious intent or security risks.",
