  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple exception class definitions and alias assignments.\n- No input/output handling, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.\n- The code is standard, straightforward, and serves error handling purposes within the library.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code as per the reports. The code is purely defining exception classes and aliases.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- **Errors or flaws:** None identified. The reports correctly state that the code is benign and standard.\n\n### Score Justification:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0, justified since there's no data handling, external calls, or dynamic behavior.\n\n### Consistency and Reasonableness:\n- The scores are consistent across reports and reasonable given the code's simplicity.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n### Additional Critical Evaluation:\n- The exception classes inherit from standard exceptions, with no additional logic.\n- Aliases are for backward compatibility, which is common practice.\n- No potential vulnerabilities or malicious patterns are suggested or implied.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is purely for defining exception classes and aliases, with no data flow, external interactions, or suspicious constructs. The reports are accurate, and the scores reflect the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, standard, and contains no security concerns. The scores are appropriate and should remain as they are.",
