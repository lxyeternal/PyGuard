  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions and aliases related to image format and extension handling in the pilkit library.",
  "sources": "Import statement for exceptions from pilkit.exceptions",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no input/output operations, no external calls",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation or dynamic execution",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines custom exception classes and creates aliases for existing exception classes. There are no input/output operations, no data flow from untrusted sources, and no code that could be used maliciously. The exception classes are simple, inheriting from base exception types, with no additional logic. The aliasing of exceptions does not introduce any security risk or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward definition of exception classes and aliases with no suspicious or malicious elements. It serves as part of a larger library's error handling mechanism and poses no security concerns.",
