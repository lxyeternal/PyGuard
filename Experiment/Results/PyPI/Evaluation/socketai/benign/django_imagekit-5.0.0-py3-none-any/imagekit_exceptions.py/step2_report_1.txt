  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as defining custom exception classes and creating aliases for compatibility.\n- No input/output handling, data processing, or network interactions are involved.\n- The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, dynamic execution, or malicious behavior.\n- The exception classes inherit from standard exceptions and are not used in any suspicious context.\n- The aliasing does not introduce security risks.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Confirmed: The code only defines exceptions and aliases.  \n- No errors or flaws.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.  \n- Conclusion: No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Confirmed: Same as above.  \n- No errors or suspicious behavior.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.  \n- Conclusion: No issues.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Confirmed: Straightforward exception class definitions and alias assignments.  \n- No flaws or malicious activity.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.  \n- Conclusion: No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Confirmed: Exception classes and aliases for compatibility.  \n- No data handling or suspicious code.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.  \n- Conclusion: No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Confirmed: Importing exceptions, defining new exceptions, creating aliases.  \n- No malicious or suspicious behavior.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.  \n- Conclusion: No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; malware=0 is justified.\n- **Obfuscated score:** The code is clear and straightforward; obfuscated=0 is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** Given the simplicity and benign nature, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is purely for defining exception classes and creating aliases, serving as part of a larger library's error handling. There are no vulnerabilities, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation concerns.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the reports' conclusions.",
