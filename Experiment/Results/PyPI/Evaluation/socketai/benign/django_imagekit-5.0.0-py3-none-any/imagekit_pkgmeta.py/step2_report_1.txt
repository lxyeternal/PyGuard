  "review": "Let's carefully analyze the reports and the code to ensure consistency and correctness.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   The code is a straightforward set of variable assignments defining package metadata (`__title__`, `__author__`, `__version__`, `__license__`, `__all__`). There are no functions, data flows, external inputs, or dynamic behaviors. All reports correctly identify this as benign, standard boilerplate code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent in their assessment: they recognize that the code only assigns static string values and contains no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs. No errors or logical flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n   - `obfuscated`: 0\n   - `malware`: 0\n   - `securityRisk`: 0\n\n   These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since all reports assign `securityRisk` and `malware` scores of 0, there's no need to adjust. The code does not pose any security risk or malware threat.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is correctly set to 0 across all reports, consistent with the analysis that there's no malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports do not rely on assumptions; they accurately identify the code as standard metadata declarations.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis—no suspicious activity or malware detected.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment\n\n**Based on the code and reports:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is purely static metadata assignment, typical in Python packages, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's benign nature. No adjustments are necessary.",
