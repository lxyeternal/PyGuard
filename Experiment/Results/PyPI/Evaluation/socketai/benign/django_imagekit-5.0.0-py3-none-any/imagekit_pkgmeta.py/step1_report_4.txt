  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'django-imagekit' Python package.",
  "sources": "Module-level variables (__title__, __author__, __version__, __license__).",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flows to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as this is purely metadata declaration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and typical for package metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code declares metadata variables such as title, author, version, and license for the package. All variables are assigned string literals. No external input, no dynamic code execution, no sensitive data, and no malicious constructs detected. The code is minimal and standard for Python package setup files, with no suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign package metadata declaration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
