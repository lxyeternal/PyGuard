  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'django-imagekit' Python package.",
  "sources": "Static string assignments to __title__, __author__, __version__, __license__, and __all__ variables.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data output.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static assignments are independent and do not interact with external sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, with no dynamic code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments providing package metadata. There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or dynamic behaviors. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the code's simplicity and static nature. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are present. The code aligns with standard Python package metadata declarations, and there is no indication of malicious activity or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as standard package metadata. All reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
