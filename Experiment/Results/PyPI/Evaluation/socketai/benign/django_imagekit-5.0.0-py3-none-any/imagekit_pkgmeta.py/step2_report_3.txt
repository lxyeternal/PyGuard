  "review": "Let's carefully analyze each report and the associated code snippet.\n\n**Code Review:**\nThe code simply assigns static string values to module-level variables (__title__, __author__, __version__, __license__, __all__). There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or dynamic behaviors. This pattern is standard in Python packages for metadata declaration.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Findings:\n- **Presence of issues:** No. The code is straightforward, with no malicious or suspicious constructs.\n- **Malware:** Zero. No malicious code, no external data, no code execution.\n- **Obfuscation:** Zero. The code is clear and readable.\n- **Security Risk:** Zero. No vulnerabilities, no secrets, no external interactions.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All describe the code as simple metadata declarations.\n- No anomalies, no suspicious patterns.\n- The reasoning is consistent and accurate.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified.\n- The confidence score of 1 is reasonable given the clarity and simplicity.\n\n**Potential issues or discrepancies:**\n- None. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n- Since all reports agree on the benign nature, and the code is indeed just static assignments, there's no reason to adjust scores.\n- The malware score should remain 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score should remain 0, as the code is transparent.\n- The security risk score should remain 0, as there's no security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Overall malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese align with the evidence and analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is purely metadata declaration with no malicious or suspicious content. All reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary. The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis assessment confirms the code's benign nature and lack of security concerns.",
