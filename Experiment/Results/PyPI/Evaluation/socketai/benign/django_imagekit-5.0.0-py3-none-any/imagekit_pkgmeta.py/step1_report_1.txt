  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'django-imagekit' library, including title, author, version, license, and exported symbols.",
  "sources": "Constants assigned with string values for package metadata (__title__, __author__, __version__, __license__, __all__).",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code only assigns metadata strings to variables.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static assignments only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward assignment of metadata. No hidden code, no dynamic execution, no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple declaration of package metadata variables. No input reading, no untrusted data processing, no code execution, and no external data handling. It contains only static string assignments that are typical in Python packages for metadata purposes. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving only to define package metadata with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
