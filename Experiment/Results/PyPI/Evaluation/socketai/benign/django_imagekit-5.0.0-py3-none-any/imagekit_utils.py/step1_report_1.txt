  "purpose": "Utility functions for dynamic module import, class singleton management, autodiscovery of modules, logging, and cache key sanitization within a Django application, particularly related to image processing.",
  "sources": "Gets data from module paths, class definitions, environment settings, and cache keys. Uses dynamic imports and getattr to retrieve modules, classes, and methods. Reads configuration settings from Django settings.",
  "sinks": "Potentially dynamic attribute access with getattr, which could be manipulated if inputs are untrusted (though in this code, inputs are from trusted settings). No explicit data sinks such as database or network connections are present. Cache key sanitization could be a vector if key manipulation is malicious, but it's limited to string sanitization.",
  "flows": "Input from settings or parameters flows into dynamic import or attribute access, then into cache key sanitization functions or singleton creation. No external untrusted data flows directly into security-critical operations like network or database access.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically imports modules and classes, which could be risky if input paths are manipulated. The use of 'import_module' and 'getattr' with potentially untrusted inputs is a point of concern, but in typical Django settings, these are controlled. The cache key sanitization employs regex to remove control characters, which is standard. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code constructs are detected. The code appears standard for plugin registration and configuration management.",
  "analysis": "The code is mainly utility and setup functions for a Django project. It uses dynamic importing and singleton patterns, with mechanisms for auto-discovery and cache key sanitization. The use of 'import_module' and 'getattr' could be misused if external inputs are compromised, but in this context, they are based on predefined paths and settings. The cache key sanitization aims to prevent injection-like issues with Memcached. No malware behaviors, such as network exfiltration or file manipulation, are present. The code structure and functions are typical for plugin and resource management, with no obfuscated or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard utility code for a Django project with dynamic module loading, singleton pattern, and cache sanitization. No malicious behavior or malware is evident. The only minor concern is reliance on settings-based inputs for dynamic imports, but this is typical and controlled within a Django environment. Overall, the code appears safe and free from security threats.",
