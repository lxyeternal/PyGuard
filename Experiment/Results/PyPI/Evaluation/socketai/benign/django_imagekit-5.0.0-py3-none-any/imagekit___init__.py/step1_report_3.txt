  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a package's __init__.py file, mainly for importing and exposing various modules and symbols for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: conf, generatorlibrary, pkgmeta, registry, specs",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed; only module imports and exports",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; mainly static imports and symbol exports",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code is straightforward and standard for a Python package __init__.py",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package initialization tasks by importing modules and symbols, then defining __all__ for export. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is simple and conventional, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package initialization script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It simply sets up module exports and imports internal components.",
