{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initializer, importing internal modules and defining the public API surface via __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.conf, .generatorlibrary, .pkgmeta, .registry, .specs).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static import statements only.",
  "flows": "N/A - static imports without data flow or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from .pkgmeta import *' could cause namespace pollution but is common in package init files; no malicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward __init__.py file, importing internal modules and exposing symbols. No dynamic code, network activity, or user input handling. The wildcard import is a minor concern but not security-related. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and static nature support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package initializer with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.1, reflecting minimal concern primarily due to namespace pollution potential but not actual threat.",
