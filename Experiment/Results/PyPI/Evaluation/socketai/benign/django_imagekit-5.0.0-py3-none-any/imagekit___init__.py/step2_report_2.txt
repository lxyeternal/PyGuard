  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate these reports:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward `__init__.py`-style module, primarily performing imports and defining `__all__`. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behavior in the provided snippet. The code is standard for package initialization.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.  \n   - They correctly note the use of relative imports, wildcard imports, and the absence of dynamic or external data processing.  \n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident in the analysis.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.  \n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, which is appropriate given the code clarity.  \n   - Security risk scores are low (mostly 0 or 0.1), reflecting minimal concern.  \n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 1.0 or 0.9), consistent with the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:  \n   - None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5, which is appropriate given the code's benign nature.  \n   - The only slightly elevated score (0.1) is justified as a conservative measure, considering that the actual risk depends on the contents of the imported modules, which are not provided.\n\n5. **Malware Score Justification**:  \n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, consistent with the absence of malicious code in this snippet.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they focus on static analysis of the code snippet.  \n   - They acknowledge that the imported modules could contain risks but do not speculate beyond the provided code.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's nature.\n\n**Overall Evaluation and Recommendations**:\n\n- The code is a typical package initializer with no malicious or suspicious features.  \n- The reports are thorough, accurate, and appropriately cautious without overestimating risk.  \n- Since the actual imported modules are not examined, the risk assessments appropriately reflect that limitation.\n\n**Final Estimated Scores**:\n\n- **Malware**: 0 (no evidence of malicious activity)  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0 (clear code)  \n- **Risk**: 0.1 (very low, conservative estimate considering potential risks in imported modules)\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe code is safe, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and align with the analysis. No changes are necessary.",
