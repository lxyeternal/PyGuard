  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no data processing or external outputs shown",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; only internal imports and symbol exports",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative imports is normal; no hardcoded secrets, suspicious patterns, or unusual code structures observed",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of import statements, __all__ declaration, and module metadata exports. There is no evidence of data leaks, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. The imported modules might contain risks, but based solely on this snippet, no malicious intent or security issues are apparent. The structure is straightforward and typical for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard package initializer, importing local modules and defining exports. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected based on this snippet.",
