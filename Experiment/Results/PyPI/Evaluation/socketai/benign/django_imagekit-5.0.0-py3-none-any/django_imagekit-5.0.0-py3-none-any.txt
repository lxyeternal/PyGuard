      "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of Django utility functions with no malicious intent or malware detected. The primary concern is the dynamic method invocation, which could be a vector if misused, but in controlled environments, it remains safe. The scores reflect low risk and no malware, with a slight caution due to dynamic attribute access. Overall, the supply chain security posture is strong, with no immediate threats."
