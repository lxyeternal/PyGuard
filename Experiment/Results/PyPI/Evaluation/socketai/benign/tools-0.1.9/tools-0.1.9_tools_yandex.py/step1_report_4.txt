{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to build search URLs for Yandex, parse search results pages, and detect if a page is banned or shows a captcha.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'query' in 'build_search_url', data fetched via 'grab' object (HTML content), and URL parameters in 'kwargs'.",
  "sinks": "None of the sinks directly process untrusted data into dangerous system actions; URL construction and parsing are performed safely, no data leaks or dangerous commands are evident.",
  "flows": "Input 'query' -> 'build_search_url' constructs URL; 'grab' fetches page -> 'parse_search_results' extracts data; 'is_banned' detects ban conditions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious patterns detected; commented-out code and placeholder comments do not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The script builds search URLs with user input, processes HTML content to extract search results, and checks for bans or errors. Use of 'smart_str' and 'quote' for URL encoding is standard. No malicious network activity or code injection vulnerabilities are present. The code relies on the 'grab' object for fetching data, which is assumed to be secure. No suspicious obfuscation or malware code is detected. Logging is used for debugging; no dangerous operations are performed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, non-malicious search result parser for Yandex. It performs URL construction and HTML parsing without any indication of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data handling. No security risks or malware behaviors are evident.",
