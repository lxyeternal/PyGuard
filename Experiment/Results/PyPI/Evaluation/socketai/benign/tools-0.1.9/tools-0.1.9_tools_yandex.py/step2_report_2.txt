  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- The code is a web scraper for Yandex search results.\n- It constructs URLs, fetches pages via 'grab', parses results, and detects captchas/bans.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.\n- Use of standard libraries and techniques.\n- No suspicious network activity or data exfiltration.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Correctly describes URL building, parsing, captcha detection.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Accurate.\n- **Anomalies:** No issues, mentions standard practices.\n- **Analysis:** No malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** The code appears legitimate.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)\n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n  - Risk: 0.2 (reasonable, low risk)\n  \n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing URL building, parsing, captcha detection.\n- No suspicious behavior or code.\n- Scores:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Risk: 0.2\n  \n**Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3:**\n- Focuses on URL building, parsing, error detection.\n- No malicious behavior detected.\n- Scores:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Risk: 0.2\n  \n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4:**\n- Highlights URL construction, parsing, and ban detection.\n- No malicious activity.\n- Scores:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Risk: 0.2\n  \n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5:**\n- Notes the presence of commented-out code and debugging print statements.\n- These are benign and common in development; they don't indicate malicious intent.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security issues.\n- Scores:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Risk: 0.2\n  \n**Verdict:** The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, consistent with the code's behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above 0.1, at 0.2, which is reasonable given the code's purpose and lack of malicious behavior.\n\n**Potential Adjustments:**\n- The risk score could be marginally increased to 0.3 if considering the possibility of misuse (e.g., scraping). However, since no malicious intent or vulnerabilities are present, 0.2 remains appropriate.\n- Malware and obfuscation scores are correctly assigned.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendation:**\n\n- **Scores:** Keep as is:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Risk: 0.2\n\n- **Justification:** The code is a standard, benign web scraper with no indicators of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low risk score appropriately reflects minimal security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are consistent with the code's behavior. No changes are necessary. The overall security posture of this code is benign.",
