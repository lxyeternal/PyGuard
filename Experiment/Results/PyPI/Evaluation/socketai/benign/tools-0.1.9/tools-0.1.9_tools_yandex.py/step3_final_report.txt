{
  "purpose": "Builds Yandex search URLs, fetches search result pages, parses results, and detects captchas or bans.",
  "sources": "Query parameters, URL encoding, XPath extraction from HTML content",
  "sinks": "None directly; data is processed internally, no external network or file writes observed",
  "flows": "Input query -> URL construction -> fetch page -> parse HTML -> extract results or detect captcha",
  "anomalies": "Presence of commented-out code, debug print statements ('parsing error'), incomplete features (e.g., commented URL parsing), no malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard web scraping tasks with URL encoding, XPath parsing, and error handling. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. Minor artifacts like print statements and commented code are typical during development and do not indicate malicious intent. The functions are straightforward, and no suspicious network activity or data exfiltration is evident. The exception handling in 'is_last_page' may be slightly fragile but does not impact security. Overall, the code is benign and aligns with typical scraping utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation for Yandex search result scraping. No malicious, obfuscated, or high-risk behaviors are present. The current malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate given minor debugging artifacts. The code's behavior is safe and does not pose security concerns.",
