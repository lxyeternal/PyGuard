{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to build, fetch, and parse Yandex search result pages, handling captchas and errors.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include user-provided search query parameters, and fetched web pages via grab object.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are URL construction (for search queries), extraction of URLs and snippets from search results, and page navigation checks.",
  "flows": "Input query parameters are used to construct search URLs; fetched pages are parsed for results and navigation links; data from pages is extracted and returned as results.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code structures detected. Usage of exception handling appears standard. No suspicious URL or command injection points identified.",
  "analysis": "The script constructs search URLs with proper escaping, fetches search result pages, and parses content for search results and pagination. It includes error handling for captchas and format errors. The functions operate on external input (queries, page data) and extract specific page elements. There are commented-out sections indicating possible future extensions but no active code with malicious intent. No suspicious data leaks or code injections are present. Use of urllib.quote and urllib.parse.quote is standard for URL encoding. The code handles exceptions properly and does not perform any network or system modifications beyond data parsing and URL generation.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate web search URL building and parsing functions. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or security risks are detected. It appears to be a standard, benign web scraping utility for Yandex search results.",
