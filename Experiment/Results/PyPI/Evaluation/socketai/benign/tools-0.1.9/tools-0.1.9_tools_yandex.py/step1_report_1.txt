{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to build, parse, and handle Yandex search result pages, including detecting captchas and errors.",
  "sources": "User input: 'query' parameter in build_search_url, webpage content via 'grab' object, environment variables indirectly through imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable code execution points include URL construction with 'kwargs', and processing of data extracted from web pages, but no direct sinks for untrusted data are evident.",
  "flows": "Input query flows into URL construction; 'grab' object provides page content; data is extracted from HTML elements; no untrusted data is written to files or network directly.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; use of deprecated 'urllib.quote' with fallback; no obfuscated code; logging usage is standard; no suspicious code structures or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard URL encoding, page content parsing, and error handling. Functions like 'is_banned' check for captcha presence, which is typical. Parsing functions extract titles, URLs, and snippets from search result pages. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious data handling observed. No suspicious network activity, hidden backdoors, or data theft mechanisms. Use of 'try-except' blocks for error handling appears appropriate. No obfuscation or malware indicators detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate implementation for parsing Yandex search results. It does not contain malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or security vulnerabilities that could be exploited. It operates with standard web scraping techniques and error handling. Overall, the code is safe from a supply chain security perspective.",
