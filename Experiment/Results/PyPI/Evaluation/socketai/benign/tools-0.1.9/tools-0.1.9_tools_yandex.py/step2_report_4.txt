  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and compare their assessments with the code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Purpose: Build Yandex search URLs, fetch pages, parse results, detect captchas/bans.\n- Key functions: `build_search_url`, `parse_search_results`, `is_banned`, `is_last_page`.\n- Operations: URL encoding, XPath parsing, error handling, no evident malicious behavior.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code detected.\n- Uses standard libraries and techniques.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n- **URL encoding**: Uses `urllib.quote` with fallback to `urllib.parse.quote`. This is standard but slightly outdated; no security concern.\n- **Parsing logic**: Uses XPath to extract data, which appears correct.\n- **Error handling**: Proper try-except blocks.\n- **Potential minor concern**:\n  - The `print('parsing error')` in `parse_search_results` is a debugging leftover, not a security issue.\n  - Commented-out code and debugging `print` statements suggest incomplete production readiness but not malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nNo actual vulnerabilities or malicious code are present in the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Claims:** No malware, obfuscation, or security risk; code is legitimate.\n- **Score:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2.  \n**Assessment:** Accurate. The low risk score is justified given the code's benign nature.\n\n#### Report 2:\n- **Claims:** Similar to Report 1, no malicious activity, standard URL building and parsing.\n- **Score:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2.  \n**Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n#### Report 3:\n- **Claims:** Same as above; legitimate scraper, no malicious behavior.\n- **Score:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2.  \n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n#### Report 4:\n- **Claims:** Same as above; standard URL and HTML parsing, no malicious activity.\n- **Score:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2.  \n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n#### Report 5:\n- **Claims:** Same as above; notes the debugging print statement but no malicious intent.\n- **Score:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2.  \n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is appropriate; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 is justified for the debugging print statement and commented code, indicating minor non-security concerns but nothing serious.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to minor debugging artifacts and incomplete code comments, not security issues)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign web scraper for Yandex search results with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk. The scores assigned by the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways ensure debugging statements like `print()` are removed or replaced with proper logging in production to avoid information leaks or clutter.",
