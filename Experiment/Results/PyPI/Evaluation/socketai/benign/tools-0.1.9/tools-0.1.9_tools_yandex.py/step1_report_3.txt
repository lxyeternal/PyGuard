{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to build Yandex search URLs, fetch and parse search result pages, detect captchas and errors, and extract search result data.",
  "sources": "Input sources include function parameters such as 'query', 'page', 'per_page', 'lang', 'region', and data obtained from HTTP responses via 'grab' object (e.g., XPath queries).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include URL construction with user input, XPath evaluations on fetched HTML content, and logging functions.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., 'query', 'kwargs') flows into URL construction; the 'grab' object fetches pages; XPath results are processed to identify errors, captchas, or parse search results; errors and captchas trigger exceptions; parsed data is returned.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The URL construction uses user input but is straightforward. Error handling is standard. No hidden or malicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs URL building, fetches pages, and parses HTML using XPath, which are typical behaviors for a web scraper. It includes error and captcha detection, raising exceptions accordingly. No suspicious data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious logic detected. Usage of 'grab' for fetching data and XPath for parsing are standard. No obfuscated or malicious code structures are present. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate search result parser with no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard web scraping utility for Yandex search results, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It performs URL construction, page fetching, and HTML parsing in a typical manner without any suspicious or malicious logic.",
