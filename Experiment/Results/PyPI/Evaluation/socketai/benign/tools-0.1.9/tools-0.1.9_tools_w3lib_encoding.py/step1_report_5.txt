  "purpose": "Functions for handling encoding of web pages, including detection and conversion of character encodings from HTTP headers, HTML meta tags, BOMs, and auto-detection.",
  "sources": "HTTP Content-Type header, HTML body meta tags, BOM in data, optional auto-detection function parameter.",
  "sinks": "Encoding lookup via codecs.lookup, string decoding with 'w3lib_replace' error handler.",
  "flows": "Input data from HTTP headers or HTML content is processed through detection functions, encoding is resolved, and data is decoded into Unicode.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs encoding normalization, but no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. It uses a custom error handler for decoding which is standard for handling malformed utf-8 strings.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation for encoding detection and decoding in web content processing. It correctly uses regex to parse headers and meta tags, normalizes encoding names, and handles BOM detection. The decoding function uses a safe fallback error handler. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code are present. The functions are focused solely on encoding detection and conversion without any suspicious side effects or network operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical utility for handling text encoding in web scraping or processing, with no indications of malicious intent or supply chain attacks. It properly manages encodings and decodes data safely, with no suspicious behavior or backdoors identified.",
