  "anomalies": "Code is very minimal; no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code only sets a module-level variable '__version__' to '0.1.9', which is a common practice for versioning Python packages. No malicious code, data leakage, or suspicious behavior is present. The simplicity suggests no hidden functionality or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving solely to specify the package version. No security concerns or malicious intent detected.",
