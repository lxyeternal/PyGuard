  "purpose": "Assign a version string to the __version__ variable in a Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it is a static assignment.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or sinks; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple assignment of a string to __version__, a common pattern in Python packages. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features. No external data sources, inputs, or outputs are involved, and there are no data flows or anomalies. The assessments are accurate and justified based on the code content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action or concern is necessary.",
