{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for slugifying strings and parsing Russian month names, including transliteration and normalization.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions: 'value', 'limit', 'default', 'lower', 'dot_allowed', and 'val'.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes data to external systems or uses untrusted output sinks directly; it processes input data internally.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are sanitized and transformed through regex substitutions and transliteration functions, with no external data outputs or commands executed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The regex patterns are standard for input cleaning. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs input sanitization, transliteration, and parsing of month names. Regex patterns are used to replace disallowed characters, and translify converts Cyrillic to Latin script. The functions handle errors explicitly and do not invoke external commands or insecure operations. No signs of malicious behavior or malware are present. The functions operate solely on input parameters and internal constants. No external data flows or potential data leaks identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for string normalization and parsing. There are no indicators of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe for use within its described functionality.",
