{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for string manipulation, transliteration, and parsing Russian month names.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function parameters: 'value' in 'slugify' and 'val' in 'parse_ru_month'.",
  "sinks": "Data is processed internally; no external data sinks such as network, file, or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through regex substitutions, transliteration, and string manipulation functions within 'slugify' and 'parse_ru_month'.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code performs straightforward string processing and lookup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'translify' for transliteration and 'smart_unicode' for string normalization. It defines regex patterns for sanitizing strings. The 'slugify' function replaces non-allowed characters, transliterates, and normalizes the string, optionally limiting length and converting to lowercase. The 'parse_ru_month' function matches input strings against predefined Russian month name lists, raising an exception if no match is found. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious external interactions. The code appears to be standard utility functions with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of safe string manipulation utilities with no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is well-structured, uses standard libraries, and does not perform any network or system modifications.",
