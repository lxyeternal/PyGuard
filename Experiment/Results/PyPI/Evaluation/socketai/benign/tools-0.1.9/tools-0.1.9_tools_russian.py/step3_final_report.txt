  "purpose": "Utility functions for slugifying strings and parsing Russian month names, involving regex sanitization, transliteration, and lookup.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for functions; external modules 'pytils.translit.translify' and 'tools.encoding.smart_unicode'.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network, or file operations; data flows through regex substitutions, transliteration, and lookups.",
  "flows": "Input strings -> regex sanitization -> translify -> further regex replacements -> return or exception.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard string sanitization and parsing tasks with external libraries for transliteration and normalization. Regex patterns are typical; exception handling is straightforward. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or vulnerabilities. External dependencies are common and safe. No obfuscation or code injection present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for data normalization and parsing, with no malicious intent or security risks. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.2 are appropriate; however, given the benign nature, risk can be conservatively set to 0.",
