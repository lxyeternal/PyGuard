  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for sanitizing and normalizing strings into URL-friendly slugs and for parsing Russian month names into indices.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function parameters: 'value' in 'slugify', and 'val' in 'parse_ru_month'. No external data sources or environment variables are accessed.",
  "sinks": "The functions process data and return sanitized strings or integer indices. No data is written to external systems, files, or network connections.",
  "flows": "Input strings flow through regex substitutions, transliteration, and string manipulations in 'slugify', and through lookup and exception handling in 'parse_ru_month'. No untrusted data is used to influence system behavior beyond string processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. Regex patterns are standard for string sanitation. No hardcoded credentials or hidden behaviors. The translify function's implementation is external and not provided, but its usage appears standard. Exception class 'InvalidMonthName' is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code performs string sanitization, transliteration, and month name parsing using well-defined regex patterns and lookups. It includes exception handling for invalid month names, which is standard. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or hidden network activity are present. External library 'pytils.translit' is used, but it is common for transliteration tasks. There are no dangerous file or network operations, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, focused on string normalization and parsing tasks. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The functions are safe, with clear and intended purpose. Overall, low security risk.",
