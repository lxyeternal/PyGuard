  "purpose": "Utility functions for string sanitization, transliteration, and parsing Russian month names.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions (e.g., 'value' in slugify, 'val' in parse_ru_month).",
  "sinks": "Return statements producing sanitized strings or parsed indices; no direct data sinks for untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> processing steps (regex substitution, transliteration, parsing) -> output values.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. Usage of external library 'pytils.translit' is standard for transliteration; no unsafe code practices evident.",
  "analysis": "The code performs string sanitization, transliteration, and parsing with regex and external library functions. It includes exception handling for invalid month names. No data leaks, network operations, or code injection mechanisms are present. External library usage is normal and controlled. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily for string processing and data validation without malicious intent. It appears to be a legitimate utility module. No malware behavior detected. Security risks are minimal, related only to input validation which is appropriate.",
