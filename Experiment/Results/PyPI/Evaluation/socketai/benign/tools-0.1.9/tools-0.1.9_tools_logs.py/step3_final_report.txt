  "purpose": "Configure logging for network and application logs with optional file handlers and propagation settings.",
  "sources": "Function parameters for log file paths, logging configuration calls, and logger creation.",
  "sinks": "Log messages written to specified log files; no untrusted data flows detected.",
  "flows": "Parameters and logger setup lead to log entries being written to fixed file paths.",
  "anomalies": "Inactive commented-out code related to custom memory handlers and decorators; no active malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward logging configuration function that sets up loggers with file handlers and levels based on parameters. No untrusted input is processed; default paths are fixed. Commented code is inactive and does not influence current behavior. No network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration is present. The code's simplicity and fixed paths indicate benign intent. The commented sections are legacy or experimental and do not pose risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard logging setup with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores in the reports are justified and appropriate.",
