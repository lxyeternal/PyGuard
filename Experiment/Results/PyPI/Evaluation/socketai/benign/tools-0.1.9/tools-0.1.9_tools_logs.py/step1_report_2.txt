  "purpose": "Configure and customize logging output for the application, especially for the 'grab' and 'grab.network' loggers.",
  "sources": "Input sources include default_log and network_log file paths for logging handlers.",
  "sinks": "Logging handlers write to specified log files; no untrusted input or output streams are directly involved in data leaks.",
  "flows": "Logging setup flows from function parameters to logger configurations and file handlers, with no untrusted data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code related to memory logging and global state manipulation is present but inactive; no suspicious or malicious code is active.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up logging configurations with parameters controlling log file destinations, levels, and propagation. No input reading beyond function parameters occurs. No dangerous data flow or security risks identified. Commented code suggests previous experimentation or future features but is inactive. No code injections, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard logging configuration setup without malicious intent or security risks. It appears benign and intended solely for log management.",
