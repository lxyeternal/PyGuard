  "purpose": "Utility functions for controlling execution flow, including sleeping for a random interval and retrying functions with error handling.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include function arguments and exception objects during retries.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data could be logged in exceptions or error messages; sleep times are derived from input limits but do not leak data directly.",
  "flows": "Input limits influence sleep durations; function retries handle exceptions, with potential error logging but no external data flow or exfiltration observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; the sleep function's use of random delays is standard for avoiding detection or throttling. The retry function employs common error handling without malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code provides helper functions for randomized sleeping and function retries with exception handling. The sleep function converts float limits to milliseconds for randint, then sleeps for a random interval, which is common in rate-limiting or avoiding detection. The repeat function retries execution, logging errors, and handles specific exception types. No obfuscated code, malicious instructions, or suspicious patterns are present. There are no signs of data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious side effects. Usage of logging is standard, and no external network or system manipulation occurs.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be benign utility functions used for controlling execution timing and retries. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks in this fragment.",
