  "flows": "N/A - straightforward package setup without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is standard and unremarkable.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with no suspicious or malicious elements. All reports are empty, providing no evidence of vulnerabilities, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The code structure is clear, dependencies are standard, and there are no hidden or suspicious patterns. Given the lack of any detailed reports or findings, the risk and malware scores should be zero, and obfuscation is not present.",
  "conclusion": "The package appears benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues based on the provided code and empty reports. The current scores of malware, obfuscated, and risk are appropriate and should remain at zero.",
