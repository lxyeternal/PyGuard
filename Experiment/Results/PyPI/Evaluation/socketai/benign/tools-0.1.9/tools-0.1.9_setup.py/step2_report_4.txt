  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review:**\n\n- The code is a standard `setup.py` script for packaging a Python project.\n- It specifies dependencies (`pytils`, `six`, `lxml`) and metadata.\n- No apparent malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious logic is present.\n- The code appears to be straightforward and adheres to common packaging practices.\n\n2. **Reports Analysis:**\n\n- All reports are empty responses with \"Empty response\" errors.\n- No actual details or findings are provided in any of the reports.\n- Without additional information, it's impossible to identify specific issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious activity.\n\n3. **Logical and Reasoning Checks:**\n\n- Since reports contain no content, there are no claims or assumptions to evaluate.\n- No errors, flaws, or mistakes are indicated in the reports.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or risky behavior is presented.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n\n- Given the lack of information, any scores assigned would be purely speculative.\n- The malware score should be 0 unless evidence suggests malicious intent.\n- The obfuscated score should be 0 in the absence of obfuscation.\n- The risk score should be minimal, likely 0, unless further details reveal issues.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- Based on the available data, the package appears benign.\n- The absence of detailed reports prevents identifying any hidden issues.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\n\nWithout additional details, there is no evidence to suggest malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant risk. The code is standard packaging code, and the reports are empty. If further information becomes available, a more thorough review should be conducted.",
