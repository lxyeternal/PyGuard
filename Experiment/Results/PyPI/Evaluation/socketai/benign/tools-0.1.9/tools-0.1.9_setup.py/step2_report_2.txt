  "review": "Let's analyze the situation carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The provided code appears to be a standard `setup.py` configuration for a Python package named \"tools\". It includes typical fields such as name, version, description, author info, dependencies, and classifiers.\n   - There are no apparent malicious or suspicious elements in this code snippet.\n   - Without additional context or a specific report, there is no evidence of embedded malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n\n2. **Review of the reports:**\n   - All five reports contain only the message \"Empty response\" with no raw response or detailed analysis.\n   - This indicates that no specific issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors were reported or identified.\n\n3. **Assessment of scores and potential risks:**\n   - Since no issues are reported, the malware score should be 0.\n   - The obfuscated score should also be 0, as there is no indication of code obfuscation.\n   - The risk score should be minimal, ideally 0, given the lack of any reported problems.\n\n4. **Logical considerations:**\n   - The absence of detailed reports or evidence makes it impossible to justify higher scores.\n   - Any assumptions about vulnerabilities or malware without evidence would be unwarranted.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Based on the provided code and the reports, there are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant risk.\n- The scores should all be set to 0, reflecting the absence of issues.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Malware score: **0**\n- Obfuscated score: **0**\n- Risk score: **0**\n\nThis is a conservative and justified assessment given the available information.",
