  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the correctness of the findings, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward HTML content extractor, utilizing standard libraries (`lxml`) and regex for cleaning.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are evident.\n- The functions perform typical content filtering: removing scripts, styles, comments, links, media, and inline tags.\n- The `_trash_ratio` heuristic counts specific punctuation characters, which is benign.\n- No external data sinks or network activity are present.\n- The code appears to serve a content extraction purpose, with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states the code is safe, with no malicious behavior, and the analysis aligns with the code's purpose.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `securityRisk=0`\n- **Justification:** The reasoning is sound; no issues detected.\n- **Assessment:** **Accurate and reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, confirms benign behavior, standard HTML cleaning, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Same as above, all zero.\n- **Justification:** The detailed analysis supports the conclusion.\n- **Assessment:** **Appropriate and consistent.**\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, confirms benign, standard processing with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** All zero, very low risk.\n- **Justification:** The reasoning matches the code's behavior.\n- **Assessment:** **Reasonable and justified.**\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as previous, benign HTML parsing and filtering.\n- **Scores:** All zero, risk very low.\n- **Justification:** Well-founded based on the code.\n- **Assessment:** **Appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar conclusion—benign content extraction, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `securityRisk=0.1`\n- **Justification:** Slightly higher security risk score (0.1) possibly due to mention of regex operations and normalization, but these are standard and benign.\n- **Assessment:** The small `securityRisk=0.1` seems acceptable given the benign nature, but perhaps slightly overestimating. Still, it’s not unreasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior (`0`).\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation (`0`).\n- **Security risk score:** Very low across all reports, justified by the benign, standard processing.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\nGiven the detailed reasoning and the code's straightforward nature, I would assign:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** **0.05 to 0.1** (very low, mainly due to regex and normalization, but these are standard techniques)\n\n**Final note:** The scores given in the reports are consistent with the code's behavior. No anomalies, malicious intent, or obfuscation are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate. The code is a benign HTML content extractor with no security concerns. The scores are justified and aligned with the analysis.",
