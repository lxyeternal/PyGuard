{
  "purpose": "The code processes an HTML DOM tree to extract content blocks after removing certain tags and comments, normalizing the text, and filtering based on content quality.",
  "sources": "Input DOM tree (parameter 'tree') and text data extracted from the processed HTML content.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any external data sinks such as network transmission, file writing, or system commands. It only processes and returns text blocks.",
  "flows": "The code deep copies the DOM tree, removes specific tags and comments, converts the tree to string, normalizes space, strips HTML tags, and then extracts text blocks based on length and trash ratio.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code performs straightforward HTML parsing and text filtering with no obfuscated code or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard Python libraries and well-known third-party libraries (lxml) for HTML parsing. It filters and normalizes text data without any network activity, file system manipulation, or execution of untrusted code. The functions are designed to extract content blocks from HTML documents, possibly for further analysis. No anomalies or malicious intent are detected. The '_trash_ratio' function computes a ratio of special characters, but this is a benign heuristic for content filtering. Overall, the code appears to serve a content extraction purpose with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, legitimate content processing script with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It performs standard HTML manipulation and text filtering without any external communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors.",
