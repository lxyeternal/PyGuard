{
  "purpose": "The code processes an HTML DOM tree to extract content blocks by removing specific tags and comments, normalizing spaces, and filtering based on content quality.",
  "sources": "Reads input from an lxml HTML DOM tree, and the string representation of the DOM after modifications.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or outputs untrusted data to external sources; it only processes and returns data internally.",
  "flows": "Input DOM -> deepcopy -> remove tags/comments/media -> serialize to string -> normalize spaces -> remove all tags -> find text blocks -> filter blocks -> return blocks",
  "anomalies": "Uses regex to remove all HTML tags and extract text blocks; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present; commented-out logging code is harmless; no suspicious URL or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The script imports HTML parsing and text processing libraries and defines functions to extract content blocks from an HTML document. It deep copies the input DOM to avoid external effects, then removes non-data tags ('head', 'style', 'script'), comments, links, inline formatting tags, and media tags ('img'). The resulting DOM is serialized to a string, normalized, and all HTML tags are stripped via regex. It then identifies text blocks via regex matching non-tag characters, filters blocks based on length and trash ratio (non-common symbols), and excludes blocks with very long words. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, file access, or obfuscated code. The code appears to be a straightforward content extraction utility for HTML documents.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs benign HTML content extraction and filtering without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not interact with external systems or contain hidden functionalities. No malware or security risks are evident.",
