  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code processes HTML DOM trees to extract content blocks, removing tags, comments, links, media, normalizing spaces, and filtering based on length and trash ratio.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious or malicious code detected. The functions are straightforward, using standard libraries. The '_trash_ratio' heuristic is benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent with the analysis.\n- **Assessment:** Fully benign, standard content extraction code.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with detailed flow description. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors. Uses regex to strip tags, which is common in such scripts.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, no backdoors.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Safe, straightforward content extraction.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Same core logic, with emphasis on cleaning and filtering HTML content. The '_trash_ratio' heuristic is benign.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious behavior, no external communication, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — justified.\n- **Assessment:** Clearly benign.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar process, standard DOM cleaning, regex stripping, and filtering.\n- **Findings:** No malicious intent, no obfuscation, no external data leaks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n- **Assessment:** Safe.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same pattern; no suspicious behaviors, standard processing.\n- **Findings:** No malware, no obfuscation, only a very low security risk (0.1) possibly due to the regex replacement step, but this is benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — acceptable.\n- **Assessment:** Still safe, with negligible risk.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior. The code does not perform network activity, execute untrusted code, or contain obfuscated payloads.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation is present; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** The only minor concern is the use of regex to strip all HTML tags (`re_tag.sub(r'<>', body)`). While this is not malicious, regex-based HTML manipulation can sometimes be fragile or lead to unexpected behavior if the input is malformed. However, given the benign nature and purpose, this does not constitute a security risk.\n\n**Overall my assessment:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious intent or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, due to regex-based HTML stripping, but not dangerous)\n\n---\n\n### Final note:\nThe reports are consistent, and the code appears to be a standard, benign HTML content extraction utility. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risk are present.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the overall safety profile of the code.",
