  "purpose": "HTML content extraction and cleaning by removing scripts, styles, comments, links, media, and inline tags, then filtering blocks based on length and trash ratio.",
  "sources": "DOM tree input, reading HTML elements and comments, regex for tag removal.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data sinks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input DOM -> deep copy -> removal of specific tags and comments -> serialization -> normalization -> regex tag removal -> block extraction and filtering.",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex to strip all HTML tags (re.compile(r'<[^>]+>')) and replace with '<>' could be inefficient or fragile, but not malicious; commented-out logging code is harmless but may be confusing.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard HTML cleaning and content block extraction with heuristics. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The regex-based tag removal is benign in this context. The functions are straightforward, with no external communication or suspicious patterns. The '_trash_ratio' heuristic counts punctuation characters, which is benign. The overall structure and behavior are consistent with a benign content extraction utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard HTML content extractor with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk is minimal (~0.1) due to regex usage, which is benign in this context. The assessments in all reports are accurate and justified.",
