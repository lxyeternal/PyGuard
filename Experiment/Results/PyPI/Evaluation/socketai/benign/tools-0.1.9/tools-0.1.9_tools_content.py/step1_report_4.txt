{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to process an HTML DOM tree, remove specific tags and comments, normalize and clean the text content, and extract certain content blocks based on length and content quality.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from an lxml DOM tree object passed as a parameter and from the internal string processing functions.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes data to external systems, network, or files in an insecure manner. No untrusted data is sent externally or stored insecurely.",
  "flows": "Input DOM tree -> Deepcopy and modify DOM (remove tags and comments) -> Convert to string -> Normalize space -> Remove tags using regex -> Extract text blocks -> Filter based on length and trash ratio.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors detected. The code performs standard DOM cleaning and text processing without obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or hidden operations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and two functions from 'tools.text', which are presumed safe. It makes a deepcopy of the DOM tree to avoid external modifications. It removes typical HTML content, including scripts, styles, comments, links, media tags, and inline tags. It converts the cleaned DOM to a string, normalizes spaces, and strips all tags using regex, then extracts text blocks based on length and trash ratio. The '_trash_ratio' function calculates the proportion of special characters in the text. No data leaks, external network calls, or malicious patterns are evident. The code appears purely for content extraction and cleaning.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign HTML content processing utility intended for extracting clean text blocks from DOM trees. No malicious intent or security risks are present.",
