{
  "purpose": "The code processes HTML content to extract clean text blocks by removing specific tags and comments, normalizing space, and filtering based on content quality.",
  "sources": "Reads the input HTML DOM tree and its string representation.",
  "sinks": "Uses regex substitution on the HTML string, potentially altering content but not in a malicious way; no other external data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Copies the DOM tree -> Strips specific tags and comments -> Converts to string -> Normalizes space -> Removes all tags with regex -> Finds text blocks -> Filters blocks based on length and trash ratio.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of deep copy to avoid side effects is standard. No suspicious network activity, data leaks, or malicious behaviors detected. Commented-out code is benign but unnecessary.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily focuses on cleaning and extracting text from HTML content. It utilizes lxml for DOM manipulation, which is a standard approach. The regex replaces all tags with '<>', which could be considered unnecessary but not malicious. The function _trash_ratio evaluates the proportion of special characters to filter out non-informative blocks, a typical text processing technique. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or security risks. No external data transmission or dangerous system calls are present. Overall, the code appears safe and solely aimed at content parsing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard HTML content processing module with no malicious behavior detected. It functions to extract and filter text blocks from HTML trees, using common libraries and techniques. No malware or security risks are present based on the analysis.",
