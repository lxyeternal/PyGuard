{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for file processing, URL handling, hashing, and directory management.",
  "sources": "Reads files for 'unique_file' and 'unique_host' functions; reads URLs for 'hashed_path_details' and 'hashed_path'; reads and deletes files/directories in 'clear_directory'.",
  "sinks": "Writes modified data back to files in 'unique_file' and 'unique_host'; deletes files and directories in 'clear_directory'.",
  "flows": "Reads data from files, processes URLs and strings, writes results back to files, deletes filesystem data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. Logging is used for debug purposes but does not pose risk. The code involves file and directory manipulations and URL processing with no evident malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manipulates files and URLs with standard Python modules, performing deduplication ('unique_file', 'unique_host'), hashing for path generation ('hashed_path_details', 'hashed_path'), and directory cleanup ('clear_directory'). No obfuscated code, network connections, or malicious data handling are present. The deprecated 'hash_path' only logs a debug message. No signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks are detected. The code appears safe and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard utility functions with no malicious intent or security risks. It handles file and directory operations securely and transparently. No anomalies or malware signatures are present.",
