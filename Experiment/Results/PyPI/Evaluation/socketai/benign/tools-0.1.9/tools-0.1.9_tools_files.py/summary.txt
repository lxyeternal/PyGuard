  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code with no signs of supply chain compromise, malware, or obfuscation. The only minor concern is the destructive 'clear_directory' function, which should be used carefully. The overall security risk score of approximately 0.2 is appropriate given its utility nature. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly zero."
