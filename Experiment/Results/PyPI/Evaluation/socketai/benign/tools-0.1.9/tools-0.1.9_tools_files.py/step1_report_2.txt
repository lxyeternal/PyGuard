{
  "purpose": "Provide miscellaneous utility functions for file and URL processing, including deduplication, hashing, and directory management.",
  "sources": "File reading in unique_file, unique_host; URL input in hashed_path_details and hashed_path; directory paths in clear_directory.",
  "sinks": "File write operations in unique_file and unique_host; directory and file deletions in clear_directory.",
  "flows": "Input files and URLs are read; deduplicated data or hashed paths are written; directories are cleared.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected; standard utility functions; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for deduplicating lines in files, filtering URLs by hostname, generating hashed file paths, and clearing directories. All operations are straightforward file or string manipulations. No external network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious logic is present. Functions handle typical tasks like reading files, hashing URLs, and managing directories without any suspicious or malicious activity. Deprecated functions are logged with warnings but not malicious. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated logic are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of benign utility functions with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It performs standard file and URL processing tasks safely and transparently.",
