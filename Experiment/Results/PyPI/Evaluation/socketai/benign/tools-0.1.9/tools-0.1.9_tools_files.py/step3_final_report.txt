  "purpose": "Utility functions for deduplication, URL hostname filtering, path hashing, and directory cleanup.",
  "sources": "File reads in 'unique_file' and 'unique_host'; URL processing in 'hashed_path_details'; directory operations in 'clear_directory'.",
  "sinks": "File write operations; directory deletion in 'clear_directory'.",
  "flows": "Reading lines from files, processing URLs, generating paths, and deleting files/directories.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'sha1' hashing on URLs; 'clear_directory' deletes files recursively; deprecated 'hash_path' logs debug message.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of standard utility functions with straightforward logic. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected. The only potential risk is the 'clear_directory' function, which deletes files recursively and could be misused, but this is typical for cleanup utilities. The hashing functions assume string inputs without validation, which could lead to errors if inputs are malformed. The deprecated alias 'hash_path' only logs a debug message and is harmless. Overall, the code is benign, with minimal security concerns, primarily related to filesystem operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code with no signs of supply chain compromise, malware, or obfuscation. The only minor concern is the destructive 'clear_directory' function, which should be used carefully. The overall security risk score of approximately 0.2 is appropriate given its utility nature. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly zero.",
