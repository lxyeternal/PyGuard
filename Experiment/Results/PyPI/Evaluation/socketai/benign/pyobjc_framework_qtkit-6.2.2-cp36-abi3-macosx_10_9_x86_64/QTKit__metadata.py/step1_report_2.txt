{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define metadata, constants, enums, function signatures, aliases, protocols, and registers method metadata for Objective-C classes and selectors, likely used for interfacing with macOS/iOS frameworks related to QuickTime and media processing.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from the 'sys' module, uses 'objc.createStructType' for struct definitions, string constants, and metadata registration functions.",
  "sinks": "The registration function 'objc.registerMetaDataForSelector' acts as a sink for method signatures and type information; no untrusted input or external data sources are evident.",
  "flows": "Metadata definitions flow into the registration calls, which provide type info for Objective-C selectors, with no indication of data flow from external untrusted sources to vulnerable sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data are present. The code mostly consists of structured data for framework interoperability. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically defines structure types based on system architecture, extensive constants, enums, and function signatures for Objective-C method interfacing, then registers metadata for numerous selectors. Protocols are declared as informal Objective-C protocols with specific method signatures. No input from external sources, network activity, or malicious payloads are present. The code appears to serve as a framework or binding layer for media frameworks without any malicious intent or sabotage. There are no suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or obfuscated patterns beyond standard Objective-C runtime metadata definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a structured metadata and interface definition layer for media-related Objective-C classes, with no signs of malicious behavior, malicious data flow, or sabotage. It appears to be a legitimate part of a media framework binding or extension. No malicious or maliciously suspicious elements are detected.",
