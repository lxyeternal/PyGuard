  "purpose": "Auto-generated Objective-C bridging code for media framework metadata registration, including structures, constants, protocols, and method signatures for QTKit and related media classes.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'objc', 'sys', and string constants; no external untrusted input involved.",
  "sinks": "Metadata registration functions, structure creation, and method signature declarations, typical for framework setup.",
  "flows": "Internal registration and metadata definitions; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is standard, auto-generated Objective-C metadata setup for media frameworks. It involves no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks. The purpose is to facilitate Objective-C runtime interoperability with media APIs. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, structural setup for media framework interop, with no malicious intent or security risks. It solely defines data structures, constants, and method signatures for system frameworks.",
