{
  "purpose": "To dynamically load and register the QTKit framework for Python integration on macOS.",
  "sources": "Import statements (sys, Cocoa, objc, Quartz, QTKit), framework path (/System/Library/Frameworks/QTKit.framework)",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data handling or external input/output observed.",
  "flows": "Imports and framework loading occur at module import time; no data flows from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The deletion of internal modules suggests cleanup but is not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a lazy-loading module for QTKit framework using objc.ObjCLazyModule, a standard approach on macOS for dynamic framework loading. It imports necessary system and framework modules, assigns the framework to sys.modules under 'QTKit', and then removes internal modules '_metadata' and '_QTKit' from sys.modules, likely for cleanup. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation. The code is straightforward and aligns with normal Python binding practices for system frameworks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate and standard framework loading pattern for QTKit in Python, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
