{
  "purpose": "The code dynamically loads the QTKit framework on macOS using Objective-C bridging via Python, creating a lazy module and inserting it into sys.modules.",
  "sources": "The hardcoded framework path '/System/Library/Frameworks/QTKit.framework' and the import statements for Cocoa, Quartz, and objc modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows; the code only manipulates modules and loads a system framework.",
  "flows": "Importing modules -> creating objc.ObjCLazyModule -> assigning to sys.modules['QTKit'] -> deleting internal modules.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward module loading, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard dynamic loading of a system framework using objc.ObjCLazyModule, with no external input or malicious operations. It assigns the module to sys.modules and cleans up internal modules. No signs of obfuscation, malware, or security issues are present. The framework path is a typical system directory, and the code's purpose is benign. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard pattern for loading a system framework in Python on macOS. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The low security risk score (0.1) is appropriate given the context. All reports are accurate and consistent; no improvements are necessary.",
