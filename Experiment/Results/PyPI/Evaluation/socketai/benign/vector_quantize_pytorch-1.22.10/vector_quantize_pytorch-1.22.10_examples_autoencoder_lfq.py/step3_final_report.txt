  "purpose": "Training a vector quantized autoencoder on FashionMNIST dataset for image reconstruction.",
  "sources": "Dataset loading via torchvision.datasets.FashionMNIST, input data fed into the model during training.",
  "sinks": "Model outputs reconstructed images; no external network communication or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input images from dataset flow into the model; reconstructed images are produced; no external sinks involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard VQ autoencoder training routine using common libraries (PyTorch, torchvision, vector_quantize_pytorch). It loads data locally, defines a straightforward model architecture, and performs training with logging. No network activity, obfuscation, or malicious code is present. The third-party library used (LFQ) is a legitimate component for vector quantization. The code structure is clear, and the logic is standard for such ML tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
