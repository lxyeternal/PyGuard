  "purpose": "Implementation of residual vector quantization modules for neural network compression and representation learning, supporting distributed training and dropout mechanisms.",
  "sources": "Standard tensor inputs, imported modules, and internal data flows within the PyTorch framework.",
  "sinks": "No external network, file, or system calls; data flows are confined within tensor operations and model modules.",
  "flows": "Input tensors are processed through projections, residuals, and quantization layers; indices and codes flow from sources to outputs within the model.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns detected. Use of seed synchronization for dropout is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, well-structured implementation of residual vector quantization modules, including grouped variants, with support for distributed training and dropout. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The seed synchronization and controlled randomness are standard for reproducibility. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0, obfuscated 0, low risk 0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk score is justified by the standard practices employed. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, and the scores are appropriate.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
