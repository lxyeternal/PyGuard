  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \nAll reports confirm that the code only consists of import statements from the 'vector_quantize_pytorch' package. There is no evidence of data processing, dynamic code execution, network activity, or other potentially malicious behaviors. The code appears benign and standard for a machine learning setup.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \nThe reports uniformly identify that the code is purely import statements with no malicious intent. They do not note any logical errors or security flaws within the import statements themselves. Given the simplicity of the code, this is accurate.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning**:  \n- **Malware Score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward import statements.  \n- **Risk Score**: All reports assign a risk score of 0, which is reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk or Malware Scores**:  \nSince the code only involves static imports from a known, open-source library, there is no justification for increasing the malware or risk scores. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \nAll reports avoid assumptions and correctly identify that the code is standard and benign.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores**:  \nThe scores are consistent across reports and appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0**  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0**  \n- **Risk Score**: **0**\n\nThis code snippet is entirely benign. It only performs static imports from a known library related to vector quantization in PyTorch, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe code is safe, straightforward, and free from malicious or obfuscated elements. The current scoring reflects this accurately.",
