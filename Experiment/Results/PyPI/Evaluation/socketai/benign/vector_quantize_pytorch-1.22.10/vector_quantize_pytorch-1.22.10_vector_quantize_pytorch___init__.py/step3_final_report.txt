  "purpose": "Import various vector quantization classes and utilities from the 'vector_quantize_pytorch' library for use in a larger machine learning project.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from the 'vector_quantize_pytorch' package, importing classes and utilities related to vector quantization.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only imports modules and does not process data or perform actions at runtime.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or execution occurs within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code consists solely of straightforward import statements with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static set of import statements from a well-known open-source library. There is no dynamic code, data processing, network activity, or user input handling. The imports are standard for setting up vector quantization modules in PyTorch. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned by the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, consisting only of static import statements from a legitimate library. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current scores accurately reflect its safe and standard nature.",
