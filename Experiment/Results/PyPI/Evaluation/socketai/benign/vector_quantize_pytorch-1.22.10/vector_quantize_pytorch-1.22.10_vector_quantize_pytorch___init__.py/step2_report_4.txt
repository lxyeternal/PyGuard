  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code:**  \n   All reports identify that the code only contains static import statements from the 'vector_quantize_pytorch' library. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing. The code appears standard and benign.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is purely import statements with no malicious intent or obfuscation. No logical flaws or errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**  \n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports give 0, consistent with the straightforward import statements.  \n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign a risk score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**  \n   Since all evidence points to benign import statements with no malicious activity, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified. The scores of 0 are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**  \n   The malware scores are correctly set to 0, matching the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \n   All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions. They correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent across reports and align with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Overall assessment:**  \nThe code is a standard set of import statements from a well-known library. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code snippet is safe, benign, and poses no security threat. The scores assigned are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
