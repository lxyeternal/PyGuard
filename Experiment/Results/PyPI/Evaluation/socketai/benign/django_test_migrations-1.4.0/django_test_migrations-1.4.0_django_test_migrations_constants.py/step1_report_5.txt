  "analysis": "The code imports 'Final' from 'typing_extensions' to define an immutable constant, then assigns a descriptive string to 'MIGRATION_TEST_MARKER'. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious logic. The code appears to be a simple, clear declaration intended for use as a marker or tag within tests.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard declaration of a constant string used as a marker/tag for Django migration tests. No malicious intent or security concerns are evident.",
