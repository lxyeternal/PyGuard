  "purpose": "Define a constant string marker for Django migration tests.",
  "sources": "Import statement from typing_extensions; assignment of Final constant.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines a constant.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward constant definition and import.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'Final' from 'typing_extensions' to declare a constant 'MIGRATION_TEST_MARKER' with a fixed string value. It serves as a marker or tag for testing purposes related to Django migrations. There are no indications of malicious behavior, hidden code, or suspicious operations. The use of 'Final' is standard for indicating immutability of the constant.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, safe declaration of a constant marker used in testing contexts. There are no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation.",
