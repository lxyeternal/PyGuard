  "purpose": "Define a constant marker/tag for indicating Django migration tests",
  "sources": "Import statement from typing_extensions; assignment of a string to a constant",
  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows involving untrusted input",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward constant declaration",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'Final' from 'typing_extensions', which is used to declare immutable constants in Python. It then defines 'MIGRATION_TEST_MARKER' as a constant string 'migration_test'. This is a simple, static assignment with no dynamic code, no user input, and no external data sources. There are no suspicious behaviors, obfuscated code, or malicious intents evident. The code appears to serve as a marker or flag for testing purposes within a larger codebase.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward constant declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is intended for internal tagging or marking within a Django project.",
