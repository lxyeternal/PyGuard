  "purpose": "Define a constant string marker for indicating Django migration tests.",
  "sources": "The import from typing_extensions and the assignment to MIGRATION_TEST_MARKER.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; no data flows to external systems or outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are present in this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'Final' from typing_extensions to create an immutable constant string. It then defines a constant 'MIGRATION_TEST_MARKER' with a descriptive value. The code is minimal, straightforward, and serves a documentation or marker purpose. No external data input, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply defines a constant string used as a marker for Django migration tests. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks.",
