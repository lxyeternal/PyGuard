  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward import and constant assignment.\n   - There are no indications of malicious code, dynamic behavior, or data flows involving untrusted sources.\n   - The code's purpose is to define a constant marker for Django migration tests, which is benign.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident.\n   - They correctly state that the code is simple, static, and serves as a marker.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Malware: 0\n     - SecurityRisk: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all scores are zero for malware and security risk, and the code is a simple constant declaration, there is no justification for higher risk scores.\n   - The code does not perform any suspicious actions or contain vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign malware score as 0.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions.\n   - They correctly interpret the code as a benign marker declaration.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\n- The code is a simple, safe constant declaration.\n- All reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No malicious or obfuscated behavior is present.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final note:** This code is entirely benign and serves a documentation/marker purpose within a Django project.",
