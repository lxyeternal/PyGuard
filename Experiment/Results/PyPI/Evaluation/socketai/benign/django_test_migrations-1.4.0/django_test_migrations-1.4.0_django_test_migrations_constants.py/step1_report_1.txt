  "purpose": "Define a constant string marker for indicating Django migration tests",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'typing_extensions' module, assignment of a string to 'MIGRATION_TEST_MARKER'",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present",
  "flows": "Import from external module -> assignment of constant string",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'Final' from 'typing_extensions' is standard; no suspicious or unusual code behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'Final' from 'typing_extensions' and assigns a string value to a constant variable 'MIGRATION_TEST_MARKER'. The import and assignment are straightforward and align with typical Python practices for defining constants. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors. No input sources or data flows pose security risks. The code serves as a simple marker declaration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign constant definition used for marking migration tests in Django projects. No malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
