  "purpose": "Define a constant marker/tag indicating a Django migration test.",
  "sources": "Import of 'Final' from 'typing_extensions' and assignment of a string to 'MIGRATION_TEST_MARKER'.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "None; static assignment without data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward constant declaration with no dynamic or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a typing extension and declares a static, immutable string constant used as a marker. There are no data flows, external inputs, or dynamic code execution. The purpose is purely to serve as a tag within Django migration testing. All reports correctly identify the benign, static nature of this code. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, safe, and static constant declaration serving as a marker in Django migrations. There are no security concerns, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation present. The current assessment and scores are accurate and should remain unchanged.",
