  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The original code is a straightforward import and constant assignment:\n     ```python\n     from typing_extensions import Final\n\n     #: marker/tag indicating that marked test is a Django's migration test\n     MIGRATION_TEST_MARKER: Final = 'migration_test'\n     ```\n   - All reports agree that this is a simple, static, benign constant declaration with no dynamic behavior, no user input, and no external data sources or sinks.\n   - **Conclusion:** No issues or vulnerabilities are present in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is a benign constant declaration.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - **Conclusion:** No errors or flaws in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores given to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - confidence: 1\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - malware: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Suggestion:** The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since all scores are zero for malware and security risk, no justification is needed for higher scores.\n   - **Conclusion:** No adjustments necessary.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n   - **Conclusion:** Malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions about vulnerabilities:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - **Conclusion:** No false claims or unwarranted assumptions.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - **Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code is a simple, static constant declaration with no security risks.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Final note:** The code is benign; no security concerns are present.",
