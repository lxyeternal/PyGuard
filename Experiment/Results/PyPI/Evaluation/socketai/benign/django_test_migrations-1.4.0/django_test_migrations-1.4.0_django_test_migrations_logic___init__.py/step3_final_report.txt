{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a benign Python script with no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Standard input/output operations, function definitions, variable assignments, no external data sources or untrusted inputs identified.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, network connections, or sensitive data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "No malicious source-to-sink data flows detected; code execution follows typical benign patterns.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or unusual code constructs identified; code is straightforward and transparent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, clear Python script with no suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscation. The confidence in benign intent is high (0.9). No malicious behaviors, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are present. The security risk is minimal (0.2), reflecting a low but cautious stance due to limited context. The malware score is 0, consistent with the absence of malicious indicators. The obfuscated score is 0, aligning with the straightforward code structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
