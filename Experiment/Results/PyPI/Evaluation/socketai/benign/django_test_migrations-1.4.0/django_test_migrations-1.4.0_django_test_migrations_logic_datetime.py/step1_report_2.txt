  "purpose": "The function converts a timedelta object to milliseconds.",
  "sources": "Input is the timedelta parameter passed to the function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data sources; the function only performs a calculation on the input parameter.",
  "flows": "Input timedelta -> total_seconds() method -> multiply by 1000 -> convert to int -> return result",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward and uses standard library functions without any obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function that takes a datetime.timedelta object as input and returns its equivalent in milliseconds. It uses the standard method total_seconds() and performs a simple arithmetic operation, then casts to int. No external data sources, no hardcoded credentials, and no suspicious behavior are present. The code appears to be a utility function with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign utility function for converting timedelta objects to milliseconds. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
