  "purpose": "Utility function to convert a datetime.timedelta object into milliseconds.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'timedelta' which is a datetime.timedelta object.",
  "sinks": "The conversion operation using timedelta.total_seconds() and int() casting; no external data or untrusted input handling beyond the input parameter.",
  "flows": "Input timedelta -> total_seconds() -> multiplication by 1000 -> cast to int -> output integer milliseconds.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and standard for this utility function. No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The function accepts a timedelta object, computes total seconds, multiplies by 1000 to convert to milliseconds, and casts the result to an integer. This is a common, safe operation with no external data leaks, no untrusted data sources, or dangerous behaviors observed. The code is minimal and clear, with proper documentation. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple and safe conversion of a timedelta to milliseconds. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
