  "purpose": "Convert a datetime.timedelta object to milliseconds.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'timedelta' of type datetime.timedelta.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the function simply performs a calculation and returns an integer.",
  "flows": "Input timedelta -> total_seconds() method -> multiplication by 1000 -> int cast -> return.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward conversion without suspicious code or data handling.",
  "analysis": "The function takes a timedelta object, calls its total_seconds() method to obtain the duration in seconds, multiplies by 1000 to convert to milliseconds, and casts the result to int for return. There are no external data sources, no untrusted input handling beyond the timedelta parameter, and no use of environment variables or insecure functions. The code performs a simple, well-defined conversion without side effects or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility function for converting timedelta objects to milliseconds. It contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. The implementation is straightforward and safe.",
