  "purpose": "Convert a datetime.timedelta object into milliseconds.",
  "sources": "The function takes a timedelta object as input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or output outside the function.",
  "flows": "Input timedelta -> total_seconds() -> multiply by 1000 -> cast to int -> output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function that converts a timedelta to milliseconds by using total_seconds() and multiplying by 1000. No external data sources, no sinks, and no suspicious code patterns. The function appears to be a utility for time conversion. The code does not include any I/O operations, environment variable usage, or external network calls. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple utility function for converting timedelta objects to milliseconds. It does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The code appears safe and straightforward.",
