  "purpose": "Define a custom exception for handling cases where a MigrationTarget is not found in a migration plan.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing MigrationTarget from django_test_migrations.types; class instantiation and string formatting within __str__ method.",
  "sinks": "String formatting in __str__ method, potentially exposing internal object details if the exception is raised.",
  "flows": "MigrationTarget object is passed to the exception and later converted to string, potentially revealing internal data in logs or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; standard exception class definition with safe string formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class inheriting from Exception, used to signal that a specific migration target was not found. The __init__ method stores the target object, and the __str__ method returns a formatted string including this object. The import is from a test migrations module, which is typical in testing or migration management code. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious activities, or obfuscated code. No sensitive data handling, network activity, or malicious commands are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward, benign exception class definition with no malicious intent or security risks.",
