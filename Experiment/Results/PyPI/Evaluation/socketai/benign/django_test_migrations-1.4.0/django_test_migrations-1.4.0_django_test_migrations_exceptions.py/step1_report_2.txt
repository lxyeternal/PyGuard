  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling cases where a migration target is not found in the migration plan.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'MigrationTarget' from 'django_test_migrations.types' and the class definition which uses this imported type.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling, user input, or external outputs that could be exploited.",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted input; the code only defines a class and its constructor for error handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward, defining an exception class with a custom message.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a type, defines a custom exception class, and implements its constructor and string representation method. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is present. It appears to be standard error handling implementation with no suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical exception class definition for error handling related to migration targets. It contains no malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks.",
