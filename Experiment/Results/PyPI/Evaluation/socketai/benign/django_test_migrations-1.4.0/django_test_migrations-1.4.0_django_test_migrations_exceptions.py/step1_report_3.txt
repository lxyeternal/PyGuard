{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class for handling cases where a migration target is not found in a plan.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'MigrationTarget' from 'django_test_migrations.types'. The class constructor and string method do not read external input.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include any sinks that could lead to data leaks, system effects, or security issues.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the class only encapsulates an exception with a specific message.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; standard exception class with straightforward implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a type, defines an exception class with an initializer storing a 'MigrationTarget', and a string method that formats an error message. All elements follow standard Python practices for exception handling. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, well-structured custom exception class with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves a clear purpose within a larger codebase and does not introduce security concerns.",
