  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the context, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code defines a simple custom exception class.\n- The code imports `MigrationTarget` from an external module (`django_test_migrations.types`) and uses it solely for type annotation and in the exception's string representation.\n- No untrusted data handling, external communication, or dynamic execution occurs.\n- The exception class is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The import from `django_test_migrations.types` suggests this code may be part of testing or migration management, not production security-sensitive code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Potential Issues:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly state that the code is a standard exception class with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No. The code is correct, idiomatic, and safe.\n\n---\n\n### Score Analysis:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate. No malicious behavior is detected or implied.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is justified. The code does not introduce any security risk.\n\n### Potential discrepancies:\n- The only minor point is that the last report mentions that including `self.migration_target` in the exception message could potentially expose internal object details if the exception is logged or displayed. While this is a valid consideration, in this context, it does not constitute a security vulnerability, especially since the object is a `MigrationTarget`—likely a simple data structure. If `MigrationTarget` has sensitive info, then exposing it in logs could be a concern, but this is more about logging practices than code security.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores across all reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### My overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is clear)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\nThis code is a benign, standard exception class definition used for error handling in migration plans. The import from a test migrations module suggests it's part of testing or migration logic, not security-sensitive code.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, straightforward, and well-structured. The scores assigned are appropriate. No further action needed.",
