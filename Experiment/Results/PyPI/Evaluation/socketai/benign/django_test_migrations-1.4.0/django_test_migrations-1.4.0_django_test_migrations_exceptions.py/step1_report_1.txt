{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling cases where a migration target is not found in a plan.",
  "sources": "The code imports a class from an external module (`django_test_migrations.types`) and uses it as a type annotation and in exception handling.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted input or data; the exception message is constructed from an internal variable.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external untrusted sources to sensitive operations; the exception is constructed from a known internal object.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple exception class inheriting from Python's built-in Exception. It takes a 'MigrationTarget' object as an argument and customizes the string representation of the exception. It imports a class from an external module, but does not perform any dynamic execution, data processing, or external communications. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks, and the code appears straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard exception class definition used for error handling in migration plans. No malicious intent, no security vulnerabilities, and no obfuscated or suspicious behaviors are present.",
