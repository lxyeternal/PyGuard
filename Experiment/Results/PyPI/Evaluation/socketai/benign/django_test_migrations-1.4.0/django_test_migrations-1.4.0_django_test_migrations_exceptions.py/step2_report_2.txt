  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, the consistency of their scores, and whether any adjustments are warranted.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the same code: a simple custom exception class that references an imported `MigrationTarget` type.\n- They consistently conclude that the code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The code's purpose is clear: signal when a migration target isn't found in a plan.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present in the code:\n- The code is straightforward and does not contain any issues such as vulnerabilities, obfuscation, or malicious logic.\n- The exception class is standard, with no external data processing or untrusted input handling.\n- **Scores assigned:**\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Malware: 0\n  - SecurityRisk: 0\n- These are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n### Logical flaws, errors, or mistakes:\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are evident.\n- The code correctly implements a custom exception with a meaningful string representation.\n- The import from `django_test_migrations.types` is typical in testing contexts and does not raise security concerns.\n\n### Scores review:\n- The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- No adjustments needed here.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- Since all scores are zero, there's no need to justify higher risk scores.\n- The code does not perform any network activity, data processing, or dynamic execution.\n\n### Claims based on assumptions:\n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the code as a standard exception class.\n- The mention of the import from a test migrations module is noted but not considered suspicious.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All reports assign a score of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which is consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n- The import from `django_test_migrations.types` suggests this code might be part of testing or migration tooling, not production logic. This further reduces any security concern.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The code is a straightforward, benign exception class.\n- The reports' evaluations are accurate and consistent.\n- No changes to scores or conclusions are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's simplicity and the absence of any suspicious or malicious elements.",
