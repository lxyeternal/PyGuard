  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling cases where a migration target is not found in the migration plan.",
  "sources": "Import of 'MigrationTarget' from 'django_test_migrations.types' used in type annotation and exception message.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, external communication, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "The 'migration_target' object is stored and converted to string in the exception message; no external data flow or processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Including 'self.migration_target' in the exception message could potentially expose internal details if the object contains sensitive info, but this is standard for exception messages and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward custom exception class with a constructor and string representation. It imports a type for annotation purposes. No untrusted input handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The import from a test migration module suggests this is test or migration management code, not production security-sensitive code. The exception message includes an object, which could leak internal info if sensitive, but this is typical and not inherently risky. All signals indicate benign, well-structured code with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard exception class used for signaling missing migration targets. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores are appropriate: malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, security risk score 0.",
