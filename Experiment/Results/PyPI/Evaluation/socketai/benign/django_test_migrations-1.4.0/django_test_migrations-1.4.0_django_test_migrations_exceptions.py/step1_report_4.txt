  "purpose": "Define a custom exception for handling cases where a migration target is not found in the migration plan.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'MigrationTarget' from 'django_test_migrations.types'. No other input sources present.",
  "sinks": "None. No data is sent to external systems or untrusted outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code solely defines a class and an exception.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns observed. The code is straightforward class definition.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class, then defines a custom exception class that stores a 'MigrationTarget' object and provides a string representation. No input validation, data processing, network activity, or obfuscated code is present. The import from a test migrations module appears to be for testing purposes, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple class definition for a specific exception, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears to be part of testing or migration handling logic without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
