{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to drop all tables associated with Django models and to flush the django_migrations table in a specified database.",
  "sources": "Database connection and introspection methods, and SQL execution functions via Django's ORM.",
  "sinks": "Execution of raw SQL statements through connection.ops.execute_sql_flush() which executes SQL commands to manipulate database tables.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (database_name, style) -> database connection -> introspection to retrieve table names -> SQL template formatting -> execution of SQL commands to drop tables or flush migrations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns. Use of SQL template strings appears standard, relying on Django ORM abstractions. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The functions utilize Django's standard ORM features to introspect and manipulate database tables. They correctly handle disabling foreign key checks for MySQL, and they operate solely on database schema objects without executing any untrusted user input or external data. The code is straightforward, using Django's provided methods and constants, with no signs of malicious behavior or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django database management utility for dropping tables and flushing migration history. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It operates within expected parameters of Django ORM functionalities.",
