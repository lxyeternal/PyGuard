{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for dropping all tables of a Django database connection and flushing the django_migrations table.",
  "sources": "Reads include: connection.introspection.django_table_names() to list tables, and connection.ops.execute_sql_flush() and connection.ops.sql_flush() to execute SQL commands.",
  "sinks": "SQL execution via connection.ops.execute_sql_flush() and connection.SchemaEditorClass.sql_delete_table with dynamic SQL content.",
  "flows": "Source: retrieving table names -> sink: executing SQL commands to drop tables and flush migration table.",
  "anomalies": "Uses string formatting to inject table names into SQL statements; however, this is standard for Django's ORM. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious data present. No obfuscated code or hidden dynamic execution. Foreign key constraints are temporarily disabled for MySQL, which is standard procedure.",
  "analysis": "The code interacts solely with Django's database abstraction layer to list and drop tables, and to flush the django_migrations table. It uses Django's established practices for handling SQL commands, including quote_name for safety against SQL injection. No untrusted input is incorporated directly into raw SQL strings; the only dynamic content is table names retrieved from the database schema, which are properly quoted. No external network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The functions serve legitimate maintenance purposes without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Django database maintenance utility with no malicious behavior or security risks. It safely interacts with the database through Django's ORM and abstractions, with no signs of malware or malicious activity.",
