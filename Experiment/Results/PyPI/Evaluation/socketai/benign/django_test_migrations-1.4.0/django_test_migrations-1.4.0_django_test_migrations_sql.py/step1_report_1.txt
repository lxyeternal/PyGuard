  "purpose": "The code provides functions to drop all tables of a Django database connection and to flush the django_migrations table.",
  "sources": "Reading the database connection parameters, introspection of table names, and SQL execution commands.",
  "sinks": "Execution of SQL commands to drop tables and flush migration data, potentially affecting database schema and data.",
  "flows": "Source: retrieving table names and connection info → sink: executing SQL drop/flush commands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual code patterns; no obfuscated code; uses standard Django and Python methods. No suspicious commands or behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code uses Django's ORM and connection interfaces to safely drop tables and flush migration history. It performs introspection to determine existing tables, then constructs and executes SQL commands for dropping tables, with special handling for MySQL foreign key checks. The flush function specifically targets the django_migrations table, using Django's safe methods. There are no signs of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or external network connections. The code operates solely on the database via Django's ORM abstractions, with no external data leaks or system modifications beyond schema changes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility for managing Django database tables and migration history. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident. It is safe in the context of schema management, assuming proper permissions and intended use.",
