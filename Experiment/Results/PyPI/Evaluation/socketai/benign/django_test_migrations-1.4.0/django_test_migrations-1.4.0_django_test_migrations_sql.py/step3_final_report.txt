  "flows": "Source: introspection and schema methods -> SQL command construction -> execution via connection.ops.execute_sql_flush.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes Django ORM and schema tools to safely identify and delete database tables, with proper handling for foreign key constraints on MySQL. No user input is incorporated into SQL commands, mitigating injection risks. The functions are intended for database maintenance, not malicious activities. The absence of obfuscation, suspicious commands, or external communications indicates a benign purpose. The low risk scores assigned in the reports are justified, considering the destructive potential if misused, but are standard for such utility functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe Django utility for schema management with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate, and the security risk remains minimal when used with proper permissions. Overall, the code poses no significant security threat.",
