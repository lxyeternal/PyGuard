{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to analyze and generate migration plans for Django applications, primarily for testing migration order and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from Django's app configuration, migration graph, and migration loader, particularly from 'apps.get_app_config', 'connections[database]', and 'loader.graph'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or send untrusted data externally; it processes internal data structures. No sinks that transmit data over the network or access system resources are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from 'app_names' validation through migration graph processing and into plan generation functions, culminating in returned migration plans. No external data flow to untrusted sources or sinks is identified.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious or unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code structure is standard for Django migration handling. No signs of malicious code or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script employs standard Django migration loader and graph functionalities to generate migration plans and validate app names. It contains no external network calls, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious behaviors. The functions serve documentation, validation, and plan truncation purposes without any security risks. The code appears to be a typical utility for migration testing and planning, with no anomalies or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Django migration utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs internal data handling related to migrations without external communication or malicious payloads. Overall, the code is safe and unobfuscated.",
