{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for analyzing Django migration plans, including retrieving migration nodes, validating app names, generating migration plans, and truncating plans for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from Django's migration loader, app configs, and migration graph structures. It does not read external or untrusted input data.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks or malicious actions. No network connections, file writes, or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "The code flows mainly involve retrieving migration nodes and filtering or processing them within in-memory data structures. No external or untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are detected. The code adheres to typical Django migration handling patterns. No obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard Django modules and a custom exception and types. It defines functions for listing, validating, and processing migration nodes and plans, all of which operate on in-memory data or Django internal APIs. There are no external inputs, command executions, or network activities. The logic is straightforward, mainly validation and list manipulation. No suspicious or malicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility module for managing Django migration plans. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely manipulates internal data structures and provides utility functions for testing migration order and planning.",
