  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured Django migration testing utility with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The external SQL functions used are typical in test environments; their safety should be confirmed, but their presence does not indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero."
