  "purpose": "Manage Django migrations during testing, including applying, resetting, and controlling migration states.",
  "sources": "Internal parameters, Django APIs, external SQL functions (`sql.drop_models_tables`, `sql.flush_django_migrations_table`).",
  "sinks": "Database schema modifications, migration application, schema resets.",
  "flows": "Inputs from parameters and Django APIs flow into schema modification functions and migration execution methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected; external SQL functions are standard in test setups but should be verified for safety.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility for managing migrations in testing environments, utilizing Django's migration framework and external SQL functions for schema resets. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscation are present. External functions are typical for test setups but could pose risks if maliciously implemented. The overall structure and usage are consistent with legitimate testing utilities. The low risk scores (around 0.1-0.2) reflect minimal inherent risk, primarily due to schema modification functions, which are standard in testing but should be trusted.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured Django migration testing utility with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The external SQL functions used are typical in test environments; their safety should be confirmed, but their presence does not indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero.",
