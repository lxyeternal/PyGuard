  "purpose": "Assessment of open source dependency's supply chain security based on provided code snippets.",
  "sources": "No code provided; analysis based on descriptions and absence of code snippets.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks identified due to lack of code.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows observable; absence of code prevents flow analysis.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; absence of code limits detection of suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly note the absence of code, limiting the ability to identify malicious behavior. The assigned malware scores are zero, consistent with no evidence of malicious activity. Risk scores are low (0.2), reflecting minimal concern but acknowledging the inability to fully assess without code. Confidence levels are appropriate, ranging from 0.2 to 0.8, based on the descriptions. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious indicators are identified in any report.",
  "conclusion": "Given the lack of code snippets, the assessments are justified. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.2 are appropriate and consistent across all reports. No adjustments are necessary; the evaluations are cautious yet reasonable.",
