  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly clear from the provided snippet, but it appears to perform some data processing or utility functions, possibly related to network or system operations.",
  "sources": "Input data could originate from environment variables, user input, or external system calls. Specific source points are not visible in the snippet provided.",
  "sinks": "Potential sink points include network connections, file operations, or system commands if present, but none are explicitly identified in the code snippet provided.",
  "flows": "Without explicit source and sink points shown, the data flow cannot be fully mapped. The code seems to perform internal computations without external data flows evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or unusual code patterns are visible. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution appears present in the provided snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be straightforward, involving standard library functions and typical control structures. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communications, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The lack of external input handling or sensitive operations suggests a benign intent. However, the absence of context limits full assessment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears standard and safe, with no anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
