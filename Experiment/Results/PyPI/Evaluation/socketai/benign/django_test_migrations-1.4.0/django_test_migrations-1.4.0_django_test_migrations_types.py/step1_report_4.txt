  "purpose": "Define type aliases for Django migration and database connection-related data structures.",
  "sources": "No user input or external data sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling points are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks, as the code only defines type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected. The code is straightforward type alias declarations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules and defines type aliases to improve code clarity and type checking in Django database and migration contexts. It only includes type annotations and comments explaining their intended use. There are no input/output operations, no data processing, and no malicious patterns such as network communication, file access, or code execution. The structure is simple and adheres to standard practices for type hinting in Python.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of type alias definitions used for type safety and clarity within a Django project. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks present in this fragment.",
