  "purpose": "Define type aliases for Django migration operations and database connection handling.",
  "sources": "Type alias definitions; importing modules from Django and typing_extensions.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data processing, input/output, or external calls present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; code only establishes type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward type alias declarations and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules related to Django database connections and migration objects, then defines several type aliases for clarity and type checking in Django migrations and database configurations. There are no functions, data processing, or external interactions. The code appears to serve as a type hints module, enhancing code readability and type safety. No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of type alias definitions intended for type checking within Django database migration contexts. There is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks.",
