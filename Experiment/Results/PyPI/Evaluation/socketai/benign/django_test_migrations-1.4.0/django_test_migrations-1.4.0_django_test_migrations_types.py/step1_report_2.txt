  "purpose": "Defines type aliases for Django migration and database connection-related data structures.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted input sources are present; the code imports modules and defines type aliases.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling points are present; no data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code solely defines type aliases without runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard Django modules and typing extensions, then defines several type aliases for migration plans, database connections, and settings. These definitions serve as type hints and do not involve any runtime logic, data handling, or external input processing. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks within these definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for type annotation purposes within a Django project and does not contain any malicious or suspicious elements. It has no data flow, no input/output operations, and no security concerns.",
