  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code content, logic, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n\n- The code consists solely of type alias definitions for Django migration and database connection objects.\n- All reports agree that there are no data flows, no input/output, no dynamic code, and no suspicious behavior.\n- The imports are standard, and the comments clarify the purpose of each alias.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks is present.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Review:\n\n**1. Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n\n- The code is straightforward type alias definitions with no runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions.\n- Confirmed: **No issues or malicious code are present.**\n\n**2. Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign, purely for type hinting.\n- No logical flaws or mistakes in reasoning are evident.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n\n**3. Scores and Justifications:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the code's nature.\n- **Security Risk:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0 or very low, which is appropriate.\n\n**4. Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n\n- No suspicious assumptions are made; all assessments are consistent with the code content.\n\n**5. Consistency of Scores:**\n\n- The scores across reports are consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated Score:** **0**  \n**Risk Score:** **0**\n\nThe code is a standard, safe set of type alias definitions used for type hinting in a Django project. There are no security concerns, malicious intent, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- **The code is benign, with no malware, security risks, or obfuscation.**\n- **Scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent.**\n- **No changes needed.**\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nKeep the scores at **malware=0**, **obfuscated=0**, and **risk=0**. The code is safe and standard for its purpose.",
