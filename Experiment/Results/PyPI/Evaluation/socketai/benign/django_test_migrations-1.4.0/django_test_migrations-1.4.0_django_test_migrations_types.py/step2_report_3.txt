  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is solely type alias definitions with descriptive comments. No runtime logic, data handling, or security-sensitive operations.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Both are correctly identified as zero.\n- **Score justification:** The report's conclusion that there's no malicious intent or security risk is accurate.\n- **Verdict:** No issues; the report is reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; purely type alias definitions, no data flow or input/output.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Correctly identified as zero.\n- **Score justification:** The reasoning is sound.\n- **Verdict:** No issues; the report is accurate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern—type aliases for Django migration and connection types, no dynamic code or data processing.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Correctly zero.\n- **Score justification:** The reasoning aligns with the code's static nature.\n- **Verdict:** No issues; the report is appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, straightforward type alias definitions, no runtime or malicious behavior.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Correctly zero.\n- **Score justification:** The reasoning is consistent.\n- **Verdict:** No issues; the report is valid.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as others; static type alias definitions with no dynamic or malicious elements.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Correctly zero.\n- **Score justification:** The analysis is accurate.\n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Code presence:** Only type alias definitions, no executable code, data handling, or external interactions.\n- **Malware potential:** None detected; the code is purely for type hinting.\n- **Obfuscation:** Not applicable; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** None evident.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\nGiven the uniformity across all reports and the nature of the code, I agree with the assessments that these are benign, standard type alias definitions for Django projects. The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should all remain at **0**.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code fragment poses no security threat or malware risk.",
