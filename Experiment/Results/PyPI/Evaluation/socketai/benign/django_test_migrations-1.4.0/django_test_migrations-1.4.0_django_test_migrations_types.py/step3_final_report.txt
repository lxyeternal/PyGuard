  "purpose": "Type alias definitions for Django migration and connection objects used for type hinting.",
  "sources": "Import statements and comments indicating type aliases; no data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static type alias definitions without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and contains only type aliases.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type alias definitions for Django migration and connection types, with no functions, data processing, or dynamic code. All imports are standard, and comments clarify purpose. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is static and used for type hinting, with no external interactions or runtime logic. The malware score is appropriately zero, as there are no malicious indicators. The security risk score is zero, consistent with the benign nature. The code's simplicity and clarity justify high confidence in benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of type alias definitions for Django projects, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
