  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, the reasoning, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is solely composed of type alias definitions for Django migration and connection objects.\n- All reports agree that the code is static, straightforward, and serves as type hints.\n- No runtime logic, data processing, input/output, or external interactions are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The malware score is consistently zero across all reports, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of malicious intent or malware:**\n   - The code only defines type aliases; there are no functions, network calls, file access, or code execution.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The reports correctly identify this as benign.\n\n2. **Risk scores:**\n   - The reports assign a security risk of 0 and malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Since the code is purely type annotations, a risk score above 0.5 would be unreasonable.\n\n3. **Obfuscated score:**\n   - All reports assign 0 or 0.0, which is correct.\n\n4. **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n   - No claims are made that rely on assumptions; the analysis is consistent with the code's simplicity.\n\n5. **Scores consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code content.\n   - The confidence is high (1.0), which is justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The type alias definitions are standard and serve as documentation/type hints.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nNo changes needed. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis: a benign, purely static type alias declaration with no security implications.",
