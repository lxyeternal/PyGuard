{
  "purpose": "Define type aliases related to Django database migrations and connections.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; type annotations are static and defined within the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code consists solely of type alias definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; static type alias definitions do not process runtime data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; purely type alias declarations without dynamic code or side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains type alias definitions for various Django migration and database connection objects. It imports standard typing modules and Django components but does not perform any data processing, I/O, or dynamic execution. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or security vulnerabilities. The code appears to be standard type annotations to improve code clarity and type checking.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, straightforward, and only defines type aliases for Django database migration and connection types. No malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks are present.",
