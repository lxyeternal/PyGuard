{
  "purpose": "The code defines a context manager to temporarily disable Django's migration signals (pre_migrate and post_migrate) by clearing their receivers list, then restoring them after the context block. This is useful during migrations or testing to prevent signal handlers from executing.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'receivers' attribute from 'pre_migrate' and 'post_migrate' signals to save their current state.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks; the code manipulates internal signal receiver lists without external input or output.",
  "flows": "The source is the retrieval of the 'receivers' lists; the sink is the assignment of empty lists to disable signals, followed by restoring the original lists.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and uses standard Django signal handling techniques.",
  "analysis": "The code captures the current signal receivers for 'pre_migrate' and 'post_migrate', clears these lists to disable signal handling temporarily, and then restores the original receivers after the context. It employs a standard pattern for managing signals during migrations or tests. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are evident. The logic is correct, and the code is clear and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for temporarily disabling Django migration signals. It does not contain malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1) are appropriate and justified.",
