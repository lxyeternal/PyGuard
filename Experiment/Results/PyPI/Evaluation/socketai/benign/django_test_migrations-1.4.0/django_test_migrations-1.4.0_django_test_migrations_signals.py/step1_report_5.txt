  "purpose": "The code provides a context manager to temporarily disable Django migration signals during a block of code execution.",
  "sources": "Reads the current list of signal receivers from django.db.models.signals.pre_migrate and post_migrate.",
  "sinks": "Modifies the receivers list of the migration signals to mute and restore them.",
  "flows": "Saves original receivers, clears the receiver lists, executes wrapped code, and restores the original receivers.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code performs standard signal management tasks without obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a context manager to mute migration signals by emptying the receivers list, and restores them afterward. This approach is common to prevent side effects during migrations. There are no suspicious or malicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or data leaks. The code’s intent appears to be safe and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code safely temporarily disables Django migration signals to prevent signal handlers from executing during specific operations. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
