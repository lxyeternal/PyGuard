{
  "purpose": "The code defines a context manager to temporarily disable Django migration signals (pre_migrate and post_migrate).",
  "sources": "Reads from pre_migrate.receivers and post_migrate.receivers to save and clear signal handlers.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data output or dangerous sink; primarily manipulates internal signal receiver lists.",
  "flows": "Saves original receivers, clears them, then restores them after context execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior observed. Functionality appears to be a standard signal management pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Django signal handling mechanisms to mute and restore migration signals within a context. No external inputs or outputs are involved. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code's purpose seems to be to prevent migration signals from triggering during certain operations, which is a common practice in Django projects for clean migrations or specific testing scenarios.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, non-malicious utility for managing Django signals during migrations. It does not exhibit any malware behavior or security risks.",
