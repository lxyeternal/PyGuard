  "purpose": "The code provides a context manager to temporarily mute Django migration signals (pre_migrate and post_migrate).",
  "sources": "The code reads signal receivers from django.db.models.signals pre_migrate and post_migrate.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leak points are present; the code only modifies signal receivers.",
  "flows": "The code saves current receivers, clears them, then restores them after the context block.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present; code performs a straightforward signal management.",
  "analysis": "The code cleanly implements a context manager to disable and then restore Django migration signals. It manipulates signal receiver lists to temporarily prevent migration signals from firing. No input validation, data leaks, or malicious actions are present. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility for controlling Django migration signals without any malicious intent or security risks.",
