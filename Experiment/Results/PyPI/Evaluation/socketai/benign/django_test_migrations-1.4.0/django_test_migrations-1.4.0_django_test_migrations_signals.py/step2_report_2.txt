  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms the code is a standard utility to mute Django migration signals.\n- No malicious activity or security risks identified.\n- Confidence is high (0.9), malware score is 0.\n- The reasoning is sound; no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizes standard pattern usage.\n- Slightly higher confidence (1), with a security risk score of 0.1, likely due to the act of manipulating internal signal handlers.\n- No malware or obfuscation concerns.\n- The analysis is consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Reinforces the standard utility nature.\n- Confidence at 1, malware at 0, security risk at 0.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behavior detected.\n- The reasoning aligns with typical Django signal management.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same conclusion: standard, safe, non-malicious.\n- Confidence at 1, malware at 0.\n- No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Again, confirms the utility's safety and standard behavior.\n- Slightly elevated security risk score (0.1), which might be due to the potential for misuse if someone maliciously manipulates signal handlers.\n- Malware score remains 0.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code presence:** The code is present and correctly implemented.\n- **Malware/malicious activity:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** Not present.\n- **Security risk:** Very low; manipulates internal signal handlers but in a controlled, standard manner.\n- **Logic and reasoning:** Consistent and sound.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The security risk score of 0.1 in some reports seems to reflect the potential misuse of signal handler manipulation, but since the code itself is benign and standard, this is acceptable.\n- The malware score should remain at 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (to reflect minimal potential for misuse, but overall safe)\n\nThis utility is a common pattern in Django projects for managing signals during migrations or testing, with no signs of malicious intent.",
