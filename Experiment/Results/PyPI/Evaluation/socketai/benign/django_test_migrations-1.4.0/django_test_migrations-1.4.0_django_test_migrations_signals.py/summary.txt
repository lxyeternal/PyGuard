  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for temporarily disabling Django migration signals. It does not contain malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1) are appropriate and justified."
