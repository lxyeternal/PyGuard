  "purpose": "The code provides a context manager to temporarily disable Django migration signals (pre_migrate and post_migrate).",
  "sources": "Reads signal receiver lists from django.db.models.signals.pre_migrate.receivers and post_migrate.receivers.",
  "targets": "Modifies the receivers lists to disable and restore signal handlers during the context.",
  "flows": "Stores original receivers, sets receivers to empty list to disable signals, then restores the original receivers after context.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The code safely manipulates Django migration signal receivers for temporary suppression, which is a common pattern for controlling signal handling during specific operations. It uses standard Django signal attributes and context management. No malicious or maliciously crafted code is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate utility for managing Django migration signals. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
