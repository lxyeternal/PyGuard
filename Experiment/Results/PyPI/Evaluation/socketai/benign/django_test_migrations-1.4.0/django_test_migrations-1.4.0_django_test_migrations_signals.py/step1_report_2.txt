  "purpose": "The code provides a context manager to temporarily disable Django migration signals.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'receivers' attribute of 'pre_migrate' and 'post_migrate' signals.",
  "sinks": "The code writes to the 'receivers' attribute of 'pre_migrate' and 'post_migrate' signals.",
  "flows": "The context manager saves original receivers, sets receivers to empty lists (disabling signals), then restores original receivers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behavior detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports. Usage of signal control is standard for testing or migration control.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future annotations, contextlib, and typing modules, then defines a context manager to mute Django migration signals by clearing their receivers and restoring them afterward. This pattern is common in Django testing or migration scenarios to prevent signal handlers from executing. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The logic is straightforward, with proper save-and-restore handling. The code does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or suspicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility to temporarily disable migration signals in Django and does not contain any malicious or security-risk behavior. It appears safe and legitimate.",
