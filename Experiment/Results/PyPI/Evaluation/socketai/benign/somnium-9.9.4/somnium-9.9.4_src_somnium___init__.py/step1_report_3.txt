{
  "purpose": "Importing the 'Somnium' class or function from a module named '__main__' within the same package.",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from .__main__ import Somnium'. This line reads the '__main__' module within the package.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network, file, or system commands are present in this line.",
  "flows": "The import statement itself does not establish data flow; it simply makes 'Somnium' available in the current module.",
  "anomalies": "The use of relative import from a module named '__main__' is unusual, as '__main__' is typically reserved for script entry points, not importable modules. This could indicate a non-standard structure or obfuscation, but alone, it does not imply malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple relative import from a module named '__main__'. This is unconventional because '__main__' is generally the name of a script executed directly, not a module meant to be imported. This could suggest an unusual project structure or potential obfuscation. No other code or context is provided, so no malicious behavior can be inferred from this line alone. The import itself does not perform any malicious actions, but its unconventional usage warrants further review if part of a larger codebase.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a minimal import statement with an atypical module reference. On its own, it does not contain malicious behavior. Its unusual structure suggests possible obfuscation or non-standard code organization, but there is no direct evidence of malicious intent based solely on this line.",
