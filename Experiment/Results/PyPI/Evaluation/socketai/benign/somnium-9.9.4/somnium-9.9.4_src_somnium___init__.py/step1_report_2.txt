{
  "purpose": "The code imports the 'Somnium' class or object from the __main__ module within the same package or directory.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from the local __main__ module in the package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling occurs within this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present in this minimal code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is very minimal, only performing an import. No suspicious activity or anomalies are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a symbol 'Somnium' from the __main__ module of the current package. This is a common pattern for organizing code within packages, especially when '__main__' contains main execution logic or core classes. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation. The code itself is straightforward and does not perform any operations beyond import.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a simple import statement with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It appears to be part of a larger codebase where 'Somnium' is used elsewhere.",
