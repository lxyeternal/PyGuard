  "purpose": "Import the 'Somnium' class or function from the '__main__' module within the same package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module '__main__'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or output functions present.",
  "flows": "The import flows from the local module '__main__' into the current module for use.",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative import ('from .__main__') is unusual but not inherently malicious; no suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated elements present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single import statement from a relative module. There are no additional code constructs, data handling, or execution logic. This import alone does not exhibit malicious behavior. The context of the '__main__' module is typical for Python packages that structure their main execution logic separately, and importing from it is standard practice. There are no indicators of malware, backdoors, or malicious data flows within this minimal snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard import from a local module '__main__'. There are no signs of malicious activity or security risks based on this single line. It appears to be a benign component of a larger codebase.",
