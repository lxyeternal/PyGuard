  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the provided scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports involve a simple import statement: `from .__main__ import Somnium` or similar.\n- The code snippets are minimal, with no additional logic, data handling, or execution.\n- The use of relative import from a module named `__main__` is highly unconventional because `__main__` typically indicates the script entry point, not an importable module.\n- None of the reports identify any malicious behavior, code obfuscation, or data leakage directly.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Summary:** Benign import from a local module, no anomalies.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The import is benign, and the high confidence is justified.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Summary:** Similar benign import, slightly more confident.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues detected.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Summary:** Unusual usage of relative import from `__main__`, possible structural oddity but no malicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 0.5\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n- **Assessment:** The unconventional import warrants a slightly higher suspicion but not enough to suggest malware. The security risk score of 0.2 seems reasonable, considering structural oddity but no direct threat.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Summary:** Same as above, noting unusual import from `__main__`.\n- **Confidence:** 0.6\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher confidence due to the unusual pattern, but still no malware. The security risk score could be marginally increased, but 0.1 is acceptable.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Summary:** Same as previous, low suspicion.\n- **Confidence:** 0.4\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable. The low confidence reflects the minimal suspicion.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of scores:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk Score | Justification |\n|---------|---------|--------------|--------------|----------------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0            | Benign import, no issues. |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0            | Same as above. |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0.2          | Unusual import pattern, but no malicious activity. |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0.1          | Slight suspicion due to structure, but no malware. |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0.2          | Similar reasoning. |\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation is evident.\n- **Risk scores:** Should reflect the suspicion level. The higher the suspicion due to unconventional import, the slightly higher the risk.\n\n### **Final recommendation:**\n\n- The current scores are reasonable and aligned with the analysis.\n- The only potential adjustment could be increasing the `securityRisk` slightly for reports 3, 4, and 5, but given the minimal code and lack of malicious indicators, the current scores are acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 for reports with unusual import patterns, which matches current scores.\n\n**Conclusion:** The current scoring is appropriate given the evidence. No significant changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The key point is that the import pattern is unconventional but not malicious. Continuous monitoring and contextual analysis are recommended if more code is available.",
