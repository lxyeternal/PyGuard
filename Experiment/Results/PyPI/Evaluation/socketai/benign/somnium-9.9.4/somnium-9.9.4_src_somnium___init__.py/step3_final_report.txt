{
  "purpose": "Import a class 'Somnium' from a relative module named '__main__'.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external sources involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions affecting system security.",
  "flows": "The import pulls 'Somnium' from the module '__main__'; no further data flow or execution path is evident.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual use of relative import from '__main__', which is typically the script entry point, not an importable module. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a single relative import from '__main__', which is unconventional but syntactically valid. The import alone does not indicate malicious intent. The pattern may suggest structural oddity or obfuscation, but no malicious activity, code injection, or data leakage is evident. The minimal code snippet limits the scope of analysis, but based on the available information, the code appears benign. The import's unconventional nature warrants a slight increase in security risk score but does not imply malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is unusual but benign. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to structural oddity rather than malicious intent. The code is safe for use, with a note to monitor for further suspicious patterns in the larger codebase.",
