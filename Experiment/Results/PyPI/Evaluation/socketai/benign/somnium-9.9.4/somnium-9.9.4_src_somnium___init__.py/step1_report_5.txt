{
  "purpose": "Import the 'Somnium' class or function from the '__main__' module within the same package.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module '__main__' to import 'Somnium'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external data transfer is visible.",
  "flows": "Import statement flows from local module '__main__' to the current namespace for use.",
  "anomalies": "The import from '__main__' in a package context is unusual; typically '__main__' is the entry point script, not a module to import from. This could indicate an unconventional structure or obfuscation, but not necessarily malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple import from a relative module named '__main__'. Normally, '__main__' is used as a script entry point, not as an importable module. This unusual usage might suggest an attempt to hide or complicate the code's structure, but with no additional context, it does not directly indicate malicious behavior. There are no other code parts, data handling, or external interactions present. As it stands, this is a minimal import statement with an unconventional module source, which could be suspicious in certain contexts but not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a single import from the '__main__' module, which is atypical. Without further context or additional code, it does not exhibit malicious behavior but warrants caution due to its unconventional structure. Overall, there is low suspicion based on this snippet alone.",
