{
  "purpose": "The code imports the 'Somnium' class or object from a module named '__main__', likely for use within a package or script.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing from __main__",
  "sinks": "None evident in the provided code snippet",
  "flows": "N/A, as there is no data flow or processing shown",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative import from __main__, which is unusual in packaged modules; could suggest obfuscation or improper packaging, but not malicious per se",
  "analysis": "The code snippet is minimal, only importing an object from __main__, which is typically the entry point of a script. This could indicate that the code is intended to run as a standalone script, or it might be part of a larger package. The presence of a relative import from __main__ is unconventional, as __main__ is usually the script executed directly, not imported as a module. No suspicious functions, data handling, or other indicators of malicious behavior are present. Without additional context or code, no malicious activity can be inferred.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is very minimal and does not demonstrate any malicious behavior or security issues. The use of relative import from __main__ is unusual but not malicious on its own. No malware signals or security risks are evident based solely on this snippet.",
