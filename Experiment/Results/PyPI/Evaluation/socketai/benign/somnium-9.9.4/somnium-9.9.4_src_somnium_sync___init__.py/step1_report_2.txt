{
  "purpose": "Import the 'Somnium' class or function from the local '__main__' module.",
  "sources": "The code reads the '__main__' module within the same package or directory.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows are present in this single import statement.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data movement is evident in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The import from '__main__' is unusual in modules but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "This code simply imports 'Somnium' from a module named '__main__' within the same package. The '__main__' module is typically used as an entry point for scripts and not usually imported from other modules. However, the snippet does not provide any malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious logic. There is no indication of data exfiltration, network activity, or obfuscation. The minimal nature of the code limits the scope of potential malicious activity but also means no malicious intent is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no evident malicious behavior or security risks. Its unusual import from '__main__' warrants awareness but does not pose a threat by itself.",
