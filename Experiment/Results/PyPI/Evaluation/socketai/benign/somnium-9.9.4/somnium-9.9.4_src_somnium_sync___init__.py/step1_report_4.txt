{
  "purpose": "The code imports the 'Somnium' class or object from the __main__ module within the same package.",
  "sources": "Import statement accessing the __main__ module in the current package",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "N/A - Only an import statement without data flow or execution logic",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative import from __main__ is unusual but not inherently malicious; no secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement importing 'Somnium' from the __main__ module within the same package. This is a standard import pattern, though importing from __main__ in a package is uncommon and may suggest unconventional module structuring. No data reading, no untrusted input handling, and no suspicious code execution present. No malware signatures or obfuscation detected. Limited context prevents full assessment of potential malicious intent, but based on this fragment alone, no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no apparent malicious behavior or security risks. Its unconventional use of __main__ as an import source is noted but not suspicious in itself. Overall, the code appears benign.",
