{
  "purpose": "The code imports the 'Somnium' class or function from the module '__main__', likely to be used within the current package or script.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing from __main__ module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or external data transmission present.",
  "flows": "No data flow observed; the code merely performs an import.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a relative import from __main__ is unusual and might indicate an attempt to obscure the source or behavior, but by itself, it's not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement importing 'Somnium' from the __main__ module. There are no additional operations, data handling, or external interactions. The import statement does not inherently imply malicious intent; however, importing from __main__ is uncommon outside of script entry points and may suggest unconventional packaging or execution context. Without additional context or code, there are no indicators of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no evident malicious intent or security risks. The only unusual aspect is importing from __main__, which may relate to how the package is structured but does not pose security concerns by itself.",
