{
  "purpose": "The code imports the 'Somnium' class or function from the '__main__' module within the same package or directory.",
  "sources": "Import statement indicates reading of the module '__main__' within the package; no direct input sources like user input or external data are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network, file, or system commands are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable from this single import statement; no source-to-sink flow is detectable.",
  "anomalies": "The import of '__main__' is unusual, as '__main__' typically refers to the main script in a package, not as an importable module. This could suggest unconventional design or potential obfuscation, but on its own, it does not indicate malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "This code simply imports 'Somnium' from a module named '__main__' in the same package. The use of '__main__' as a module name is uncommon and could be a sign of obfuscation or a non-standard code structure, but without additional context or code, no malicious activity can be inferred. There are no sources or sinks, and no apparent data flow or anomalies beyond the unusual module name.",
  "conclusion": "This single import statement is atypical but does not by itself suggest malicious behavior or security risks. It may be part of a larger, potentially obfuscated codebase, but based solely on this line, there are no indications of malicious intent.",
