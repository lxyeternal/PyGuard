{
  "purpose": "The code appears to import a class or object named 'Somnium' from a local module '__main__'. It likely aims to initialize or use this object within the package or script.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'Somnium' from a local module '__main__'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow points are present in this snippet; it's only an import statement.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable in this minimal code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The import is from a relative module named '__main__', which is unusual but not inherently malicious. The presence of a module named '__main__' is typically a special name in Python, used for entry points, but can be repurposed or misused. No other anomalies are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a single import statement, which is a standard Python practice. Importing from '__main__' as a module is uncommon but not suspicious on its own. No data is read from untrusted sources, and no functions or code execution occurs here. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign; it simply imports an object from a local module named '__main__'. There are no malicious behaviors, no security risks, and no obfuscation detected.",
