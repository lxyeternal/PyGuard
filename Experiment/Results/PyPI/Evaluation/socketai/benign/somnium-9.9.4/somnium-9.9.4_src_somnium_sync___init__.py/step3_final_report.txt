  "purpose": "Evaluate the provided import statement for potential malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external data sources or inputs are involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows are present; the code does not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is a simple import statement.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual import from '__main__', which is typically used as an entry point script, not as an importable module.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single import statement: 'from .__main__ import Somnium'. This is syntactically correct but unconventional, as '__main__' usually indicates the main script. No evidence of malicious activity, such as code execution, data exfiltration, or obfuscation, is present. The import does not involve any dynamic execution or hidden behaviors. The unusual module name may suggest unconventional packaging but does not imply malicious intent. Scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0.2, security risk: 0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of this snippet. The low malware and security risk scores are justified, and the slight suspicion due to the import source does not elevate concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign; the import from '__main__' is unconventional but not malicious. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected. The scores are appropriate and reflect minimal security concern.",
