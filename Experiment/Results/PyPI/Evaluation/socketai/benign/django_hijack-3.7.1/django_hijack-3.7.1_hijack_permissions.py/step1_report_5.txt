{
  "purpose": "The functions determine whether a hijacker can impersonate another user based on their roles and statuses.",
  "sources": "The function parameters 'hijacker' and 'hijacked' are sources where user objects are read to evaluate their roles and statuses.",
  "targets": "The return statements indicate the outcome of permission checks, which could influence access control mechanisms.",
  "flows": "User object properties (is_active, is_superuser, is_staff) flow from source parameters to conditional logic, resulting in a boolean decision.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code simply performs role-based permission checks; it appears standard and intended for access control.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions for role-based impersonation permissions. They evaluate user objects based on attributes like is_active, is_superuser, and is_staff. The logic aligns with typical authorization patterns. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious payloads are present. There are no signs of obfuscation or hidden behavior. The code is straightforward and serves a legitimate purpose in user permission management.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements standard role-based permission logic for user impersonation without any suspicious or malicious elements. It is secure and appropriate for access control within an application.",
