{
  "purpose": "The code defines functions to determine user impersonation permissions based on user roles such as superuser and staff.",
  "sources": "The functions read the 'hijacker' and 'hijacked' user objects, accessing properties like 'is_active', 'is_superuser', and 'is_staff'.",
  "sinks": "The functions return boolean values indicating permission, which could influence access control decisions in the application.",
  "flows": "Input data from 'hijacker' and 'hijacked' objects are evaluated through role-based conditions; the output influences authorization logic.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors are present. The code is straightforward role-based logic.",
  "analysis": "The code implements role-based impersonation logic, checking if 'hijacked' user is active and whether 'hijacker' has sufficient permissions. It uses simple conditionals without any dynamic execution or obfuscated code. No external data sources or insecure practices are involved. The logic aligns with standard permission checks, and no malicious behavior or security flaws are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of role-based permission checks for user impersonation. It does not contain malware or security risks, and appears to be a benign component of access control logic.",
