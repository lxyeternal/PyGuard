{
  "purpose": "The code defines two functions that determine whether a user (hijacker) is permitted to impersonate another user (hijacked) based on their roles and statuses.",
  "sources": "The code reads attributes from 'hijacker' and 'hijacked' objects, specifically 'is_active', 'is_superuser', and 'is_staff'.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct data outputs or external calls; the functions return boolean values based on user attributes, with no evident untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "Input attributes from user objects are checked against conditions and lead to boolean return values indicating impersonation permissions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. The functions appear straightforward and role-based.",
  "analysis": "The code verifies user roles and statuses to determine impersonation permissions. It employs simple, explicit role checks without external input, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated logic. No malicious code, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The functions are role-based access controls, typical in user permission systems. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data flows.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements standard role-based impersonation checks without any malicious behavior or security risks. It is straightforward and appears secure within its scope.",
