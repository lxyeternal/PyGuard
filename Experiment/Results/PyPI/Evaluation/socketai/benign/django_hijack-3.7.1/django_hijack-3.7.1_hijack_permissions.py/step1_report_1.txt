{
  "purpose": "The code defines authorization functions to determine if a 'hijacker' can impersonate a 'hijacked' user based on their roles and activity status.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the parameters 'hijacker' and 'hijacked', specifically their 'is_active', 'is_superuser', and 'is_staff' attributes.",
  "sinks": "The functions return boolean values indicating permission to impersonate, which could influence access control decisions in a broader application context.",
  "flows": "Input attributes ('is_active', 'is_superuser', 'is_staff') are checked and combined logically to determine authorization; these control the output decision regarding impersonation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs detected. No external data sources or sinks like network calls or file access are present.",
  "analysis": "The functions perform role-based authorization logic to permit or deny impersonation. They correctly handle null or inactive user states, ensuring only active users with appropriate roles can impersonate others. The code relies on user role attributes and activity status without external data dependencies. No malicious or suspicious behavior identified, and the logic aligns with standard role-based access controls.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to implement straightforward, role-based impersonation logic without malicious intent or security flaws. It does not include any malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. Overall, it is a simple, role-checking utility with no security concerns based on the provided code.",
