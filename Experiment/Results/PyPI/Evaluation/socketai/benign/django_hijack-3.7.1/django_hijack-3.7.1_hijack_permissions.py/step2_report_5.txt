  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the logic, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is straightforward role-based access control logic.\n- No obfuscation, external data sources, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n- The functions rely solely on user attributes (`is_active`, `is_superuser`, `is_staff`) to determine impersonation permissions.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correctly describes the code's intent.\n- **Findings:** No issues; logic aligns with standard role checks.\n- **Scores:** `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, `securityRisk: 0` — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Similar to Report 1, accurate.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, `securityRisk: 0.1` — slightly above zero, but considering the context, acceptable.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — reasonable.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- Same as above; consistent assessment.\n- **Scores:** All zero for malware and obfuscation.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- Same conclusion.\n- **Scores:** All appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- Similar findings.\n- Slightly higher `securityRisk: 0.2`, but still consistent with benign code.\n\n---\n\n### Are the scores reasonable?\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, correct.\n- **Security risk:** Slight variations (0.1 to 0.2) are acceptable given the code's simplicity; however, since the code is benign, these could be lowered to 0.\n\n### Should any scores be adjusted?\n- **Malware:** No change needed.\n- **Obfuscated:** No change needed.\n- **Security risk:** Given the benign, straightforward code, all could be set to **0** for consistency and accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is **not malicious**, **not obfuscated**, and **poses no security risk**.\n- The role checks are standard and safe.\n- The slight non-zero security risk scores are overestimations.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese reflect the actual analysis that the code is benign and secure.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Lower the `securityRisk` scores in all reports to **0**.\n- Confirm that the malware and obfuscated scores remain at **0**.\n\nThis provides a consistent, accurate security assessment based on the code provided.",
