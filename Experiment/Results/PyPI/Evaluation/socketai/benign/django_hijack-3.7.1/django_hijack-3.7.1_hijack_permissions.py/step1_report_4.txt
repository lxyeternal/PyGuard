{
  "purpose": "The code defines authorization functions to determine whether a user (hijacker) is permitted to impersonate another user (hijacked) based on their permissions levels (superuser, staff, active status).",
  "sources": "The data is read from the 'hijacker' and 'hijacked' objects, specifically their 'is_active', 'is_superuser', and 'is_staff' attributes.",
  "sinks": "The functions return boolean values that determine access control, which influence whether impersonation is permitted.",
  "flows": "The functions evaluate attributes of 'hijacker' and 'hijacked' objects to determine if impersonation is allowed, based on the user's permissions and active status.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious strings, or malicious code behaviors are present. The code uses straightforward logical checks for permission validation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs permission-based checks to allow or deny user impersonation based on user roles and statuses. It does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications. The logic appears consistent with standard access control functions. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behavior indicators are present. It solely depends on user attributes, with no external data inputs or outputs that could be exploited maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides standard permission logic for user impersonation scenarios, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a typical implementation of role-based access control, with no evidence of sabotage or malware.",
