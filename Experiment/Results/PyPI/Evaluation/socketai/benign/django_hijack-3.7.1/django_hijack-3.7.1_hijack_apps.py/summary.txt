  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard Django configuration with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The only potential concern is the naming 'hijack,' which does not translate into actual risk. The assigned scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0 and a very low risk score (~0.1) reflecting the suspicious name but no actual threat."
