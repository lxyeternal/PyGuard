  "purpose": "Define a Django application configuration named 'Hijack' with static attributes.",
  "sources": "Static attributes 'name' and 'verbose_name' within the class; no external data or input handling.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or external communication points.",
  "flows": "None; the code does not process or transfer data dynamically.",
  "anomalies": "The class name 'HijackConfig' and app name 'hijack' could be contextually suspicious but do not indicate malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, straightforward Django AppConfig subclass with static attributes. No input, output, or external communication is present. The only notable aspect is the naming, which could be suspicious in certain contexts but is not inherently malicious. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, assigning malware scores of 0 and low security risk scores. The code's simplicity and clarity justify high confidence in benign classification. The naming may warrant contextual caution but does not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard Django configuration with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The only potential concern is the naming 'hijack,' which does not translate into actual risk. The assigned scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0 and a very low risk score (~0.1) reflecting the suspicious name but no actual threat.",
