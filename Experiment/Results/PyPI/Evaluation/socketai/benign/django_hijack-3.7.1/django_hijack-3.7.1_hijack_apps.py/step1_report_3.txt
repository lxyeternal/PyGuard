  "purpose": "Define Django application configuration for the 'hijack' app",
  "sources": "No input or data reading points; static code defining class and attributes",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data leaks or external effects",
  "flows": "No data flow; code is static class definition",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definition with no suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports AppConfig from django.apps and defines a class HijackConfig with name and verbose_name attributes. There are no inputs, data processing, external communications, or dynamic behaviors. The class appears to be a standard Django app configuration, with a name that could be innocuous or suspicious depending on context, but nothing in the code itself indicates malicious intent. No secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django application configuration class with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The name 'hijack' alone could be suspicious in context, but based solely on this code snippet, it appears benign.",
