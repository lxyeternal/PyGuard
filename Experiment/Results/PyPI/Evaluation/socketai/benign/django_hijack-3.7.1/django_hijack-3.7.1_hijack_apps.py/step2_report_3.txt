  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a minimal Django AppConfig subclass with static attributes.\n- None mention any actual dynamic behavior, external data handling, or code execution.\n- The only potentially suspicious aspect is the use of the term \"hijack\" in the app name, which could be contextually malicious, but the code itself does not implement any malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The **original code** matches the described code in all reports.\n- There are **no errors, flaws, or obfuscation** present.\n- The code is **benign and standard** for Django applications.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- No mistakes or errors are evident in the reports.\n- The reports correctly state that the code is straightforward and does not perform any malicious activity.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the code being clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk score:** Mostly very low (0 or 0.1), which is appropriate since the code is benign.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- The only concern is the app name \"hijack,\" which could be suspicious in certain contexts, but since the code is static and does not perform any malicious actions, this is a contextual concern, not a technical one.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- No changes needed to the scores; they are consistent with the code and analysis.\n- The high confidence scores (1.0 or 0.9) are justified based on the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Estimated malware score:** 0  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Estimated risk score:** 0.1 (to reflect the potentially suspicious name but no actual risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, with no malware or obfuscation, and minimal security risk. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is a standard Django AppConfig subclass with no malicious or obfuscated elements.  \n- The only mild concern is the app name \"hijack,\" but it does not translate into any actual security threat.  \n- The current scores are reasonable and should remain as is.",
