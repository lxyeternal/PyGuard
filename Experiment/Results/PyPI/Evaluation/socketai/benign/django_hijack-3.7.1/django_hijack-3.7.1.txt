The only potential concern is the naming 'hijack,' which does not translate into actual risk. The assigned scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0 and a very low risk score (~0.1) reflecting the suspicious name but no actual threat."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of user impersonation in Django, with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The primary security concern lies in ensuring that the permission check function and session data are properly configured and protected. The risk score is low (~0.2-0.3), primarily due to reliance on external configuration for permission checks and dynamic imports."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for temporarily disconnecting and reconnecting Django signals, with a minor logical flaw in tracking connection status. It does not contain malicious behavior. The scores should reflect no malware, no obfuscation, and a very low security risk (around 0.2) due to the logical flaw, not malicious intent."

The minor concern about the module name 'hijack' does not translate into actual security risk based solely on this snippet. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity."
