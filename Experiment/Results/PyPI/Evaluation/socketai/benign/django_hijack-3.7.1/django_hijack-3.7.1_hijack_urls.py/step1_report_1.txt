{
  "purpose": "Defines URL routing for the 'hijack' app, mapping URLs to views for acquiring and releasing users.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; URL patterns are statically defined.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data output points; primarily URL configuration.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; static routing setup.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or suspicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports URL configuration functions and views, then sets up two URL patterns linked to class-based views. There are no inputs, data processing, or output operations that could be exploited or malicious. The code appears to be standard Django URL routing without obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward URL configuration for a Django application with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a typical, benign routing setup.",
