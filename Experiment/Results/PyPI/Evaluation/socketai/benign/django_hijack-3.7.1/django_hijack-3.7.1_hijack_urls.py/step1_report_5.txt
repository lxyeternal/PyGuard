  "purpose": "Defines URL patterns for 'hijack' app in a Django project, mapping URLs to views.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading present in the code.",
  "sinks": "URL pattern definitions are not directly a sink for untrusted data; potential impact depends on the views.",
  "flows": "URL patterns map incoming requests to view methods; potential source-to-sink flow depends on view implementations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Django URL configuration with no input handling, data processing, or security-sensitive operations. It references views that might handle sensitive logic, but based solely on this snippet, there are no signs of malicious intent. The code structure is standard, with no signs of obfuscation or unusual patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard URL routing configuration with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet. The security posture depends on the implementation of the referenced views, which are not provided.",
