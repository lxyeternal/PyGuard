  "purpose": "Define URL routes for the 'hijack' Django app, mapping 'acquire/' and 'release/' endpoints to class-based views.",
  "sources": "Import statements for URL routing and views; URL pattern definitions.",
  "sinks": "Mapping URLs to views; potential for untrusted data handling depends on view implementations, not shown here.",
  "flows": "URL requests to 'acquire/' and 'release/' paths are directed to corresponding views; actual data flow depends on view logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward. The module name 'hijack' could be considered suspicious but does not indicate malicious activity by itself.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django URL configuration with two URL patterns. No embedded logic, secrets, or obfuscation are present. The views' internal implementations are unknown, so security implications cannot be fully assessed, but the URL routing itself is benign. All reports correctly identify the code as non-malicious, assigning malware and obfuscation scores of 0, and very low security risk scores (~0.1). Confidence levels are high (≥0.8). The naming 'hijack' may raise concern but does not imply malicious intent without further context. Overall, the code is safe and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward Django URL configuration with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The minor concern about the module name 'hijack' does not translate into actual security risk based solely on this snippet. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity.",
