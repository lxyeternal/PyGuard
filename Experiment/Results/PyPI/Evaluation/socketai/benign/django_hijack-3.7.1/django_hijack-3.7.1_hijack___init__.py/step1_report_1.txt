{
  "purpose": "The code appears to facilitate user impersonation or login as another user, possibly for administrative or support purposes.",
  "sources": "Import from a local module '_version' to retrieve version information.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data outputs that could lead to data leaks or security effects are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving user input or untrusted data; primarily setting version variables.",
  "anomalies": "The comment indicates a functionality for user hijacking, which is inherently sensitive and potentially malicious if misused. The code itself does not implement the actual hijacking but suggests capability. No actual code for login or impersonation is present here.",
  "analysis": "The code imports version information from a local module '_version' and assigns it to module-level variables. The comment suggests that the overall system may support user hijacking, but this fragment does not contain any implementation of such functionality. The presence of this comment alone is not malicious but indicates that the larger codebase may include features that enable user impersonation. There are no security issues, input handling, or suspicious behaviors in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment does not exhibit malicious behavior by itself. It primarily manages version info and hints at user impersonation capabilities elsewhere. No malicious code, data leakage, or security risks are evident here.",
