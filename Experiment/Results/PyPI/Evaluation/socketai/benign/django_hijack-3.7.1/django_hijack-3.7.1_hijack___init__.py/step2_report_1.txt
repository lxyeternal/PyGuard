  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and the code snippet to assess the actual security implications.\n\n**Code Summary:**\nThe provided code only imports version information from a local module `_version` and assigns it to module-level variables. The comment suggests that the broader system may support user impersonation or hijacking, but this snippet itself contains no such functionality.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Issue Presence & Functionality**\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  No. The code does not implement or reveal any user hijacking or impersonation features. The comment is merely a description, not an active component.\n\n### 2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes**\n- The comment about enabling user hijacking is **potentially misleading** or **misplaced** since the code only manages version info.\n- No actual code for security-critical operations exists here, so no logical flaws are present within this fragment.\n\n### 3. **Score Review & Justification**\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate. There is no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Security Risk Score:**  \n  The scores are low (mostly 0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal risk. Given the code's simplicity, this is reasonable.\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  All reports indicate 0, correctly noting no obfuscation.\n\n### 4. **Assessment of the Comments and Potential Risks**\n- The comments referencing user hijacking **do not** correspond to any actual implementation in the code. They may suggest planned features or be remnants from elsewhere.\n- **Caution:** While the comments are suspicious, the code itself is benign. The comments alone do not justify higher risk scores.\n\n### 5. **Consistency & Recommendations**\n- The scores are consistent with the code and comments.\n- Given the comments' potential to mislead, it would be prudent to **review the larger codebase** for actual impersonation or security features.\n- No changes to scores are necessary based solely on this fragment.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Assessment:**\n\n| Aspect                  | Score / Justification                                                                                         |\n|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Malware**            | 0 — No malicious code or behavior present.                                                                 |\n| **Obfuscated**         | 0 — Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.                                                        |\n| **Risk**               | 0.1–0.2 — Minimal risk; the comment is suspicious but the code is benign. No active security issues.     |\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**  \nThis code snippet is benign, purely manages version info, and contains no active or latent malicious functionality. The comments referencing user hijacking are likely misplaced or misleading but do not impact security in this context.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code does **not** implement or enable user impersonation.  \n- The comments are suspicious but do **not** reflect actual behavior.  \n- Scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nReview the entire codebase for actual impersonation features, but based on this snippet alone, there is no security concern.",
