  "purpose": "To set and expose version information for a Python package.",
  "sources": "Importing _version module and accessing its attributes (__version__, version_tuple)",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data handling or output occurs",
  "flows": "Importing version data from _version, assigning to module-level variables",
  "anomalies": "The comment suggests a functionality related to user hijacking, but the actual code only deals with version info; no suspicious or malicious behavior present",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local _version module and assigns its attributes to variables for package versioning. Despite the comment about user hijacking, there is no implementation of such functionality here. The code is straightforward and appears to be solely for version management. No sensitive data handling, input/output, or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and related solely to version information. The comment appears misleading or out of context; there is no evidence of malicious behavior or functionality for hijacking users.",
