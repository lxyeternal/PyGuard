{
  "purpose": "This code appears to set version information for a Python package or module, with a comment suggesting it enables user impersonation or hijacking.",
  "sources": "The code imports a local module '_version' to access version information.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data, user input, or sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "The code reads version data from '_version' and assigns it to variables; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The comment describing 'Enable users to hijack (=login as) and work on behalf of another user' is suspicious and potentially malicious, as it indicates user impersonation capability. The code itself does not implement such functionality, but the comment suggests intent or planned features.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports version information from a local module and assigns it to variables. There is no functional implementation of user hijacking, login, or impersonation within this snippet. The comment is potentially malicious or misleading, possibly indicating intent to implement user impersonation. Overall, the code is minimal and does not contain malicious code, but the comment raises concern about intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself does not perform any malicious actions, but the comment about user hijacking is suspicious and could indicate malicious intent if part of a larger codebase. No actual malicious behavior is evident in this snippet, but the comment warrants caution.",
