  "purpose": "The code manages version information for the package, with no active functionality related to user impersonation or hijacking.",
  "sources": "Import of the _version module and assignment of its attributes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The code only assigns version info; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The comment suggests user hijacking capability, which is not implemented; potential misleading documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, only importing version info. The comment about enabling user hijacking is not reflected in the code, indicating either incomplete implementation or misleading documentation. No malicious code, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities are present. The malware score is correctly 0, obfuscation is absent, and the security risk score is low, reflecting the lack of active malicious behavior but noting the suspicious comment. Confidence is high that the code is benign; the comment's intent should be clarified in the broader codebase.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign, managing version info without any malicious or security-sensitive functionality. The suspicious comment does not impact security assessment but warrants review in the larger context. Scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
