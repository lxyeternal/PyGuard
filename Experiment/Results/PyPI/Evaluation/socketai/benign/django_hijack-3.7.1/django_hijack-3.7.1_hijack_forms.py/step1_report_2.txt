{
  "purpose": "Define classes for managing static assets, particularly JavaScript files, for inclusion in Django templates.",
  "sources": "Input: 'path' parameter in Asset and ESM classes; use of 'static' function from django.templatetags.static.",
  "sinks": "HTML output in __str__ methods, which generate script tags or URLs; potential injection if 'path' is malicious or improperly sanitized.",
  "flows": "Input 'path' → 'absolute_path' method → potential URL or static path resolution → HTML rendering via format_html in __str__ methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. Use of 'format_html' properly escapes output; no suspicious URL patterns or code injection points.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for handling static assets in Django templates. The 'Asset' class normalizes URLs and static paths, while 'ESM' extends it for JavaScript modules. Usage of 'format_html' ensures safe HTML output. No malicious behaviors, suspicious logic, or obfuscation detected. The data flow from input to HTML rendering appears standard and secure. The only consideration is ensuring 'path' inputs are sanitized when instantiated, but the code relies on the user to provide appropriate paths.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation for managing static assets in Django templates. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks as written. The use of Django's safe formatting functions further mitigates injection risks.",
