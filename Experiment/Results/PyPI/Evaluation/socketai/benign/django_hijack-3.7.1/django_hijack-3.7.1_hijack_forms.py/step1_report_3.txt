  "purpose": "Defines asset classes for including static files and JavaScript modules in Django templates.",
  "sources": "Initialization of Asset with a file path, usage of the 'static' function for path resolution.",
  "sinks": "HTML rendering functions (format_html), string representations of Asset and ESM objects.",
  "flows": "Asset.__str__() calls absolute_path() -> static() or returns input if URL, then ESM.__str__() renders a script tag with the resolved path.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious network connections, and no obfuscated code. The code correctly uses safe functions for HTML rendering.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for managing static asset references in Django templates. Asset class ensures proper path handling, avoiding path injection issues by resolving relative paths via 'static()' only when needed. ESM class extends Asset to generate script tags for JavaScript modules. No suspicious, malicious, or maliciously obfuscated behavior is observed. The code uses standard Django functions for safety and proper HTML rendering.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate and safe implementation for managing static assets in Django templates. No malicious or security-compromising behavior is detected.",
