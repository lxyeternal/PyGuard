  "purpose": "Manage static asset URLs and generate safe HTML tags for inclusion in Django templates, handling absolute URLs, local paths, and static files.",
  "sources": "Input 'path' parameter in Asset and ESM classes, URL checks in absolute_path method.",
  "sinks": "HTML output via format_html in __str__ methods, which escapes inputs to prevent injection.",
  "flows": "Input 'path' → absolute_path() URL validation → __str__() rendering HTML with format_html() → safe HTML output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; reliance on user-provided 'path' is standard but could be misused if malicious input is supplied.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly distinguishes absolute URLs, local paths, and static assets, using Django's functions to ensure safe HTML rendering. No malicious, obfuscated, or vulnerable code is present. The path validation is appropriate, and the use of format_html mitigates injection risks. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and aligns with best practices. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's behavior and pose minimal threat. The main concern is the trust in user input for 'path', but given the URL checks and safe rendering, this is acceptable. Overall, the code is safe, with negligible security risk, and no modifications are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure implementation for static asset management in Django templates. It handles URLs properly, uses safe HTML functions, and does not contain malicious or obfuscated code. The assigned scores are justified, and the overall security posture is high.",
