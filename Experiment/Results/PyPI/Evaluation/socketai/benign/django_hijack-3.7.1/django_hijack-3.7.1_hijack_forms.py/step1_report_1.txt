  "purpose": "Define classes for handling static assets, specifically JavaScript modules, in Django templates.",
  "sources": "Input is from the constructor parameter 'path' when creating Asset or ESM instances.",
  "sinks": "The code generates HTML script tags with asset URLs, which could be exploited if 'path' contains malicious data.",
  "flows": "Input 'path' -> absolute_path() method -> __str__() in ESM -> format_html() generating script tag.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Use of Django's static and format_html functions is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily creates asset objects for use in templates, sanitizing paths via absolute_path(). The absolute_path() method returns the provided URL if it starts with 'http://', 'https://', or '/', else it calls Django's static() function. The static() function resolves static file URLs, which is standard in Django. The __str__() method in ESM outputs a safe HTML script tag for module-type scripts. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling found. The flow from user input (asset path) to HTML output appears safe under normal use, assuming proper usage of the static() function and provided paths.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for handling static assets in Django templates with no evident malicious intent or security flaws. It securely generates HTML tags for assets, with proper path handling. No malware or suspicious activity detected.",
