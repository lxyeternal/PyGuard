{
  "purpose": "Define classes for managing and rendering static asset paths in Django templates, specifically for general assets and JavaScript ESM modules.",
  "sources": "The 'path' parameter provided during Asset and ESM instantiation.",
  "sinks": "The __str__ methods, especially in ESM, where HTML is generated with potential for injection if 'path' is malicious.",
  "flows": "Input 'path' -> 'absolute_path' method -> '__str__' method -> HTML output in ESM.__str__",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. Usage of standard Django functions and safe HTML formatting. No dynamic code execution or external data fetching observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for assets with methods to generate safe HTML snippets. The 'absolute_path' method handles URL validation, allowing absolute URLs or local paths, and appends static URL prefix otherwise. The ESM class outputs a script tag with type='module'. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, code injection, or data leakage. Usage of 'format_html' suggests built-in safety against injection. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward utility for rendering static assets in templates, with no suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for managing static assets in Django templates with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It safely generates HTML snippets for assets, including JavaScript modules.",
