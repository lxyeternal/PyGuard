  "purpose": "Define and store version information for a Python package generated by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string and version tuple variables; reading of the 'version' string.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data leakage or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Assignment of version string to version variables; no untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no anomalies or suspicious code patterns; it is a standard versioning snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward versioning module typically generated by setuptools_scm. It conditionally imports typing constructs if type checking is enabled, and assigns version-related variables accordingly. There are no inputs, no untrusted data handling, and no code execution beyond simple variable assignments. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard versioning snippet with no malicious intent or security risks. It merely defines version information for a package.",
