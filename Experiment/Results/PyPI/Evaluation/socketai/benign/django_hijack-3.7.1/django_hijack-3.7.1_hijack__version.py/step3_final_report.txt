  "purpose": "This code defines version information variables for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, with no dynamic behavior or external data handling.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of version string and version tuple; conditional import for type hints.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "N/A; static data assignments without data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward, auto-generated version info code with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, auto-generated module setting version variables, with a conditional import for type checking. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0. The code's simplicity and purpose do not pose security concerns. The version string is hardcoded, which is standard for such files, and does not impact security. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static version information module with no malicious or security risks. All reports' assessments are accurate and consistent. No further action or modifications are necessary.",
