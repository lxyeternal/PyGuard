  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward, static version information module generated by setuptools_scm.\n- No dynamic code, external data input, or network activity is present.\n- No suspicious or obfuscated code patterns are identified.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- The purpose is solely to define version variables, with no security risks or malicious behavior.\n\n**Specific observations:**\n- The code does not contain any logic that could be exploited or that behaves maliciously.\n- The use of `TYPE_CHECKING` and static assignment is standard practice.\n- The version string is hardcoded, which is typical and not inherently risky.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1, which seems justified.\n- Obfuscated score is 0 across the board, consistent with the clear, non-obfuscated code.\n- Malware score is 0, correctly reflecting the absence of malicious activity.\n- Security risk is 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- None identified. The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The reasoning is sound, and the conclusion that this code is benign is correct.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is straightforward, no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk, static version info)\n\n**Final thoughts:**\nThis code is a standard, autogenerated version info module with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and well-reasoned.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign.\n- Scores are appropriate.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nI concur with the reports' assessments. The code is safe, with no malicious intent or security issues.",
