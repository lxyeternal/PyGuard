{
  "purpose": "Define version information for the package, generated by setuptools_scm, with no operational or security-related function.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string and tuple, importing type hints when TYPE_CHECKING is True.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static assignment of version info only.",
  "flows": "None, as code only assigns static version data without processing external input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and static, with no suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code sets version-related variables for a Python package, using conditional type hint imports and static version assignments. There are no external data inputs, no processing of untrusted data, and no code that could be malicious. It is a standard autogenerated version file with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, autogenerated version descriptor with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
