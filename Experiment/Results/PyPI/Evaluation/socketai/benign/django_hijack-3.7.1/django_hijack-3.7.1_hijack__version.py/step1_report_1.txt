{
  "purpose": "Defines version information for a Python package using setuptools_scm, without executing or importing external or dynamic code.",
  "sources": "Static string assignment for __version__, __version_tuple__, version, and version_tuple",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input or lead to data leaks",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code only assigns static values",
  "anomalies": "Contains a typical pattern for version assignment; no unusual code patterns or obfuscated logic; the TYPE_CHECKING conditional is standard for type hints",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward version info module, primarily assigning static version strings and tuples. It conditionally imports typing annotations for type checking but does not perform any dynamic code execution, I/O, network operations, or data manipulation. There are no signs of malicious behavior or hidden backdoors. The only potential concern is the version string being hardcoded, but this is standard practice for package metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version information module with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply defines package version variables statically and conditionally imports type hints, which is typical for this context.",
