  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to verify the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and any potential concerns.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward, static version information module generated by setuptools_scm.\n- No dynamic code, external inputs, or data flows are identified.\n- No suspicious or obfuscated patterns are reported or evident.\n- The code is standard, benign, and serves a metadata purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code correctness:** The code correctly assigns static version strings and tuples, with a conditional import for type hints. No issues with the code's logic or syntax.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None of the reports indicate or suggest any malicious activity. The code does not perform network operations, execute untrusted code, or handle sensitive data.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; the code is clear and generated by a common tool.\n\n### Scoring evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign `0`, which aligns with the analysis. No evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign `0`, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** All assign `0` or `0.5`. Given the code's benign nature, a risk score of `0` is appropriate.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- The reports are thorough and consistent. They correctly identify that the code is a standard version info module with no security risks.\n- No report suggests any suspicious logic or hidden backdoors.\n- The only minor note is that the version string is hardcoded, but this is typical and not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Scores:** The scores assigned in all reports seem appropriate and reasonable.\n- **Risk assessment:** Since the code is static, benign, and auto-generated, a risk score of **0** is justified.\n- **Malware and obfuscated scores:** Correctly set to **0**.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, auto-generated version metadata module with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action needed.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always ensure that the version string remains accurate and updated during releases, but this does not impact security directly.",
