  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a package, generated by setuptools_scm, to facilitate version tracking and management.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string and tuple variables; import statement within TYPE_CHECKING conditional",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static assignment only",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; version variables are statically assigned",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or hidden behavior",
  "analysis": "The code sets version information using static strings and tuples, with a conditional import used solely for type checking. There are no external inputs, no network connections, or dynamic code execution. The purpose is to provide version metadata, and it appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version declaration generated by setuptools_scm. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
