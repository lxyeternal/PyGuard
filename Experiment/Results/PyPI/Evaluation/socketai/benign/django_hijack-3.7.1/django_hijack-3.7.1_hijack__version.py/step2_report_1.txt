  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - The code is a typical autogenerated version info module, assigning static version strings and tuples.\n   - It uses a conditional `TYPE_CHECKING` import for type hints, which is standard practice.\n   - No dynamic code execution, no external input, no network calls, and no obfuscation are present.\n   - The version string `'3.7.1'` is hardcoded, which is common in such files.\n\n2. **Assessment of Report Validity and Logic:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is static, straightforward, and generated by `setuptools_scm`.\n   - They note the absence of malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n   - The analysis in each report is consistent and aligns with standard practices for version files.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign `0`, which is appropriate. The code shows no signs of malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign `0`, which is correct given the clarity and simplicity.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign `0` or `0.5`. Since there's no malicious or risky behavior, a score of `0` is justified.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns:**\n   - The only minor concern could be the hardcoded version string, but this is standard and not a security risk.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified here; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any risky operations.\n\n5. **Overall Evaluation:**\n   - The code is benign, standard, and generated by a common tool.\n   - The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and justified.\n   - No changes are necessary to the scores or conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### My own estimate:\nGiven the analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is a typical, safe version info module with no malicious intent or security concerns.\n\n**Final scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is entirely benign.",
