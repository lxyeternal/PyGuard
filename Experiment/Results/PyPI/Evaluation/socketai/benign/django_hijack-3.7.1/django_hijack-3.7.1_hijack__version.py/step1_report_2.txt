  "purpose": "Define version information for the package using setuptools_scm generated code.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string and tuple, and conditional import statements.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow from source to sink, only internal variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets version-related variables and type hints, with a conditional import block based on TYPE_CHECKING. The version string and tuple are hardcoded to specific values. There are no external data inputs, no network calls, or sensitive operations. The code appears to be auto-generated by setuptools_scm for versioning purposes, following standard practices. No malicious or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version declaration segment generated by a standard tool. It contains no malicious intent, suspicious behaviors, or security risks.",
