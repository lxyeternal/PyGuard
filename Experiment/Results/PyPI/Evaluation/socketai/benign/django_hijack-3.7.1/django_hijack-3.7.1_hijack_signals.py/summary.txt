  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for temporarily disconnecting and reconnecting Django signals, with a minor logical flaw in tracking connection status. It does not contain malicious behavior. The scores should reflect no malware, no obfuscation, and a very low security risk (around 0.2) due to the logical flaw, not malicious intent."
