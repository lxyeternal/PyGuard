  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Middleware injects hijack notification HTML into responses, reads session hijack history, user attributes, and request headers.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious code, no external network activity, no obfuscation. The injection is controlled and based on session data.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem appropriate. The risk score is low because the code only modifies responses for specific conditions.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on session data and response modification.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious activity, no external calls, no obfuscation. It’s standard middleware.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focuses on hijack detection and notification injection, similar to others.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity, no external network access, no obfuscation. The code is safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same general purpose, with similar data flows.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, no external calls, standard Django practices.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern—inject notification HTML based on session and headers.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious activity, no obfuscation, no external network connections.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code or activity. The code is a typical middleware pattern for UI notification injection.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are zero, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** The highest risk stems from potential HTML injection, but since the injection is controlled and based on safe, known parameters, the low risk score of 0.2 is justified. It’s a benign UI enhancement, not a security vulnerability.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent and reasonable across all reports.\n- No changes needed; the analysis aligns with the code’s behavior.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or high security risk.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (low, controlled HTML injection, no external threats)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, benign Django middleware for user hijack notification, with no security or malware concerns.",
