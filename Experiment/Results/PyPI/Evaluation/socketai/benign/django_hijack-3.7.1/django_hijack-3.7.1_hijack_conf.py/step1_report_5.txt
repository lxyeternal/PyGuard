  "purpose": "Define a lazy-loaded settings object that proxies access to Django's settings module, adding specific default attributes.",
  "sources": "Importing django.conf.settings, accessing attributes via __getattribute__",
  "sinks": "Attribute access on django_settings object, potentially exposing sensitive data if misused",
  "flows": "Access to LazySettings attributes -> __getattribute__ -> getattr(django_settings) -> returns attribute value",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; use of __getattribute__ is standard for proxying, no suspicious patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines a LazySettings class that proxies attribute access to Django's settings module, providing default values for certain attributes. It does not contain any hardcoded secrets, malicious logic, or suspicious behavior. The usage of __getattribute__ is typical for creating proxy objects. There are no signs of data leakage, external communications, or malicious backdoors. The code appears to be a benign utility for managing configuration access.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pattern for lazy or proxy settings with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
