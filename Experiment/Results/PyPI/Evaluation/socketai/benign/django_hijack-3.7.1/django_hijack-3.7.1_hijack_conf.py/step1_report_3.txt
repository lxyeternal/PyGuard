{
  "purpose": "Define a lazy-loading settings wrapper that retrieves attributes from Django's settings module, with some default constants.",
  "sources": "Access to django_settings via __getattribute__, which retrieves attributes from the imported Django settings module.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; code only accesses attributes from Django's settings module.",
  "flows": "Attribute access on the 'settings' object flows to django_settings if the attribute exists; otherwise, it falls back to default values or super().__getattribute__.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a custom LazySettings class to delegate attribute access, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a LazySettings class that forwards attribute access to Django's global settings object, with fallback defaults for specific attributes. The only constants are string identifiers or HTML tags, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration observed. The pattern appears to facilitate flexible configuration access but does not introduce malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign wrapper around Django settings with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It employs a common lazy-loading pattern without suspicious operations.",
