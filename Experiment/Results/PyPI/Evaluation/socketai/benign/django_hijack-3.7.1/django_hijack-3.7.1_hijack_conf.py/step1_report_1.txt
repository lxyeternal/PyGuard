  "purpose": "Provide a lazy proxy for Django settings with predefined attribute defaults.",
  "sources": "django.conf import of settings as django_settings",
  "sinks": "getattr calls on django_settings, attribute access via __getattribute__",
  "flows": "Access to attributes in LazySettings -> fallback to django_settings if attribute missing",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected; no unusual code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code defines a LazySettings class that proxies attribute access to Django's settings module, providing default values for specific attributes. It avoids executing code beyond attribute access and does not include external or network activity. The __getattribute__ method correctly handles missing attributes without executing untrusted code or malicious actions. No signs of obfuscation, data leaks, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard lazy-loading proxy for Django settings with no malicious intent. It only manages attribute access with defaults and does not perform any harmful actions or malicious data handling.",
