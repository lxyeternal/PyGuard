  "purpose": "Proxy for Django settings with default attribute values, enabling lazy access and fallback defaults.",
  "sources": "Attribute access via __getattribute__ to django_settings; default class attributes HIJACK_PERMISSION_CHECK and HIJACK_INSERT_BEFORE.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external communication or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Attribute access from settings proxy to django_settings; fallback to class defaults if attribute missing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward proxy pattern, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a LazySettings class that proxies attribute access to django.conf.settings, with specific default values. It uses __getattribute__ to delegate attribute retrieval, which is a common pattern for lazy-loading or proxy objects. The class attributes are static strings related to permissions and HTML structure, not sensitive data. No network activity, code injection, or obfuscation is present. The pattern is standard and benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the code's nature. The code does not contain hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic, and the default attributes are non-sensitive constants.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard proxy pattern for Django settings access, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
