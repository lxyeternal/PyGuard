  "purpose": "Import statements for the 'atlassian_jwt_auth' library modules related to JWT authentication, signing, key retrieval, and verification.",
  "sources": "Import statements accessing various functions and classes from 'atlassian_jwt_auth' modules.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling observed; imports do not execute code or handle data directly.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow or source-to-sink pathways present; only static import declarations.",
  "anomalies": "All import statements are straightforward, importing public classes and functions. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing specific functions and classes from the 'atlassian_jwt_auth' library. There are no indications of dynamic code execution, data handling, or any suspicious behavior. The imports target modules related to JWT authentication, signing, key retrieval, and verification, which are typical in JWT-based security implementations. The use of 'noqa' comments indicates an attempt to suppress linter warnings, not malicious intent. Overall, the code appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a set of import statements from a JWT authentication library and shows no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. It appears to be part of a larger secure implementation. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident based on this code alone.",
