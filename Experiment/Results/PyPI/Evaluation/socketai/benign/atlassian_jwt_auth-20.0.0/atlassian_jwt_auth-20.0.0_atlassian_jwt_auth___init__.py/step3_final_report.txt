  "purpose": "Import statements for JWT authentication components from the 'atlassian_jwt_auth' library, likely part of setup or configuration.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from 'atlassian_jwt_auth' modules.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows; no runtime data processing or external input handling present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; only static imports with no active code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from a reputable JWT library, with no active logic, data handling, or network interactions. The use of '# noqa' comments is standard for suppressing linter warnings. The code's simplicity and clarity, along with the absence of any suspicious constructs, indicate benign intent. The import statements are typical for setting up JWT operations in a larger application. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of import statements for JWT authentication, with no malicious or suspicious activity. The scores are justified, and no further action is necessary.",
