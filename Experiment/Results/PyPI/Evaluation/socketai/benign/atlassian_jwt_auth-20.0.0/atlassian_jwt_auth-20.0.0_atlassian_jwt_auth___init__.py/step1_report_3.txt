{
  "purpose": "Import modules and functions related to JWT authentication from the atlassian_jwt_auth library.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the atlassian_jwt_auth package, which load functions and classes for JWT algorithms, signing, key retrieval, and verification.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the code only imports modules and functions, no data processing or output is shown.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable in the provided code snippet; it's only import statements.",
  "anomalies": "All imports are standard and from a well-known library; no hardcoded secrets, suspicious patterns, or unusual code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions and classes from the atlassian_jwt_auth library, which are used for handling JWT authentication processes such as algorithm permission checks, signing, key retrieval, and verification. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns. The code appears to be part of a larger system that manages JWT tokens with legitimate functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import of JWT-related modules from a reputable library, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It simply prepares to perform JWT operations, typical for authentication workflows.",
