{
  "purpose": "The code imports functions and classes from the atlassian_jwt_auth library to handle JWT authentication processes, including creating signers and verifying tokens.",
  "sources": "Import statements pulling functions and classes from the atlassian_jwt_auth package modules.",
  "sinks": "None directly; no functions are called that process untrusted data within this snippet.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no runtime data flow or processing occurs in this static import code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard import statements. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from a well-known JWT authentication library. It imports functions for creating signers, retrieving public keys, and verifying JWT tokens. There are no function calls, data processing, or untrusted data handling shown. No suspicious or malicious activity can be inferred from this snippet alone. The imports indicate intended use for JWT operations, but do not execute any actions or contain vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of import statements for a JWT authentication library. It does not contain malicious code or suspicious behavior. The code appears to be part of a larger application that handles JWT signing and verification, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues in this snippet.",
