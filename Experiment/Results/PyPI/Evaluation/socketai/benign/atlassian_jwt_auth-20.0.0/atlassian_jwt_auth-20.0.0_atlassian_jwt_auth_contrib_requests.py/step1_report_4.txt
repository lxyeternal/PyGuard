  "purpose": "Define a JWT authentication class for attaching JWT tokens to HTTP requests, and a factory function for creating such objects.",
  "sources": "import statements, __call__ method, create_jwt_auth function",
  "sinks": "The __call__ method modifies request headers by adding an Authorization header; create_jwt_auth calls the create method of JWTAuth",
  "flows": "The create_jwt_auth function creates a JWTAuth object, which when called (__call__), adds a token to request headers",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious behavior. The code delegates token creation to external methods, which are not shown here.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a JWT authentication class extending AuthBase and BaseJWTAuth, with a method to add a JWT token to request headers. The factory function creates an instance of JWTAuth with provided parameters. There are no evident malicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code flows. The security depends on the external implementation of create and _get_header_value methods, but in this code snippet, nothing suspicious is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of JWT authentication, delegating token generation to external methods. No malicious behavior or security risks are apparent within this snippet.",
