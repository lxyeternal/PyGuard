  "purpose": "Define a JWT authentication class and a factory function to create an instance for use with HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to create_jwt_auth: issuer, key_identifier, private_key_pem, audience",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; potential use of private_key_pem in create_jwt_auth",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to instantiate JWTAuth; the class method adds an Authorization header during requests",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code. No unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports JWT authentication components and defines a class that appends a JWT bearer token to HTTP request headers. The create_jwt_auth function creates an instance of JWTAuth with provided credentials. No hardcoded secrets, network connections, or malicious patterns are present. The code appears to implement standard JWT auth functionality for HTTP requests.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard JWT authentication setup for HTTP requests without any signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
