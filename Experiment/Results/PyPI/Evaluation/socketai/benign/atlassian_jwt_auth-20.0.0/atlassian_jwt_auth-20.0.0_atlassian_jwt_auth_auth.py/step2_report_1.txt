  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the evidence, logic, and scoring.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is straightforward, uses a well-known external library, and no malicious behavior or obfuscation is evident.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None identified.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 seem reasonable given the benign nature.\n- **Justification for risk score:** The low risk score aligns with the code's straightforward JWT creation functionality.\n- **Overall:** Accurate assessment; no changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is standard JWT creation, relying on external library.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are appropriate.\n- **Justification for risk score:** Slightly higher than report 1, but still low, reflecting standard JWT practices.\n- **Overall:** Correct.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Again, standard JWT creation.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 reasonable.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior, just standard token creation.\n- **Overall:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is typical JWT token generation.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 appropriate.\n- **Overall:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Standard JWT creation with external library.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 suitable.\n- **Overall:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are zero, which is consistent.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation (0.1 or 0.2). Given the code's benign nature, a uniform risk score of **0.1** to **0.2** is appropriate.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (low, standard JWT implementation)\n\n**Note:** Since all reports agree on the benign nature, I would assign a conservative risk score of **0.1** for the overall code, reflecting minimal security concern but acknowledging that JWT handling involves sensitive keys and external dependencies.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, standard implementation of JWT authentication using Atlassian's library. No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws is present. The scores provided in the reports are reasonable; I would maintain or slightly lower the risk score to 0.1 for a conservative estimate.",
