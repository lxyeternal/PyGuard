{
  "purpose": "Provides a JWT bearer token for authentication following the ASAP specification using Atlassian's JWT library.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters during initialization, including signer, audience, and additional claims; uses signer.generate_jwt() to create token.",
  "sinks": "Returns the JWT token string; no untrusted data sinks or external data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (signer, audience, claims) flow into generate_jwt() to produce the token; no external data flows or network activity within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward use of external library; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a direct implementation of JWT token creation using a trusted external library. It does not contain obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code. The private key handling is external, which is standard practice but requires secure management outside this snippet. The code's logic is simple and adheres to best practices for JWT generation, with no evident vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of JWT authentication relying on a reputable external library. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws are present. The overall security risk is minimal, primarily dependent on external key management. Malware score: 0, obfuscated score: 0, security risk score: 0.2.",
