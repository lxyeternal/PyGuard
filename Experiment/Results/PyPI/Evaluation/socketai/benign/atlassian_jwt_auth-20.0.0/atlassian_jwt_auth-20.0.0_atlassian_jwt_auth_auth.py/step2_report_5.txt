  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The code matches the description; it defines a class for JWT creation using Atlassian's library, with no suspicious modifications.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No logical errors or suspicious behavior are identified.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — consistent with the absence of malicious code.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — code is straightforward.  \n  - Risk: 0.1 — minimal, justified by the reliance on external library and proper handling.\n- **Justification:** The code is a standard JWT wrapper; no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, low-risk implementation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The code aligns with the description; it creates JWTs with user-provided keys and claims.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No evident flaws. The main concern is the handling of private keys, but that's outside this code scope.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — no malicious code.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — straightforward code.  \n  - Risk: 0.2 — justified because improper handling of private keys outside this code could be risky, but within this code, no issues are visible.\n- **Justification:** The code's security depends on external key management, but the code itself is standard.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; standard JWT creation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Matches the code; standard JWT creation with external signer.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No suspicious patterns or flaws.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — no malware detected.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — clear code.  \n  - Risk: 0.2 — acceptable given the external dependencies and key handling.\n- **Justification:** The code is typical for JWT auth; no malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, low risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Consistent with the code; standard JWT header creation.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues found.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — no malware.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — clear code.  \n  - Risk: 0.2 — justified.\n- **Justification:** Straightforward implementation; no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign JWT creation code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The code matches; it creates JWTs with external signer.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — no malware.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — clear code.  \n  - Risk: 0.2 — justified.\n- **Justification:** Standard JWT token creation, relying on external library.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, low risk.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports are 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** Mostly 0.2, justified by external dependencies and sensitive key handling outside this code, but no direct vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — acceptable for cryptographic code depending on external key management; no internal flaws.\n\n**Overall, the code appears to be a standard, legitimate implementation of JWT authentication, with no malicious intent or obfuscation.**",
