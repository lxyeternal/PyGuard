{
  "purpose": "Defines a class for creating and adding a JWT bearer token to HTTP requests according to the ASAP specification.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for 'create' method (issuer, key_identifier, private_key_pem, audience, additional_claims); signer generation via atlassian_jwt_auth.create_signer.",
  "sinks": "Generation of JWT token via signer.generate_jwt; returning the token as a byte string prefixed with 'Bearer '.",
  "flows": "create() method calls atlassian_jwt_auth.create_signer() to generate a signer, which then produces a JWT token in _get_header_value().",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious dynamic code execution. Use of external library appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for JWT token creation, leveraging a third-party library 'atlassian_jwt_auth'. The methods involve standard practices for JWT creation and header formatting. No obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious network activity is present. The signer is created via an external library function, which is typical for JWT handling. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage within this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to implement standard JWT authentication functionality using a third-party library with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a straightforward, secure implementation of token creation.",
