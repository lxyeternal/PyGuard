  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, assessing the reasoning, and ensuring consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The code appears straightforward; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The use of 'atlassian_jwt_auth' library is standard.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None identified. The reasoning is sound.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - malware: 0 — justified, no malicious activity.  \n  - obfuscated: 0 — code is clear.  \n  - securityRisk: 0.1 — very low, justified by the minimal risk of mishandling private keys outside this code.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The code generates JWT tokens using provided keys and parameters. The main concern is the handling of private keys and the external library.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No false claims. The reasoning correctly states that the security depends on external library and proper key management.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - malware: 0 — no malicious activity.  \n  - obfuscated: 0 — code is transparent.  \n  - securityRisk: 0.2 — justified, as improper key handling outside this code could be risky.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Similar to previous reports; standard JWT creation with external library.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No false assumptions. The analysis is consistent.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - malware: 0 — no malicious behavior.  \n  - obfuscated: 0 — code is clear.  \n  - securityRisk: 0.2 — justified, similar to others.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same pattern; standard JWT token creation, no suspicious activity.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No false claims. The reasoning is sound.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - malware: 0 — no malicious activity.  \n  - obfuscated: 0 — code is straightforward.  \n  - securityRisk: 0.2 — justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; standard JWT creation with external library.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No false claims.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - malware: 0 — no malicious activity.  \n  - obfuscated: 0 — clear code.  \n  - securityRisk: 0.2 — justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, consistent with the clear code.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1 or 0.2), justified by the fact that improper handling of private keys outside this code could pose security risks, but the code itself does not introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the reports' reasoning.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — acknowledging that external key management is critical; the code itself is benign but sensitive.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. The code is a standard, secure implementation of JWT authentication relying on external libraries, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
