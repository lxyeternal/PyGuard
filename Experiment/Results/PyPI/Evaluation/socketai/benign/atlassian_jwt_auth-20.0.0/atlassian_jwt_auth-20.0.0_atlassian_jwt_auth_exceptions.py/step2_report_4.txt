  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the scores assigned, and whether they align with the content.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines custom exception classes with wrapping and optional HTTP status code attributes. No malicious behavior, external input, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report's conclusion aligns with the code. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is correctly scored as zero. The high confidence score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard exception class definitions, inheritance, and attribute handling. No external data or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the analysis matches the code. No malicious intent or security issues are evident. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Exception classes with optional 'status_code' attribute, no external data, no malicious patterns. The only notable point is the use of args/kwargs, which is standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe securityRisk score is set to 0.1, which is slightly above zero. Given the code's nature—simple exception classes with no external data handling or network operations—this seems overly cautious. The risk score should likely remain at 0, as there's no evident security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, standard exception class definitions, no malicious behavior, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nScores are appropriate. The code is straightforward, with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Exception classes with exception wrapping and 'original_exception' attribute. No malicious activity, external data, or suspicious patterns. Slightly lower confidence (0.95) perhaps due to cautious wording.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.95.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe scores seem appropriate. The code is standard, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious behavior is present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly assign 0; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security Risk Score:**  \n  - Most reports assign 0, which is appropriate.  \n  - Report 3 assigns 0.1, which appears unjustified given the code's simplicity. I recommend lowering this to 0 for consistency and accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Adjust Report 3's securityRisk score from 0.1 to 0.**  \n- **Overall malware and obfuscated scores are correct at 0.**  \n- **Confidence levels are justified.**\n\n### My own estimate after review:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0 (since the code is purely structural exception handling without external or malicious elements)\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is benign, standard, and safe for use in an authentication library.",
