  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code, its logic, and the associated scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions.\n- No external input handling, network operations, or data processing.\n- Use of standard Python inheritance, exception wrapping, and optional attributes.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.\n- The code appears to be a well-structured, typical implementation for error handling in an authentication library.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Summary:** Defines custom exception classes with wrapping and HTTP status code support.\n- **Analysis:** No anomalies, no suspicious patterns, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code content. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with focus on error handling classes.\n- **Analysis:** Straightforward class definitions, no external data or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Summary:** Focus on exception classes with optional status codes, no external input.\n- **Analysis:** No anomalies, no suspicious constructs, standard practice.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Note:** The securityRisk score is 0.1, which is very low and acceptable given the code's benign nature.\n\n**Assessment:** The risk score seems appropriate; no malicious implications.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, defining exception classes with wrapping and status.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious code or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Fully consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Summary:** Same as above, focusing on exception class hierarchy.\n- **Analysis:** No anomalies, no malicious intent, straightforward.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.95.\n\n**Note:** Slightly lower confidence, but still very high. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports, correct.\n- **Security risk:** Ranges from 0 to 0.1, which is reasonable given the code's simplicity and lack of external data handling.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (or at most 0.1 if considering minimal risk due to exception handling, but this is negligible)\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate given the code's benign and standard nature. No changes are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Confirm that the malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores remain at 0 or very close to it.  \n- The code does not pose any security threat or malicious behavior.",
