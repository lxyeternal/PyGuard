  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step, focusing on potential security implications, correctness, and consistency.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Defines several custom exception classes for an authentication library.\n- Uses inheritance, including exception wrapping (`_WrappedException`) that preserves the original exception.\n- Adds optional attributes like `status_code`.\n- No external data handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  The reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward set of exception class definitions with no malicious behavior. No anomalies, no obfuscated code, no data leaks, and no external inputs or outputs are involved.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.  \n- The use of `getattr(orig, 'original_exception', orig)` in `_WrappedException` is standard for exception wrapping, ensuring original exception details are preserved.  \n- The inheritance structure and attribute handling are correct and follow Python conventions.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign `0`. No malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign `0`, which is appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** Mostly `0`, with one report giving `0.1`. This is reasonable given the code's benign nature.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- The only slight elevation (`0.1`) in one report seems to be a conservative placeholder, possibly considering that exception handling could be misused if exceptions are logged insecurely elsewhere. But within this code, there's no direct security risk.\n- The high confidence (`1` or `0.95`) is justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified here. The code does not process untrusted input or perform risky operations.\n- The use of exception wrapping is standard and does not introduce security issues.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n- No discrepancies between the code and the report conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk, exception classes are standard and safe)\n\n### My own estimate:\nGiven the analysis, I would assign:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is purely structural, for error handling, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No changes are necessary. The scores reflect the benign nature of the code, and the detailed reasoning confirms no hidden malicious or risky behavior exists.",
