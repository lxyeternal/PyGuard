{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for an authentication library, enabling exception wrapping and status handling.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes and constructors without external data input.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "None; the code solely declares class structures without data flow or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides class definitions for various exception types related to authentication and key retrieval. It includes mechanisms for wrapping exceptions and attaching optional status codes. The classes are standard Python practices for error handling, with inheritance used to maintain compatibility and functionality. There are no indications of malicious code, suspicious data handling, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious intent or security concerns. It is intended for structured error handling in a larger authentication system.",
