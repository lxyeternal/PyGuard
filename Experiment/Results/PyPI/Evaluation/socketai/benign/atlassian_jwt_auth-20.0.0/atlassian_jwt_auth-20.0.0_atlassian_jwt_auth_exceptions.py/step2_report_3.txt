  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n**1. Confirm if the reported issues are present in the code.**  \nThe code is a set of custom exception classes with inheritance, optional attributes, and exception wrapping. All reports accurately describe the code's structure and purpose. No discrepancies or missing issues are evident.\n\n**2. Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic, reasoning, or summary.**  \nThe reports uniformly state that the code is standard, straightforward, and free of malicious or suspicious patterns. They correctly identify that the code is purely for structured error handling, with no external data handling, network operations, or security risks. No logical flaws or inaccuracies are apparent.\n\n**3. Review the scores given to each issue and suggest changes if unreasonable.**  \nScores are all very high (confidence 1 or 0.95), with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, which aligns with the code's nature. The only point of note is report #3 assigns a `securityRisk` of 0.1, which is very low and reasonable given the benign nature of the code. Overall, the scores seem appropriate.\n\n**4. Justify any risk score higher than 0.5.**  \nNone of the reports assign a risk above 0.1, and the code itself shows no signs of security vulnerabilities or malicious intent. Therefore, no justification for higher risk scores is necessary.\n\n**5. Challenge claims based on assumptions.**  \nAll reports avoid unwarranted assumptions. They focus on the code's structure, purpose, and lack of malicious patterns, which is appropriate.\n\n**6. Ensure scores are consistent with the report.**  \nScores are consistent with the analysis. The malware and obfuscated scores are zero, aligning with the absence of malicious or obfuscated code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Code is clear, straightforward class definitions.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risks identified.\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for an authentication library. It uses common Python patterns, with no external data handling, network operations, or security-sensitive behavior. The exception wrapping and optional attributes are typical for such use cases.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is benign, well-structured, and poses no security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
