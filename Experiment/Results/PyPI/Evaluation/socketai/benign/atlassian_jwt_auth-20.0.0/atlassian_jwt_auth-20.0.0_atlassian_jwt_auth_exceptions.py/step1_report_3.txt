{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling related to authentication and key retrieval in a security library.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to exception constructors, such as args and kwargs, especially 'status_code'.",
  "sinks": "Exception instantiation and attribute assignment; no untrusted data is directly used in sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from constructor arguments into exception objects without external or untrusted sources influencing security-critical operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code is straightforward class inheritance for exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code implements custom exception classes with optional attributes, mainly for categorizing and handling specific error scenarios. It uses standard Python inheritance and attribute setting. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. The only notable aspect is the use of 'args' and 'kwargs' for flexible exception message handling, which is normal. The code does not interact with external systems, files, or environment variables, and contains no network or data transmission logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign set of custom exception classes for a security-related library. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. It serves a structural purpose without security risks.",
