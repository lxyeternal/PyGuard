  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions.\n- No external input handling, network operations, or data processing is present.\n- The code uses standard Python inheritance, exception wrapping, and optional attributes.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are observed.\n- The use of 'getattr' to retrieve 'original_exception' is a common pattern for exception wrapping.\n- The purpose is to facilitate structured error handling within an authentication library.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Summary:** Defines exception classes with wrapping and status code support.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Score justification:** Security risk is 0, malware is 0, confidence is 1.\n- **Verdict:** Fully aligned. No issues.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with exception classes for authentication errors.\n- **Analysis:** No external data or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** All zeros, confidence 1.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Summary:** Exception classes with optional 'status_code', no external data.\n- **Analysis:** No anomalies or malicious patterns.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — Slightly above zero, perhaps due to the potential for misuse of exception attributes, but overall benign.\n- **Scores:** All consistent.\n- **Verdict:** No security issues.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, standard exception classes.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious intent, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** All zeros, confidence 1.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Summary:** Exception classes with wrapping and 'getattr' for original exception.\n- **Analysis:** Standard pattern, no signs of malicious code.\n- **Confidence:** Slightly less than 1 (0.95), possibly due to the use of 'getattr' which could be misused, but in this context, it's standard.\n- **Scores:** All zeros, security risk 0.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assigned 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly assigned 0.\n- **Risk score:** Most are 0, with one at 0.1 (Report 3). Given the benign nature, 0.1 might be slightly high but acceptable as a conservative estimate.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0 across all, as there's no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk:** 0 for all, perhaps 0.05 at most for the one with a slightly higher score, but 0.1 is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is straightforward, standard exception class definitions with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores are reasonable, and no changes are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the scores as they are, with perhaps a slight reduction of the risk score in report 3 to 0, but overall, the current scores are justified.",
