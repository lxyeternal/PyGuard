{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various authentication and key retrieval errors in a security/authentication library.",
  "sources": "Initialization methods (__init__) of exception classes, attribute access (getattr) for 'original_exception'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the exception classes could be used to log or report errors, but there are no direct sinks or external data outputs within this code.",
  "flows": "Exception instantiation and attribute setting during error handling, particularly in _WrappedException.__init__ and _WithStatus.__init__.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets, malicious behavior, or data leaks are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exceptions for an authentication library, with mechanisms to wrap exceptions and include HTTP status codes. The use of 'getattr' to preserve original exceptions is standard practice. There are no signs of malicious code, external data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior. The classes serve typical error handling purposes, and the code structure appears straightforward and compliant with common patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for authentication errors. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. The implementation appears safe and intended for error management in an authentication context.",
