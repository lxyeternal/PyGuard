{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in an authentication library, with support for wrapping exceptions and adding HTTP status codes.",
  "sources": "Exception instantiations and attribute assignments within class constructors.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no untrusted data handling, network operations, or sensitive information processing present.",
  "flows": "Exception creation flows within class initializers, mainly object attribute setting.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, and no dynamic execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of custom exception class definitions with inheritance and optional attributes. The _WrappedException class preserves the original exception details, and _WithStatus adds an HTTP status code attribute. The exception classes are straightforward, used for error signaling within an authentication context. No external input handling, network operations, or data leaks are evident. No malicious or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a set of structured exception classes for an authentication library. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious patterns, and does not pose security risks. It is well-structured and standard for such use cases.",
