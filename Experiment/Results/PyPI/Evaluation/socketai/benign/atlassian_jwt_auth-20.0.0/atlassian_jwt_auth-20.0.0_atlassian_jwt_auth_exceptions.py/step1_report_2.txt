  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes with optional attributes for handling authentication and key retrieval errors.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing is present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code is solely class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions primarily for exception handling, with inheritance and attribute management. It uses standard Python features and inheritance without any dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior. There are no external data sources, user inputs, or potential injection points. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes for use in a larger authentication system.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard, well-structured exception class definitions without any signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
