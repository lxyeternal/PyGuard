  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for structured error handling in an authentication library, with support for exception wrapping and optional HTTP status codes.",
  "sources": "Class initializers (__init__), getattr for 'original_exception', and class inheritance.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data input, network operations, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Exception instantiation and wrapping via __init__, with optional attribute assignment (status_code).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard exception class definitions, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, utilizing standard Python inheritance and exception wrapping patterns. The use of 'getattr' to retrieve 'original_exception' is typical for exception chaining. No external input handling, network activity, or data processing occurs. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and aligns with common practices for error handling. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk mostly 0 with one at 0.1) are appropriate and conservative. The slight elevation in one report's security risk score (0.1) is unnecessary given the benign nature of the code, and should be adjusted to 0 for consistency.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exception classes for an authentication library. It poses no security threat or malicious intent. The reports accurately assess the code, and the scores are justified. No modifications are needed.",
