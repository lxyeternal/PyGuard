  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a straightforward function returning a static list of cryptographic algorithm names.\n   - No external inputs, dynamic behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - The code appears benign and intended as a whitelist.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as a static list with no security issues.\n   - No logical errors or flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`, which are appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, reflecting certainty about the benign assessment.\n   - These scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports indicate no malicious activity, no obfuscation, and no security risk, raising the risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified.\n   - The function's purpose is purely to return a static list, which is safe.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign `malware: 0`.\n   - The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior, such as executing untrusted code, exfiltration, or hidden payloads.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as a benign whitelist.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the analysis.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a simple, static whitelist of cryptographic algorithms.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that. No changes are necessary.",
