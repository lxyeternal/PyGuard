{
  "purpose": "Provide a list of permitted algorithm names for cryptographic operations or validations.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded list within the return statement.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of this list in cryptographic validation functions or security checks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the function return to calling code that uses this list for validation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is straightforward and contains a static list.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple function returning a static list of cryptographic algorithm names. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are involved. The list appears to be a whitelist of accepted algorithms, which is typical in security contexts. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns are present. The function's purpose is clear and safe, with no signs of malicious behavior or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static list of permitted algorithms, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
