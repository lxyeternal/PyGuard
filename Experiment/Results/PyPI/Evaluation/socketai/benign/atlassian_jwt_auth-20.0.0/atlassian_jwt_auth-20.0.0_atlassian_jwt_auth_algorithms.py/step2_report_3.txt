  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the original code.\n\n1. **Code Verification:**\n   - The original code is a straightforward function returning a static list of cryptographic algorithm names.\n   - No user input, environment variables, external data sources, or dynamic code execution are involved.\n   - The list contains standard algorithms, serving as a whitelist for cryptographic validation.\n   - There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Report Consistency and Validity:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign, static, and intended for configuration or validation purposes.\n   - They correctly identify the function's purpose and the absence of external dependencies or dynamic behavior.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are detected in any report.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n   - **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Assumptions:**\n   - Since the code is static and contains only whitelisted algorithms, there's no basis for higher risk scores.\n   - No suspicious patterns or behaviors are present.\n   - The reports' assessments seem reasonable and well-justified.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is safe, with no malicious intent or security risks.\n   - The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate.\n   - No modifications are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\nBased on the detailed review, I concur with the reports' assessments. The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should all remain at **0**. The code is a benign, static whitelist function with no evidence of malicious behavior or security concerns.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current evaluations and the code's nature.",
