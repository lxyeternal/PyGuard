{
  "purpose": "Returns a list of permitted cryptographic algorithm names.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; the function uses a static list defined within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involved; the function only returns a predefined list without processing untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the function simply provides a static list.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and contains no hidden or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The function defines and returns a hardcoded list of cryptographic algorithm identifiers, which is typical for configuration or validation purposes. There is no input handling, no external dependencies, no dynamic code execution, and no evidence of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The code appears to serve as a static reference for permitted algorithms, with no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving to provide a fixed list of allowed cryptographic algorithms. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe for use as intended.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
