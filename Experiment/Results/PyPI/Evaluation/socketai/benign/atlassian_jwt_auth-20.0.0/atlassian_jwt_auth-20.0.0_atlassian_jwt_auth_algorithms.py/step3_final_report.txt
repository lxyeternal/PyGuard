{
  "purpose": "Return a static list of permitted cryptographic algorithm names for validation or whitelisting purposes.",
  "sources": "The function does not read external input; it simply returns a hardcoded list.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data flows; the function outputs a static list.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from sources to sinks as there are no external inputs or outputs beyond the return statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple function returning a predefined list of cryptographic algorithms. It involves no external inputs, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify it as benign, static, and intended for whitelisting. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The code's purpose is clear, and it does not pose any security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static whitelist function with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The reports' assessments are accurate, and the assigned scores are justified. No modifications or concerns are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
