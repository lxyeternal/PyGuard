{
  "purpose": "Provides a list of permitted cryptographic algorithm names for use in security or cryptography functions.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; the function returns a hardcoded list.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involved; no untrusted data processing or external data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; static return of a predefined list.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that returns a hardcoded list of algorithm names used in cryptography, likely for validation purposes. There are no external inputs, no data processing, and no dynamic behavior. The list contains standard cryptographic algorithms, and the code appears to be for whitelist validation or configuration. No suspicious or malicious behaviors, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation, are evident. The simplicity and clarity reduce the likelihood of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple static function returning a list of approved cryptographic algorithms. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears to serve a legitimate purpose in validating algorithm choices.",
