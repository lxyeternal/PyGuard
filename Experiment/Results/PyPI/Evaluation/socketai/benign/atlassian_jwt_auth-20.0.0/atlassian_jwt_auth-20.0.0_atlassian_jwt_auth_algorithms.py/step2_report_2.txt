  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n1. **Code Confirmation:**\n- The original code is a straightforward function returning a static list of cryptographic algorithm names. It does not involve any external inputs, dynamic code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- The reports accurately describe the code as a static list used for whitelisting algorithms, with no anomalies or malicious behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their descriptions. They correctly identify that the code is benign, static, and intended for configuration or validation.\n- No errors or logical flaws are evident in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n  - `obfuscated`: 0 (not obfuscated)\n  - `malware`: 0 (no malware)\n  - `securityRisk`: 0 (no security risk)\n- These scores are reasonable given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n- No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Justification:**\n- Since the code is a static list of permitted algorithms, the risk is minimal.\n- Malware score is 0, which is appropriate; there is no malicious activity.\n- The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as a benign whitelist.\n- No overreach or speculative claims are present.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n- The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — The code's purpose is to provide a static list for validation, with no security risks.\n\n### Overall Justification:\nGiven the static, benign nature of the code, the scores are appropriate. The code serves as a whitelist of cryptographic algorithms, which is a common and safe pattern.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nNo concerns are raised by the reports or the code itself.",
