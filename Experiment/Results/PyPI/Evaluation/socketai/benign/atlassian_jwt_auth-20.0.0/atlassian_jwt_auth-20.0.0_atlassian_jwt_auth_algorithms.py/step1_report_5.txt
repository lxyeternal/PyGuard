{
  "purpose": "Return a list of permitted cryptographic algorithm names.",
  "sources": "No external input sources are present; the function uses hardcoded data.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external interactions are present; the function only returns a static list.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static data is returned directly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The function simply returns a predefined list of algorithm names used in cryptographic operations. There are no external inputs, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious patterns. The code is straightforward and appears to serve as a whitelist for algorithm validation. No security risks, malware, or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, safe utility function that provides a static list of permitted algorithms. There are no security concerns or malicious behavior detected.",
