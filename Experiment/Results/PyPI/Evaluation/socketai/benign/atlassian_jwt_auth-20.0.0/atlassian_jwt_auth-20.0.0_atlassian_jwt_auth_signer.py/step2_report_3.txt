  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the provided code to ensure consistency, correctness, and appropriateness of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides JWT signing with key management and caching, no malicious behavior, and follows best practices.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code does not contain any signs of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation.  \n- The security risk score of 0.2 seems reasonable given that private keys are handled externally and securely, but any mishandling could pose risks.  \n- The high confidence (0.9) aligns with the thorough reasoning.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard JWT handling, proper use of cryptography, and no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The reasoning aligns with the code.  \n- No signs of malware or obfuscation.  \n- The use of SystemRandom for 'jti' is standard, not suspicious.  \n- The security risk remains low.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, emphasizing secure key handling, token reuse, and standard practices.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Consistent with previous assessments.  \n- No malicious indicators.  \n- The scores seem justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on standard JWT signing, key caching, token reuse, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The analysis aligns with the code's functionality.  \n- No signs of malware or obfuscation.  \n- The security risk score is consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, noting JWT creation, caching, and the use of SystemRandom for 'jti'.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The use of SystemRandom for 'jti' is standard for cryptographically secure random IDs.  \n- No malicious behavior or obfuscation.  \n- The security risk score remains low.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate given the code's clarity.\n- **Security Risk Score:** 0.2 across all reports seems reasonable, considering external key management and the absence of evident vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** High (0.9), justified by thorough reasoning.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.2\n\nThe code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured implementation of JWT token signing with secure practices, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent and justified.",
