{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple utility for performing a specific task, possibly involving network communication or data processing, but the exact purpose is unclear without more context.",
  "sources": "Input is likely read from function parameters, environment variables, or external files, though no explicit input sources are visible in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network sockets, file write operations, or system commands, but no explicit sink points are evident from the current code fragment.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions, possibly towards network or storage sinks; however, specific source-to-sink paths are not clearly identifiable from the snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code patterns, or unusual behaviors are evident. The code does not contain obfuscated language features or malicious constructs within this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code lacks explicit input handling, output, or network communication, indicating a benign utility function. No signs of data leakage, malicious code injection, or suspicious activity are present. The code structure is straightforward, with no indicators of obfuscation or hidden functionality.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The code appears safe and intended for legitimate purposes.",
