  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Input from environment variables, standard input, external files or network sources.",
  "sinks": "System commands, network connections, file writes, environment variables.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks through data processing functions, possibly involving environment or network data.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation in code (notably in report 5), no hardcoded credentials, no suspicious patterns identified.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate low likelihood of malicious activity. Reports 1-4 describe benign, straightforward code with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious indicators, with confidence levels ranging from 0.7 to 0.9. Report 5 notes obfuscation (score 0.7) but no active malicious behavior, with a moderate confidence of 0.6. The malware scores are mostly 0, with report 5 at 0.1, justified by obfuscation but no confirmed malicious activity. Security risk scores are low (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal threat. Slight adjustments are suggested for report 4 (setting malware and obfuscation scores to 0 due to lack of code) and possibly increasing report 5's malware score marginally to 0.2 to account for obfuscation concerns. Overall, the assessments are consistent and cautious, appropriately reflecting the evidence.",
  "conclusion": "The code dependencies are predominantly benign with no active malicious behavior detected. Obfuscation in some cases warrants cautious monitoring but does not currently indicate malicious intent. Scores are justified and aligned with the analysis.",
