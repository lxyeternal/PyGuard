  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be a Python package component, possibly for data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules and potentially from environment variables or input functions, if present.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could potentially reach output functions, network communication, or file operations, if such are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (e.g., environment variables, function arguments) through internal processing functions, possibly reaching output or network transmission points.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. No suspicious dynamic code execution, unusual variable names, or unexpected behaviors observed. No signs of malicious privacy violations or data exfiltration in the provided fragment.",
  "analysis": "The code has been reviewed thoroughly. It imports standard and third-party libraries but does not display any risky patterns such as dynamic execution, network connections, or credential storage. No anomalies in structure or format. The code's purpose appears benign based on the provided snippet. Due to lack of suspicious patterns or malicious indicators, the overall security posture is considered safe.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a standard, benign Python module without harmful intent.",
