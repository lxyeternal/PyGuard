{
  "purpose": "The code provides mechanisms for retrieving, validating, and handling public and private cryptographic keys, primarily from HTTPS sources, data URIs, or local files, for use in JWT validation and cryptographic operations.",
  "sources": "User-controlled inputs include the key identifier strings, JWT tokens, data URIs, and file paths; environment variables are accessed for proxies in requests.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to retrieve public keys, file reads for private keys, and cryptographic operations for key loading.",
  "flows": "Input data (key identifiers, JWTs, data URIs, file paths) are validated and processed; key retrieval involves network or file I/O; retrieved keys are returned for cryptographic use.",
  "anomalies": "Use of standard validation for key identifiers, no suspicious hardcoded credentials; no obfuscated code; no dynamic code execution observed; error handling is standard. No signs of malicious privacy violations or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code carefully validates key identifiers to prevent directory traversal or injection attacks. Key retrieval from HTTPS sources uses caching and proxy handling without suspicious behavior. Private keys are loaded from data URIs, static data, or files, all with proper handling. No malicious or hidden code segments are present. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity are detected. The code appears to implement standard cryptographic key management procedures with appropriate error handling and security practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate key management functions with robust validation and retrieval methods. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. It appears safe and well-structured for its intended purpose.",
