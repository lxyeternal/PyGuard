{
  "purpose": "This code manages cryptographic keys by retrieving, validating, and loading them from various sources such as URLs, data URIs, and local files, ensuring secure handling and validation.",
  "sources": "URL fetches via HTTPS, data URIs, local file system reads, environment variables for proxies",
  "sinks": "Network requests for key retrieval, file reads for private keys, decoding and loading cryptographic keys",
  "flows": "Source inputs (URLs, data URIs, files) → validation and decoding → cryptography library loading → key usage",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, proper validation to prevent directory traversal and injection",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard, well-structured cryptographic key management functions. It validates key identifiers to prevent directory traversal, uses secure libraries for cryptography, handles network errors gracefully, and validates content types. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score of 0.2 reflects low external dependency risk with proper validation. Overall, the code appears legitimate, secure, and correctly implemented.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, standard implementation for cryptographic key retrieval and management with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
