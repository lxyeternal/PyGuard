  "purpose": "This code provides mechanisms for retrieving and validating cryptographic keys from various sources (HTTPS, data URI, local files) for use in JWT authentication and key management.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include JWT tokens (via jwt.get_unverified_header), key identifiers, URLs for public keys, data URIs, and local filesystem directories for private keys.",
  "sinks": "Sensitive operations occur when loading private keys, retrieving public keys, and parsing JWT headers. Potential leaks could happen if untrusted data is used insecurely in key retrieval or if errors reveal sensitive info.",
  "flows": "JWT header's 'kid' is validated and used as a key identifier; key identifiers are used to construct URLs for retrieving public keys; private keys are loaded from data URIs or local files based on inputs; exceptions propagate errors during network or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials detected. Use of base64 decoding and dynamic URL construction is standard but warrants caution if inputs are untrusted. The code does not perform any unusual or suspicious operations beyond normal key management. No backdoors or hidden behaviors apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly handles key validation, retrieval, and parsing for cryptographic operations. The validation functions prevent directory traversal or invalid key IDs. The key retrieval classes use standard libraries (requests, cryptography) and handle errors appropriately. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious actions are evident. Logging is limited to warnings on retrieval failures. The overall structure aligns with typical secure key management practices. No suspicious behavior or malware detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate key management implementation with proper validation and error handling. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware are present. It employs standard security practices for handling cryptographic keys and network requests. The overall security risk is low.",
