{
  "purpose": "This code provides a JWT verification utility that loads public keys, validates claims, and enforces JTI uniqueness, supporting multiple algorithms and issuer/subject validation.",
  "sources": "Reads JWT tokens, retrieves public keys via a retriever, accesses JWT headers and claims.",
  "sinks": "Uses jwt.decode to verify token signature and claims, accesses key identifiers, and maintains a cache for JTI to prevent replay.",
  "flows": "JWT token input → header parsing for 'alg' and 'kid' → public key retrieval → key loading → jwt.decode for validation → claim checks and JTI cache update.",
  "anomalies": "Use of internal '_algorithms' attribute from 'PyJWS' library, reliance on external key retriever which could involve network requests, no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard JWT validation with claim checks, issuer/sub validation, and JTI replay prevention. It relies on external key retrieval, which introduces dependency risk but not malicious activity. The use of private library attributes is a fragility concern but not malicious. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The code is well-structured and follows best practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented JWT verification utility with no evidence of malicious behavior. The primary concern is external key source trustworthiness, which is outside this code's scope. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, reflecting low but acknowledged dependency risk.",
