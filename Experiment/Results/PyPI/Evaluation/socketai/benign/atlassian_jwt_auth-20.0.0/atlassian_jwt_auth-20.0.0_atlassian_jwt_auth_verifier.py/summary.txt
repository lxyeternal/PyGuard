  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented JWT verification utility with no evidence of malicious behavior. The primary concern is external key source trustworthiness, which is outside this code's scope. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, reflecting low but acknowledged dependency risk."
