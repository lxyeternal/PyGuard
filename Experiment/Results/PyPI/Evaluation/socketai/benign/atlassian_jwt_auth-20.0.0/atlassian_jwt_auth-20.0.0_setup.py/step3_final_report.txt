  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input, environment variables, or data sources; it is a static configuration.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code executes a static setup call.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup()' with fixed parameters, serving as a minimal, static configuration script for packaging. It contains no dynamic code, user input, network activity, or external data interactions. All reports correctly identify its benign, standard nature. The scores assigned—malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0—are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious or risky behavior. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present, and the code poses no security threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. All assessments and scores are appropriate and align with the code's straightforward nature.",
