  "purpose": "Configure package setup using setuptools and pbr for distribution.",
  "sources": "Importing 'setup' from setuptools; reading setup configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is purely configuration with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard setup script with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' from setuptools and calls it with specific parameters. It specifies 'setup_requires' with a dependency constraint and enables pbr. The code is straightforward and typical for Python package setup scripts. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious code constructs. The script performs only configuration for package building.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not include any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
