  "purpose": "Implementation of scene detection algorithms for video analysis, including histogram, edge, and intensity-based methods.",
  "sources": "Read operations occur on 'videodata' input, which is processed via functions like rgb2gray, canny, and numpy array indexing. Data is accessed in loops over frames, e.g., 'videodata[t]'.",
  "sinks": "Data is processed internally; no direct untrusted data output or network transmission present. No file writes, external calls, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input data ('videodata') is transformed via color space conversions and feature extraction. For edge detection, data flows through canny and globalEdgeMotion functions. Histogram differences are computed from grayscale frames. Intensity differences are calculated from raw pixel values. No untrusted source to sink flows that cause external actions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. External dependencies such as numpy, scipy, and internal modules appear standard for image processing. No dynamic code execution, malicious network calls, or system modifications observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard video scene detection techniques: edge change analysis, histogram differences, and intensity change detection. All operations involve typical image processing steps like grayscale conversion, canny edge detection, morphological dilation, histogram computation, and frame differencing. The functions are modular and straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent. No data leakage, command execution, or network activity is evident. External libraries used are common scientific tools for image analysis. No anomalous behavior, suspicious code constructs, or potential backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements benign scene detection algorithms using conventional image processing techniques. There is no indication of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears to be a standard, non-malicious implementation for its intended purpose.",
