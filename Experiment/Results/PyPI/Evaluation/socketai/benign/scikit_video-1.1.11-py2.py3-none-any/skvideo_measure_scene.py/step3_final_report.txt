  "purpose": "Implementations of scene detection algorithms using image processing techniques such as histogram difference, edge change detection, and intensity variation.",
  "sources": "Input video data frames, specifically reading frame sequences for analysis.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; internal processing only, with no data exfiltration or external communication.",
  "flows": "Video frames are processed to compute differences or edge changes; no untrusted data flows outside the scope of image analysis functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected. External functions are assumed standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard scene detection techniques on video frames, utilizing common image processing functions. It does not invoke external system commands, network activity, or write to files. The logic is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The external dependencies (`rgb2gray`, `canny`, `globalEdgeMotion`) are typical in image processing and are assumed benign. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of scene detection algorithms with no signs of malware or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
