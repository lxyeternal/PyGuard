  "purpose": "Implement global motion estimators using edge features and distance measures.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'frame1' and 'frame2', functions 'canny' and 'np.roll', internal computations involving edge maps and distance calculations.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly observed; no data is written to external systems or network connections.",
  "flows": "Input frames are processed to generate edge maps, which are then shifted within a range, and distances are computed to determine the optimal displacement vector.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'np.bool', which is deprecated in recent NumPy versions; potential outdated syntax. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are observed. External dependencies like 'scipy' and 'np' are standard for image processing. The code performs computations without evident malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to compute Hausdorff distance and to estimate global motion between two frames using edge detection. It performs edge detection with 'canny' (assumed to be an imported utility), shifts images within a search radius, computes distances based on either Hamming or Hausdorff metrics, and returns the displacement vector that minimizes the distance. No network, system, or malicious activity is present. The use of deprecated 'np.bool' is noted but not malicious. The code appears to be a standard implementation for motion estimation in image processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of motion estimation techniques with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It relies on standard scientific libraries and performs typical image analysis operations. Minor obsolescence in 'np.bool' usage but no security concern. Overall, the code appears benign.",
