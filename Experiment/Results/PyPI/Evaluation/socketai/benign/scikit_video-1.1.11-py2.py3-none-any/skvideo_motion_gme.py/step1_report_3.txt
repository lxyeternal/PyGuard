  "purpose": "Implementation of global motion estimators using edge features, including functions to compute Hausdorff distance and estimate motion vectors between frames.",
  "sources": "Reads input frames (frame1, frame2), potentially edge maps if frames are boolean, and internally uses functions like canny (imported from utils) for edge detection.",
  "sinks": "Computations involving distance measures (hamming, Hausdorff) on edge maps; no direct sink for untrusted data to sensitive systems is evident.",
  "flows": "Input frames -> Edge detection (canny) -> Distance calculations across shifts -> Selection of minimal distance displacement.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. Uses standard image processing techniques and distance metrics. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code. The only minor concern could be reliance on imported functions from utils which are not visible here, but no suspicious behavior is indicated.",
  "analysis": "The code performs motion estimation by comparing edge maps of frames using either Hamming or Hausdorff distances. It correctly handles different input shapes and data types, applying canny edge detection when necessary. The implementation uses standard libraries (numpy, scipy) for image processing and distance calculations. No suspicious data leakage, network activity, or malicious actions are present. The functions are well-structured for their purpose, and no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscation are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of motion estimation algorithms for visual analysis, with no malicious intent or security risks evident. It uses standard image processing methods and distance metrics without any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
