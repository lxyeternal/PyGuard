{
  "purpose": "The code implements global motion estimators based on edge features, specifically calculating motion vectors between two frames using edge detection and distance metrics.",
  "sources": "Reads input frames (frame1, frame2), potentially from external data sources or files, and uses internal functions for image processing (canny, vshape).",
  "sinks": "Computes distances for matching edges and returns a motion vector; no sinks appear to leak data or perform destructive actions.",
  "flows": "Input frames -> Edge detection or binary maps -> Distance calculations (Hamming or Hausdorff) -> Find minimum distance -> Return motion vector.",
  "anomalies": "Uses np.bool which is deprecated; potential for misinterpretation of data type. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. No obfuscated code features present. External function calls (canny, vshape) are assumed standard. No network, file, or system manipulation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard image processing tasks: converting frames, edge detection, and calculating distances over a search window. The functions used (np.roll, scipy.ndimage, scipy.spatial) are typical for image analysis. The distance metrics used (Hamming and Hausdorff) are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code does not interact with network, filesystem beyond normal imports, or execute malicious commands. It appears to be a benign implementation for motion estimation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of edge-based global motion estimation, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It uses common image processing libraries and straightforward algorithms. No suspicious or malicious activities detected.",
