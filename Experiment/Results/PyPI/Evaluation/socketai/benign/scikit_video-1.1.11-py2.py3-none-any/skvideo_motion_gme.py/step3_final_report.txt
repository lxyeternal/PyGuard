  "purpose": "Implementing global motion estimation between two frames based on edge features, using distance metrics like Hamming or Hausdorff to find the translation vector that best aligns the edge maps.",
  "sources": "Edge maps generated from input frames via canny edge detection or directly provided as boolean arrays; the code reads frames and computes edge features.",
  "sinks": "In-memory computations; no external data sinks, network activity, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Edge maps are shifted via np.roll (source) across a range of displacements; distances are computed between shifted edge maps and original edge maps (sink), with the minimal distance determining the motion vector.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated np.bool; no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious data flows detected; no obfuscation or external command execution.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard image processing for motion estimation, utilizing edge detection and brute-force search over a defined radius. It relies on common libraries and functions, with no signs of malicious activity. The only minor issue is the deprecated np.bool, which does not impact security. The scoring of malware as 0, obfuscation as 0, and low security risk (~0.1-0.2) is consistent with the benign, straightforward implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign implementation of edge-based global motion estimation. No malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The minor syntax deprecation should be addressed but does not affect security. Overall, the code is safe for supply chain use.",
