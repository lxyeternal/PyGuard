  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code and applying critical reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code implements standard image processing techniques for motion estimation based on edge features.\n- It uses common libraries: numpy, scipy, and an external 'canny' function from utils.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior such as network access, data exfiltration, or code obfuscation.\n- The only technical concern is the use of `np.bool`, which is deprecated in recent NumPy versions, but this is not malicious—just outdated syntax.\n- The functions perform legitimate image processing tasks, with no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n\n- **Functionality:** The code's purpose aligns with its implementation: estimating global motion between frames via edge features.\n- **Input handling:** Proper shape assertions and edge detection steps are present.\n- **Security implications:** No signs of security risks, malware, or obfuscation.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n\n- **Use of `np.bool`:** All reports correctly identify that `np.bool` is deprecated. This is a minor issue but not security-related.\n- **Potential performance concerns:** The brute-force search within radius `r` is computationally intensive but not insecure.\n- **No code injection or external command execution:** Confirmed across reports.\n\n### Malware and obfuscation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n\n### Security risk:\n\n- The reports assign a very low security risk (~0.1-0.2), which is justified given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- **Use of deprecated `np.bool`:** Minor, but worth noting. Not malicious, just needs updating.\n- **External dependencies:** 'canny' from utils is assumed standard; no issues detected.\n- **Edge detection:** Uses standard techniques, no malicious intent.\n- **Distance calculations:** Use of Hamming and Hausdorff distances is standard for such tasks.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.  \n**Risk score:** **0.1-0.2** — minimal, mainly due to deprecated syntax, not security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to deprecated syntax but no security threat)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a legitimate, standard implementation of edge-based global motion estimation. No malicious, obfuscated, or high-risk behaviors are evident. The only technical note is updating deprecated NumPy syntax.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n- Slightly update `np.bool` to `bool` for compatibility.\n- No further security concerns. The code appears safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
