{
  "purpose": "Implement global motion estimators using edge features, specifically for comparing two frames and determining the motion vector between them.",
  "sources": "Input frames 'frame1' and 'frame2'; edge detection via 'canny' function; edge maps created or provided as boolean arrays.",
  "sinks": "No clear untrusted data sinks such as network transmission, file writing, or system commands; computations are performed on image data.",
  "flows": "Input frames -> edge detection -> shifted edge maps -> distance calculations -> selection of minimal distance displacement",
  "anomalies": "Use of potentially deprecated 'np.bool' (which is deprecated in favor of 'bool') for dtype check; no other anomalies observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs edge-based global motion estimation by computing differences between shifted edge maps of two frames, using either Hamming or Hausdorff distances. The function validates input shapes, performs edge detection if necessary, and searches within a radius 'r' for the best matching displacement vector. No evidence of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors is present. The code is straightforward and typical for motion estimation algorithms, with no suspicious code patterns or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of edge-based motion estimation with no indications of malicious intent. It processes input images to find motion vectors and does not perform any harmful or unauthorized actions.",
