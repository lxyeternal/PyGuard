{
  "purpose": "This code implements global motion estimators based on edge features, specifically for aligning two image frames using either Hamming or Hausdorff distance measures.",
  "sources": "The code reads input frames (frame1 and frame2) as ndarray objects, which are expected to be image data, and internally uses functions like canny for edge detection and numpy/scipy functions for image processing.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write to files, network, or execute external commands. It performs in-memory computations only.",
  "flows": "Input frames are processed to generate edge maps, which are then compared within a search radius to find the best displacement vector. The process involves rolling (shifting) edge images and calculating distances, with no untrusted data flowing into external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious data handling, or unusual code patterns are detected. Usage of standard libraries and straightforward processing indicates normal functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code processes input image frames, converting them to edge maps if not already binary. It performs a brute-force search within a radius for the best match based on specified distance metrics. The functions are well-structured, using assertions and clear parameter checks. No code injection, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors like network access or file manipulation are present. The canny edge detection is called from an external function, but this is standard. No hardcoded secrets or malicious backdoors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of global motion estimation based on edge features. It uses common image processing techniques with no signs of malicious intent, malicious data handling, or malicious side effects.",
