{
  "purpose": "Detects and manages paths and versions of media tools (ffmpeg, ffprobe, avconv, avprobe, mediainfo), primarily for environment setup and validation.",
  "sources": "System commands executed via check_output to retrieve version info and verify executable presence; filesystem checks for executable files.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or data leaks; no network activity or external data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "System commands (e.g., ffprobe -version) run to obtain version info; path validation functions check for executable existence.",
  "anomalies": "No malicious or suspicious code; commented-out sections are inactive and do not pose risks; code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment detection for media tools by executing system commands and verifying file existence. It does not process user input or network data, nor does it contain obfuscated or malicious code. The functions are simple and transparent, aimed at configuration and version retrieval. No signs of backdoors, data leaks, or malicious payloads are present. The commented sections are inactive and do not affect security. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate given the benign, utility nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for media environment detection. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The assigned scores are justified and accurate.",
