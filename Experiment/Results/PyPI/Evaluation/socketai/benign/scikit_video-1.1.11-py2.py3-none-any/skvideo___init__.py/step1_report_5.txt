{
  "purpose": "This module detects and manages system paths and versions for media processing tools (ffmpeg, ffprobe, avconv, avprobe, mediainfo) to facilitate media-related operations.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, system file paths, and program outputs from check_output calls (e.g., checking version info).",
  "sinks": "Potentially exposes version info and file paths via functions; uses check_output to run system commands with external programs.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (system paths, command outputs) are processed to determine tool presence and versions, stored in global variables, and accessed via functions.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to be solely for environment setup and version detection; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. No obfuscated code or misleading variable names are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs system environment detection by locating media processing tools, extracting version info, and managing their paths. It uses subprocess calls to system programs to determine their existence and versions, updating internal state accordingly. The functions are straightforward, with no evidence of data exfiltration, malicious payloads, or hidden backdoors. The code structure is consistent with a utility module for media tool management. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as an environment detection and configuration utility for media processing tools. It does not contain malware or malicious intent. It operates transparently, gathering version info and paths for legitimate use cases.",
