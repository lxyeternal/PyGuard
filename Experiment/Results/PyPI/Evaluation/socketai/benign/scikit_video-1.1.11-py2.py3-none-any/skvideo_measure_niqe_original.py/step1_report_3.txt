{
  "purpose": "The code computes image quality metrics using BRISQUE and NIQE algorithms, including patch-based feature extraction, statistical analysis, and comparison of images against precomputed models.",
  "sources": "Reads image files from specified directories, loads precomputed statistical models ('niqe_mu_*.pkl', 'niqe_cov_*.pkl'), loads MATLAB .mat files with image data and MOS scores, and reads images using skimage.io.imread.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data for malicious purposes; the code performs data analysis and model saving but does not transmit or store untrusted data elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Images are loaded from disk (source), features are extracted and processed, models are loaded or saved, and NIQE scores are computed for evaluation (sink).",
  "anomalies": "The code contains commented-out code for resizing images, which might indicate experimental modifications but nothing malicious. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious network activity. No obfuscated code features or hidden backdoors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard image quality assessment pipeline utilizing BRISQUE and NIQE metrics. It loads images, processes them, computes features, and compares these against precomputed statistical models. It saves model parameters for future use. There are no signs of code injection, backdoors, or malicious data handling. All operations appear consistent with legitimate image processing workflows. The code relies on well-known libraries (scikit-image, scipy, sklearn) and performs standard mathematical computations. No evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of image quality assessment algorithms with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage. It performs standard processing, feature extraction, and statistical analysis without any suspicious activities.",
