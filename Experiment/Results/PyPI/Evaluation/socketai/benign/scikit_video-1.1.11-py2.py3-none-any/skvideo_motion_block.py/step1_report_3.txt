{
  "purpose": "The code performs block-based motion estimation and compensation between frames in a video sequence using various search algorithms.",
  "sources": "The code reads input video frames, shape attributes, and potentially external utils; it also reads pixel data within functions like _costMAD and _subcomp.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain explicit sinks for untrusted data or actions like network communication, file writing, or command execution.",
  "flows": "Input frames are processed through motion estimation functions which compute motion vectors, then used in blockComp to generate motion-compensated frames.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors observed. The code uses standard NumPy functions for computation and does not perform obfuscated or misleading operations.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward implementation of multiple block matching motion estimation algorithms, including exhaustive, diamond, three-step, adaptive, and other methods. The functions _costMAD and _minCost compute costs and identify minimal matching blocks, and the main blockMotion function orchestrates the selection of algorithms based on input parameters. The code reads image data, performs calculations, and returns motion vectors and compensated frames. There are no signs of malicious activity such as network operations, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The use of environment variables or system calls is absent. All computations are standard image processing tasks. No evidence of obfuscated code or malicious logic found.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of various motion estimation techniques for video processing. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It mainly performs computational tasks using standard libraries without any suspicious side effects.",
