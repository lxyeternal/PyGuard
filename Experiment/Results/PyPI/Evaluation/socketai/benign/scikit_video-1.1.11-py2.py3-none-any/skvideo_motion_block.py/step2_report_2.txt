  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core points: presence of malicious activity, logical consistency, score justification, and any anomalies.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies that the code implements standard motion estimation algorithms, reading image data for processing.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks or network activity; data flows are confined to image processing.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected. The import from `..utils` is noted but not suspicious without further context.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-reasoned; code appears benign with high confidence.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1; confirms standard motion estimation algorithms.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leakage or network activity; purely computational.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns. The mention of `..utils` remains a potential concern but is speculative.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid; code appears legitimate.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the code performs block-based motion estimation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No evidence of external data leaks or network activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behaviors; standard numerical computations. The comment about \"BROKEN, check this\" for ARPS is benign.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-founded; benign code.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above; standard motion estimation tasks.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or network communication.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns; standard implementation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriate; no malicious activity.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 — no malware.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code's purpose.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks or network activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior; the code is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid assessment.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 — no malware.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Code Behavior:** All reports agree that the code implements standard, well-known block-matching motion estimation algorithms used in video processing.\n- **Malicious Indicators:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious data exfiltration.\n- **Potential Concerns:** The only minor point is the import from `..utils`, which could theoretically contain malicious code, but this cannot be assessed without further context. The code snippet itself is benign.\n\n**Scores Justification:**\n\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code analysis.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, which is correct; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk:** Given the absence of malicious activity, the risk score should be very low, around 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting standard code without known vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---|---|---|\n| **0** | **0** | **0.1** |\n\nThis reflects a benign, standard implementation of motion estimation algorithms with no security concerns based on the static code review.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is legitimate, with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The minor concern about the import path is not sufficient to raise the malware or risk scores. The recommended scores are malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.",
