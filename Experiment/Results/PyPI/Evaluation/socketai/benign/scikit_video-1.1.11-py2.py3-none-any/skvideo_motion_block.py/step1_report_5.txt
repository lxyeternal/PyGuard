  "purpose": "The code implements various block-matching motion estimation algorithms for video frame analysis, including methods like Exhaustive Search, 3-Step Search, Diamond Search, and others, to compute motion vectors between video frames.",
  "sources": "Reads image data from input frames, accesses pixel data within specified regions, and uses variables related to frame and block dimensions.",
  "sinks": "Performs computations based on pixel data; no explicit data leakage, network communication, or file modification present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input frames through various motion estimation functions where pixel regions are compared, and motion vectors are derived based on cost minimization functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hard-coded secrets, or backdoors detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or indirect data leaks observed. No system commands, network calls, or file access outside normal data processing. Environment variables are not used insecurely. The code appears to be standard motion estimation logic.",
  "analysis": "The code implements multiple classical block-matching motion estimation algorithms, with functions for cost calculation, boundary checking, and different search strategies. It uses numpy for numerical operations and processes image data primarily through pixel comparisons. No hardcoded credentials, network communication, or backdoor logic is present. The code's structure and variable usage are typical for video processing algorithms, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious system manipulation, or unauthorized data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of various block-matching motion estimation techniques, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs typical computational tasks related to video motion analysis. There are no security risks or malware indicators in the code.",
