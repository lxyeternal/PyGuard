  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and assess the validity of their claims, especially regarding malware, obfuscation, and security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Summary:** Implements standard motion estimation algorithms; no malicious activity or obfuscation detected.  \n- **Assessment:**  \n  - The code performs typical image processing tasks: reading image data, computing motion vectors, and motion compensation.  \n  - No network, file, or external system interactions are present.  \n  - The import of `..utils` is unspecified, but without evidence of malicious code, it’s likely benign.  \n  - The report's malware score of 0 aligns with the analysis.  \n- **Verdict:** Valid, no issues.  \n\n**Score justification:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 (low, due to potential external utils).  \n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1; standard motion estimation functions, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Assessment:**  \n  - The code is a straightforward implementation of multiple algorithms, with no signs of malicious activity.  \n  - The mention of the `'BROKEN, check this'` comment indicates incomplete implementation, not malicious intent.  \n  - The import from `'..utils'` remains a minor concern but unsubstantiated.  \n  - Malware score of 0 is appropriate.  \n- **Verdict:** Valid, no malicious activity.  \n\n**Score justification:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 (minimal).  \n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—standard algorithms, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Assessment:**  \n  - All functions perform expected image processing computations.  \n  - No network or system commands, no obfuscation.  \n  - The only potential concern is the `'..utils'` import, but without evidence, it remains speculative.  \n  - Malware score of 0 aligns with this.  \n- **Verdict:** Valid.  \n\n**Score justification:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 (still low).  \n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Summary:** Same overall conclusion—benign, standard motion estimation code.  \n- **Assessment:**  \n  - No suspicious code patterns or behaviors.  \n  - The code is purely computational, with no external communication or system modifications.  \n  - The import of `'..utils'` is noted but not confirmed malicious.  \n  - Malware score of 0 is justified.  \n- **Verdict:** Valid.  \n\n**Score justification:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.0-0.2 (very low).  \n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Summary:** Again, standard algorithms with no malicious indicators.  \n- **Assessment:**  \n  - No network, file, or external system interactions.  \n  - No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.  \n  - The code is a typical implementation of block-matching motion estimation.  \n  - Malware score of 0 is appropriate.  \n- **Verdict:** Valid.  \n\n**Score justification:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the static analysis. The code performs standard image processing functions without any signs of malicious activity such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified. The code is clear, with no obfuscation patterns.  \n- **Risk Score:** Very low across all reports, reflecting the benign nature of the code.  \n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0 — No malicious behavior detected.  \n**Obfuscated:** 0 — Code is straightforward and well-structured.  \n**Risk:** 0.1 — Minimal, primarily due to external utility import uncertainty.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard implementation of multiple block-matching motion estimation algorithms for video processing, with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is negligible based on static analysis.",
