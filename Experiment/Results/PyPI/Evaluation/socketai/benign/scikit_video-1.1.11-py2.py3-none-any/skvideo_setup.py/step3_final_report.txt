  "purpose": "The code defines a configuration function for the 'skvideo' package, adding several subpackages for setup or build purposes.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted data sources; static import from numpy.distutils.misc_util.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow from untrusted sources or network activity.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward package configuration with clear structure.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Configuration from numpy.distutils.misc_util, creates a configuration object for 'skvideo', adds subpackages ('io', 'datasets', 'tests', 'motion', 'utils', 'measure'), and returns it. It is a standard setup script with no suspicious or malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and no security risks. The code does not process external data, perform network operations, or contain hidden logic. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with high confidence (1), and assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which are justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package configuration script with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores and assessments in all reports are accurate and appropriate.",
