  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external outputs are evident in this code.",
  "flows": "The code initializes a configuration object and adds subpackages; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behaviors detected; code is straightforward package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Configuration from numpy.distutils, defines a function to set up a package 'skvideo', and adds several subpackages. It appears to be standard build configuration code without any obfuscated or malicious elements. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no network activities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using numpy utilities. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
