  "purpose": "Define and configure subpackages for the 'skvideo' Python package using numpy's distutils configuration utility.",
  "sources": "Imports 'Configuration' from 'numpy.distutils.misc_util'. No other data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could cause data leaks or security effects. The code mainly sets up package structure.",
  "flows": "Import of Configuration -> Creation of configuration object -> Addition of subpackages",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code performs standard package configuration without any suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard configuration utility from a well-known scientific library (numpy). It initializes a configuration object for the 'skvideo' package and adds several subpackages ('io', 'datasets', 'tests', 'motion', 'utils', 'measure'). The structure and methods used are typical for package setup scripts and do not include any malicious behavior or obfuscated code. There are no hardcoded credentials, network operations, or unusual behaviors present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package setup script that configures subpackages for distribution. It shows no signs of malicious intent, suspicious activity, or security risks.",
