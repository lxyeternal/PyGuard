  "purpose": "Utilities to handle motion in video",
  "sources": "Import statements importing modules '.block' and '.gme'",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data processing or output",
  "flows": "No data flow observed within this snippet; imports do not create data flows",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious variable names, or unusual code patterns; use of relative imports is typical in package code",
  "analysis": "The code defines a module that imports everything from two internal modules (.block and .gme) and exposes three identifiers via __all__. There are no functions, no data processing, no network calls, no input reading, and no suspicious operations. The code appears to be a straightforward utility module for video motion handling, with no indication of malicious intent or malicious code behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as an import interface for related modules without any suspicious or malicious code present. There are no security concerns or malware indications based on this snippet.",
