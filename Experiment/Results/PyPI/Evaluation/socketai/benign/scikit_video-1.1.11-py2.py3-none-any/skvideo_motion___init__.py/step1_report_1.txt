  "purpose": "Utilities to handle motion in video processing",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .block and .gme",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no data processing or untrusted data handling shown",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are evident as this code only contains imports and an __all__ declaration",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or suspicious constructs; only import statements and export list",
  "analysis": "The code imports all contents from two local modules (.block and .gme) and declares an export list. No data processing, network activity, or sensitive operations are present. The code appears to be a straightforward module aggregator or interface layer for video motion utilities. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module aggregator with no malicious intent or security issues. It only exports certain functions or classes from local modules related to video motion utilities, with no suspicious behavior observed.",
