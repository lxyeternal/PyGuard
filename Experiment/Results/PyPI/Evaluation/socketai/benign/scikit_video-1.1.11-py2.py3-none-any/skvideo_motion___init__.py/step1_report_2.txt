  "purpose": "Utilities to handle motion in video processing",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules '.block' and '.gme'",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks",
  "flows": "Imports data from internal modules, no external data flow or untrusted input processing",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; no obfuscated code or unusual language features",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports symbols from internal submodules '.block' and '.gme'. It defines a public API list '__all__' to specify exported functions or classes. There are no data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no external network communication. The code appears to be part of a larger package dedicated to video motion utilities. The import statements are relative, indicating internal dependencies, which are common in well-structured packages. No signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and appears benign. It serves as a module interface for video motion utilities without any malicious intent or security issues.",
