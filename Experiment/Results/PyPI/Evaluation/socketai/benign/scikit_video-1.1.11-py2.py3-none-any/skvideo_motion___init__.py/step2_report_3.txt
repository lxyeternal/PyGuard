  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code.\n\n**Code Summary:**\nThe code is a simple Python module that:\n- Imports everything from two local modules: `.block` and `.gme`.\n- Defines an `__all__` list exposing `'blockMotion'`, `'blockComp'`, and `'globalEdgeMotion'`.\n- Contains no functions, data processing, network activity, or other operations.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the Issues in the Code\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  The reports are consistent: the code is minimal, with only imports and an export list. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports\n- **Logical accuracy:**  \n  All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, straightforward, and only serves as an interface or aggregator for other modules.  \n  No errors or flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n### Score Evaluations\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.  \n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code.  \n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate.\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5\n- None of the reports assign a risk score higher than 0.5, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Malware and Malicious Behavior\n- **Are any claims about malicious activity justified?**  \n  No. The code contains only import statements and an export list, with no data flow, network activity, or suspicious constructs.  \n  The malware score should remain at 0.\n\n### Challenging Assumptions\n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n### Consistency of Scores\n- All scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment\nGiven the code and reports:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### My Expert Estimate:\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a straightforward module initializer with no data processing, no external communication, and no suspicious patterns. The reports correctly identify its benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate. The code is benign, and the scores should remain at zero across malware, obfuscated, and security risk categories.",
