  "purpose": "Utilities to handle motion in video",
  "sources": "Imports modules 'block' and 'gme' from the current package",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; no data output or external communication in this snippet",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow; only module imports and exports",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative imports; no explicit code execution or data handling; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple Python module defining utilities related to video motion handling. It imports all contents from 'block' and 'gme' modules within the package, and defines an __all__ list for exported symbols. There are no evident malicious activities such as network communication, data leakage, or backdoors. The code appears to be a straightforward module setup with no suspicious or anomalous behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, functioning as an interface to re-export certain functions or classes from internal modules. No signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks are present in this fragment.",
