  "flows": "No explicit data flow from sources to sinks; only module imports and exports",
  "anomalies": "Uses relative imports; no signs of obfuscation or hardcoded secrets",
  "analysis": "The code imports all contents from two local modules '.block' and '.gme', then defines an __all__ list specifying exported functions or classes. No user input handling, no network operations, no suspicious function calls or code constructs are present. The code appears to be a standard module initializer, serving as an interface for other modules. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module initializer with standard imports and exports. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
