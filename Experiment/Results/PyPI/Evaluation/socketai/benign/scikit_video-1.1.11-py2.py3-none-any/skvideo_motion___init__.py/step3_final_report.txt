{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer that imports all contents from internal modules (.block and .gme) and explicitly declares exported symbols ('blockMotion', 'blockComp', 'globalEdgeMotion') for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the import statements of .block and .gme modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; it does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports modules and defines an export list.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is straightforward, with no suspicious constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal module that imports everything from two internal modules and declares an explicit list of exported symbols. It contains no functions, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The import statements are relative, typical in package code, and do not indicate malicious intent. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior are detected. The code's simplicity and clarity suggest it is a benign component of a larger package. The assigned scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's nature. There are no indications of security risks or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's straightforward structure.",
