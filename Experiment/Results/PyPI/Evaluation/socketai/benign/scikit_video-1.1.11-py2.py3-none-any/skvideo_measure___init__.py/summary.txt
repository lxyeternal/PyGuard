  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module aggregator with no malicious or security-threatening behavior. The primary concern is stylistic (wildcard imports), which does not impact security. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score should be 0.1 due to stylistic issues. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use."
