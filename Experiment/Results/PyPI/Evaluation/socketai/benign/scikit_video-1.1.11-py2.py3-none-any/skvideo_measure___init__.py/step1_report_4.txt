{
  "purpose": "This module acts as an aggregator that imports various measurement and quality assessment tools for image/video quality metrics.",
  "sources": "Import statements from relative modules such as .msssim, .ssim, .strred, etc.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external network interactions; only module imports and variable definitions.",
  "flows": "Imports from local modules, then exports specific function or class names via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No obfuscated code or unusual language features observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules and an explicit list of exported symbols. It does not perform any data processing, input/output, or network operations. The naming suggests these are image/video quality metrics. No suspicious or malicious behaviors, such as data exfiltration, remote control, or cryptomining, are evident. The structure is typical for an __init__.py or module aggregator file. No anomalies or security concerns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module aggregator for quality assessment tools, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
