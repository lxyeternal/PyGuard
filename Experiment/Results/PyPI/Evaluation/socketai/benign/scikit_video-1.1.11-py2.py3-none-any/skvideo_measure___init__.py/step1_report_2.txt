{
  "purpose": "The code exports various image and video quality assessment functions and features for use in other modules.",
  "sources": "Imports all functions and classes from multiple local modules such as msssim, ssim, strred, etc.",
  "sinks": "Exports a list of string identifiers via __all__, no direct sink involving untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "Imported modules are exposed via __all__, no data flow analysis beyond module imports and exports",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected; all imports and exports are typical for a package index file",
  "analysis": "The script primarily serves as a module initializer, importing functions from local modules and defining __all__ for export. There are no input sources, data processing, or output sinks related to untrusted data. The imported modules are likely related to image/video quality metrics. No obfuscated code, malicious logic, or external communications are present. The structure and content are consistent with a standard package index file.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard package initializer exporting multiple quality assessment functions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. It is a benign module setup script.",
