{
  "purpose": "This module appears to be a package that imports various image and video quality assessment and measurement tools, likely for use in image/video analysis tasks.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules such as .msssim, .ssim, .strred, .psnr, .mse, .mae, .scene, .brisque, .videobliinds, .viideo, .niqe, .Li3DDCT",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or output within this code snippet. The code only imports modules and defines __all__.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks are evident in this snippet; it only sets up module imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated constructs, are present. The import statements and __all__ list appear standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward __init__.py style module that imports multiple functions/classes from sibling modules and defines an export list. It does not execute any untrusted input, perform network operations, or manipulate data. The naming suggests standard measurement tools, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. All imported modules are presumed to be part of a quality assessment library. No anomalous or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module initializer for a quality assessment package. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The structure is typical for Python package __init__.py files.",
