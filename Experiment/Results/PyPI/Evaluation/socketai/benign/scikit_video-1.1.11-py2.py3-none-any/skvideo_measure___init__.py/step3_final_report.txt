{
  "purpose": "Aggregator module importing various image/video quality assessment functions for export.",
  "sources": "Local module imports via wildcard statements, no external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Import statements; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports; module names like 'videobliinds', 'viideo', 'Li3DDCT' are unusual or potentially misspelled.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a benign package initializer, importing multiple quality metrics modules and defining __all__ for exports. Wildcard imports are stylistically discouraged but not malicious. No external data handling, network activity, or obfuscated code detected. Module names may be typos but do not indicate malicious intent. The overall structure is standard for a package's __init__.py file, with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module aggregator with no malicious or security-threatening behavior. The primary concern is stylistic (wildcard imports), which does not impact security. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score should be 0.1 due to stylistic issues. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use.",
