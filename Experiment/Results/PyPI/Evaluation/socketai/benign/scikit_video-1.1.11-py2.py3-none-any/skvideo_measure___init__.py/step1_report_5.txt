{
  "purpose": "The code exports multiple image and video quality assessment modules for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports modules from relative package paths, potentially reading their code or data at import time.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or external communications are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident; the code primarily sets up imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected; straightforward module imports and list definition.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various modules related to image and video quality metrics using relative imports. It then defines an __all__ list to specify public API exports. There are no functions, no data handling, no network operations, or suspicious constructs present. All imported modules appear to be standard for a package that deals with quality assessment tools. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are evident. The structure is simple and typical for Python package __init__.py files.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign module initializer, setting up exports for a package related to quality metrics. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
