  "purpose": "Compute NIQE scores for video frames by extracting statistical features from patches and comparing them to pre-trained parameters to assess image quality.",
  "sources": "Loading parameter data from 'niqe_image_params.mat'; reading input video frames; extracting patches; computing MSCN transforms.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or network activity; computations are purely local statistical analyses.",
  "flows": "Input frames -> feature extraction (patches, MSCN transforms) -> statistical comparison with model parameters -> NIQE score output.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated 'scipy.misc.imresize' function; no malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard NIQE image quality assessment: loading pre-trained parameters, extracting features from image patches, computing Mahalanobis distances, and returning quality scores. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The only concern is the deprecated 'imresize' function, which is a maintenance issue but not security-related. The code is clear, well-structured, and relies on common scientific libraries. External parameter files are standard for such models. No network activity or hidden behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of NIQE with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The minor concern about deprecated functions does not indicate security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is approximately 0.1 due to maintenance considerations. Confidence in this assessment is high (~0.9).",
