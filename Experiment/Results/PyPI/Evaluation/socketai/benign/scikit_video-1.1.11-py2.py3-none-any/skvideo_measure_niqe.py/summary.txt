  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of NIQE with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The minor concern about deprecated functions does not indicate security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is approximately 0.1 due to maintenance considerations. Confidence in this assessment is high (~0.9)."
