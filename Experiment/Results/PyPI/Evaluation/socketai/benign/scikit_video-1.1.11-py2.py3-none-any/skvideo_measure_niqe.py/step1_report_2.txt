{
  "purpose": "The code computes the Naturalness Image Quality Evaluator (NIQE) score for each frame of a video, used for assessing image quality based on natural scene statistics.",
  "sources": "Reads input video data (ndarray of shape T, M, N, C), loads a MATLAB parameters file 'niqe_image_params.mat', and imports utility functions from '..utils'.",
  "sinks": "Performs matrix operations on features and covariance matrices, but no direct data leak or system effect is evident.",
  "flows": "Extracts features from input frames -> computes mean and covariance of features -> compares with pre-trained parameters -> outputs NIQE scores.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'scipy.misc.imresize' which is deprecated; no obvious malicious code present, but reliance on external data files and deprecated functions could pose maintenance or security concerns. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors detected. Commented code suggests possible previous experimentation but is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code performs image quality assessment using statistical models of natural images. It reads input data, processes it to extract features, compares features to pre-trained parameters, and computes scores. No code injection, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. External data loading from a MATLAB file is standard for such algorithms. The use of deprecated 'scipy.misc.imresize' is a potential maintenance concern but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, unusual behaviors, or obfuscation are detected. The functions operate solely on input data and pre-trained parameters, with no hidden or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of the NIQE image quality metric, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs feature extraction, statistical comparison, and scoring as intended without malicious side effects.",
