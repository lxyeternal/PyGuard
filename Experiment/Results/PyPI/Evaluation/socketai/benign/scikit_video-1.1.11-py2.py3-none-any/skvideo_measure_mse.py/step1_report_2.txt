{
  "purpose": "The code computes the mean-squared error (MSE) between two videos, primarily for quality assessment.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the parameters 'referenceVideoData' and 'distortedVideoData'. It also imports modules 'numpy' and 'scipy.ndimage', and uses a function 'vshape' from the parent utils module.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or external data exfiltration. The code performs internal calculations and assertions without external communication.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through the 'vshape' function (presumed to reshape data), then into calculations of MSE per frame, with results stored in an array and returned.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes an assertion that limits the number of channels to 1, indicating a focus on luminance; no other suspicious code or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data processing for video quality metrics. It imports necessary libraries, processes input data shapes, asserts data dimensions, and calculates per-frame MSE. There are no signs of code injection, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious data handling. The import of 'vshape' from an external utils module is typical for modular code. All operations are standard numerical computations for MSE, with no external network activity or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of a video quality metric calculation without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
