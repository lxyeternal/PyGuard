  "purpose": "Compute per-frame mean squared error (MSE) between reference and distorted videos, assuming single-channel luminance data.",
  "sources": "Input video data arrays, processed via vshape utility for shape normalization.",
  "sinks": "Internal computation; no external data transmission or effects.",
  "flows": "Input data -> vshape reshaping -> shape validation -> per-frame MSE calculation -> output scores.",
  "anomalies": "Assertion enforcing C==1; reliance on external vshape utility; no suspicious code or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard per-frame MSE calculation for video quality assessment, with proper shape validation and data type conversions. No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious elements are present. The assertion ensures luminance-only processing, typical for perceptual metrics. The import of vshape from a utils module is standard, assuming it reshapes data appropriately. No external communication, data leaks, or malicious logic are detected. The scores assigned in the critical reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation of a video quality metric with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate; the malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk score close to 0. The existing assessments are justified, and no modifications are necessary.",
