  "purpose": "Compute the mean-squared error (MSE) between reference and distorted video frames for quality assessment.",
  "sources": "Imports from '..utils', input video data arrays 'referenceVideoData' and 'distortedVideoData'.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is used in insecure or malicious ways; calculations are straightforward numeric operations.",
  "flows": "Input data is reshaped by 'vshape', then iterated per frame to compute mean squared error, with no external data output or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Usage of 'vshape' is presumed standard, but its implementation is not provided; assuming it just reshapes data.",
  "analysis": "The code imports utilities and numerical libraries, then defines a function to calculate MSE per frame between two videos. It enforces that videos have a single channel, indicating focus on luminance. Data is reshaped, validated for shape equality, and processed in a loop. All operations are mathematical and limited to local computations without network or system modifications. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code are present. The 'vshape' function's purpose is assumed to be data reshaping, which is standard. No insecure handling or suspicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard video quality metric computation with no indications of malicious activity or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate utility function for quality assessment with no malicious intent.",
