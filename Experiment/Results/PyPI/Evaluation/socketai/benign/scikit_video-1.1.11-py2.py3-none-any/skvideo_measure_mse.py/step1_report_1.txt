{
  "purpose": "The code computes the mean-squared error (MSE) between reference and distorted videos, frame-by-frame, for quality assessment.",
  "sources": "Input video data: referenceVideoData and distortedVideoData parameters, read as ndarray.",
  "sinks": "The code performs numerical operations and does not write or transmit data externally.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded into arrays, reshaped, and used in calculations without external data transmission or command execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors. The only assertion enforces single-channel input, which is a standard requirement for luminance-based metrics.",
  "analysis": "The function starts by reshaping inputs with vshape, which likely standardizes the input dimensions. It asserts both inputs have the same shape and only one channel, implying a focus on luminance. The core computation iterates over frames, calculating the mean squared error for each frame, which is straightforward. No external network, system calls, or data leaks are present. The imported libraries are common scientific packages (numpy, scipy.ndimage) used for numerical operations. No malicious or suspicious code behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard MSE calculation for video quality assessment, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It relies on standard scientific libraries and straightforward logic, with an assertion to ensure proper input format.",
