  "purpose": "The function computes the mean-squared error (MSE) between reference and distorted video frames, specifically for luminance channel comparison.",
  "sources": "The code reads input video data via the parameters 'referenceVideoData' and 'distortedVideoData'. It also imports functions from a relative utils module.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that handle untrusted data in a way that would cause leaks or malicious effects. No data is transmitted over networks or written to files.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through shape adjustments and assertions, then per-frame calculations, and outputs a score array.",
  "anomalies": "The code imports a module from a relative path ('..utils') but does not use it explicitly within the function. The use of an assertion to enforce channel count and data type conversions are standard. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious operations are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to compute MSE between two video datasets. It relies on an external 'vshape' function (assumed to normalize input shapes). It enforces the input to have a single channel (likely luminance), which is common in perceptual quality metrics. The implementation is straightforward: shape adjustment, assertion, per-frame difference calculation, and return of an array of scores. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The import from a relative utils module does not raise suspicion without evidence of misuse. Overall, the code performs a standard image quality metric calculation without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of a video quality metric calculation. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks present.",
