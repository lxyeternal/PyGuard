{
  "purpose": "Calculate mean-squared error (MSE) between reference and distorted video data, frame-by-frame, primarily for quality assessment.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the input parameters 'referenceVideoData' and 'distortedVideoData', which are numpy arrays representing video frames.",
  "sinks": "The code processes data internally with numpy; no sinks for untrusted data or network transmission are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from parameters into 'vshape' function, then into calculations within the loop, producing an output array of MSE values.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code structures are present. The only assertion enforces that only luminance (C=1) is processed, which is a standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code imports utility functions and numpy, performs shape adjustments with 'vshape', and calculates per-frame MSE for luminance channel videos. The presence of 'from ..utils import *' suggests reliance on external utility functions, but 'vshape' is presumably a helper that reshapes data appropriately. No malicious logic such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors is evident. The assertions enforce expected data formats and channel count, indicating validation rather than malicious intent. Overall, this appears to be a standard, safe quality metric implementation with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for calculating per-frame MSE for luminance videos. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. The code is safe and intended solely for video quality assessment.",
