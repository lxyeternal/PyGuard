      "conclusion": "Most reports demonstrate suspicious patterns such as obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and hardcoded secrets, which justify moderate to high security concern. While no explicit malicious payloads are confirmed, the presence of these indicators warrants caution. Slight upward adjustments to malware and risk scores for reports with high obfuscation and suspicious activity are recommended to better reflect potential threats."
