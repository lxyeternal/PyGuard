{
  "purpose": "Custom installation process that runs shell commands and potentially makes HTTP requests during package installation.",
  "sources": "Commented out HTTP request code; os.system calls executing 'ls -l /', 'which curl', 'which wget', and 'touch /tmp/pytest2'.",
  "sinks": "os.system commands that execute system shell commands, potentially allowing code execution or information disclosure if manipulated.",
  "flows": "Any environment or system info (e.g., environment variables) could be captured by the commented curl commands (if uncommented) and sent to external domains; system commands can be exploited to execute arbitrary commands.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system with fixed commands that list system directories and create files in /tmp, which could be used maliciously. Commented out code for HTTP request and further curl commands could indicate intent to exfiltrate data if enabled.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, during package installation, runs several system commands. It attempts to list root directory contents, check for presence of 'curl' and 'wget', and create a temporary file. Commented code suggests potential for network activity and data exfiltration via curl commands, but these are inactive. The active commands are mostly benign system info collection, but the pattern of executing shell commands and the commented-out code indicates potential for malicious activity if re-enabled or modified.",
  "conclusion": "While the current active code appears to perform system diagnostics (listing directories, checking for tools), the structure and commented code suggest an ability to perform network data exfiltration and execute arbitrary commands, which could be malicious if re-enabled or altered. Overall, low to moderate suspicion based on current code, but the pattern warrants caution.",
