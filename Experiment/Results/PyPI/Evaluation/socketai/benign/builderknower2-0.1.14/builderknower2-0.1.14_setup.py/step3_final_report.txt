{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom installation command that executes system commands during package installation, including listing root directory contents, checking for 'curl' and 'wget', and creating a temporary file. Commented-out code suggests previous or potential malicious activities such as network requests and data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Execution of system commands via os.system during install; reading environment variables (implied by commented curl commands); potential input from environment or system state.",
  "sinks": "System commands that can leak system info or modify files; commented-out network requests that could exfiltrate data if enabled.",
  "flows": "During installation, the code runs system commands that could gather system info or create files, with potential for data leakage or system modification if malicious code is activated.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system to execute commands during package setup; presence of commented-out code for network requests and data exfiltration; creation of files in sensitive directories; all in a setup script, which is unusual and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code executes benign-looking system commands during installation, such as listing directories and checking for utilities. Commented-out code indicates prior or potential malicious activities like making HTTP requests to suspicious domains and exfiltrating data via curl commands. No active malicious payloads are present, but the pattern of executing system commands and the presence of commented malicious code suggest a potential for misuse if modified. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated. The commands could be used for reconnaissance or data collection if re-enabled. The commented-out network requests, if activated, could lead to data leaks or malicious control. Overall, the code presents a moderate security concern due to its pattern and potential for malicious activity if altered.",
  "conclusion": "The current code is benign but exhibits patterns (system command execution, commented malicious code) that could be exploited for malicious purposes if modified. The scores reflect low active malware presence but acknowledge potential misuse. Caution is advised when deploying or distributing this package.",
