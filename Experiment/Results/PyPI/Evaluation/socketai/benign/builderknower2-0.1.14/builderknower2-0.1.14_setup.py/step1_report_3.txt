{
  "purpose": "The code customizes the installation process for a Python package, including executing system commands during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables and system commands via os.system calls within the CustomInstallCommand.run() method.",
  "sinks": "The system commands executed can access environment variables and system information, and the outputs are directed to files (e.g., LICENSE, /tmp/pytest2).",
  "flows": "Environment variables and system command outputs could potentially be captured or misused if commands are maliciously altered; however, the code as-is simply collects system info.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of commented-out code that makes HTTP requests to suspicious domains, and execution of commands like 'ls -l /' and 'which curl/wget' during install. The commented requests code could indicate an attempt to exfiltrate data or check system state, but currently inactive.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install command that executes several system commands during package installation, such as listing root directory contents, checking for curl and wget, and touching a temporary file. There are commented-out sections that could have been used for network requests or data exfiltration. The active commands do not exhibit malicious behavior themselves but could be used to gather system info. The presence of commented code pointing to potentially malicious URLs suggests previous or potential malicious intent, but in its current state, it primarily collects system info without exfiltrating data or executing harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not appear to contain active malicious behavior in its current form but includes commented code and commands that could be used for reconnaissance or data collection. Overall, it poses low risk but warrants monitoring for any modifications.",
