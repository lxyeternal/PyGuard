  "purpose": "A simple Python function returning a static string with no external dependencies or inputs.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data from external sources.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no untrusted data outputs or external data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the function simply returns a static string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function that returns a fixed string. All reports correctly identify its benign and trivial nature, with no external data handling, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent across reports. No issues or suspicious patterns are present, and the code poses no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
