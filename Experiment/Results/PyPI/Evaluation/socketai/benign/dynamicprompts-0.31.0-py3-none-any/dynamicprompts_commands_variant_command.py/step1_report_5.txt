{
  "purpose": "Define a set of classes for handling variant commands with different options and weights, likely for use in prompt generation or selection.",
  "sources": "None explicitly reading input or untrusted data sources; the code mainly creates objects and manipulates internal data structures.",
  "sinks": "No sink functions or external calls; the code constructs objects and yields combinations internally.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; functions generate data internally or via method calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data classes for variant options and commands, with methods for constructing and manipulating these variants. The methods involve data validation and combination generation but do not perform any external operations, system calls, or network activity. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code appears purely focused on data structure management and combinatorial generation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a structured way to manage command variants. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior, nor does it interact with external data sources or sinks. No security risks or malware signals are evident.",
