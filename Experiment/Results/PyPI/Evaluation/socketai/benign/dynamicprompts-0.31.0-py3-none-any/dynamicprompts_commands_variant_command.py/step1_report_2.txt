{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes and methods for handling variant command options, including creation, adjustment, and combination generation, likely for prompt manipulation in a dynamic prompt system.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from literals (string list) passed to the from_literals_and_weights method, class attributes (variants, min_bound, max_bound, separator, sampling_method), and internal method calls.",
  "sinks": "There are no clear sinks where untrusted data is directly used in a vulnerable or malicious manner such as executing system commands, writing files, or network operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user-supplied literals and weights into command objects via from_literals_and_weights, then used internally for generating combinations without any apparent untrusted data execution or system interaction.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors, such as obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or suspicious data handling, are present. Assertions are used for validation, which is standard. No hardcoded credentials or network calls are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily constructs data classes for managing command variants and their options, with methods for validation, range adjustment, and combination generation. It uses standard Python features and typing, with no network, file, or environment variable operations. The get_value_combinations method recursively generates combinations without side effects. The code appears clean, straightforward, and aligned with its intended purpose, with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured utility for handling prompt command variants. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious data handling, or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate within its context.",
