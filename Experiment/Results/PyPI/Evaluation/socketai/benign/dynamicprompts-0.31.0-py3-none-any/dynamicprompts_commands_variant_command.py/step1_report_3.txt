{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes and methods for managing variant commands, including selection, combination, and manipulation of command options for dynamic prompt generation.",
  "sources": "Imports modules, including standard libraries (dataclasses, logging, typing) and project-specific modules (dynamicprompts.commands and enums). No input or external data reading sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is used in security-sensitive operations; no network connections, file writes, or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows are confined within object properties and method calls, primarily manipulating lists and command objects. No untrusted input flows into critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or hardcoded secrets. The code uses standard data management and class design patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data classes for variant options and commands, with methods for creating variants from literals, adjusting ranges, and generating combinations. It performs input validation (asserts) and uses standard Python features without any dynamic execution, network activity, or environment variable manipulation. There are no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior, and it functions as part of a larger command processing system. No anomalies or security concerns are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, well-structured component for handling command variants in a dynamic prompt system. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified. It is a standard implementation for managing command options and generating combinations without any suspicious or harmful code.",
