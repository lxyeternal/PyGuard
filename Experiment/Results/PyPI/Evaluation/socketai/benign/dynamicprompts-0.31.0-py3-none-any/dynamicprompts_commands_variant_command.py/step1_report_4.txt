{
  "purpose": "Define a set of classes for handling variant commands with options, weights, and sampling methods, primarily used for generating combinations of command values.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, dataclasses, logging, typing, and internal modules (dynamicprompts.commands.base, dynamicprompts.commands.literal_command, dynamicprompts.enums). No user input or external data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network operations, file writes, system commands, or evaluation of untrusted input are present in this code.",
  "flows": "Data flows involve creating command variants and generating combinations internally; no data is processed from untrusted sources or passed to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated language features, or dynamic code execution. The code is straightforward data structure and generator logic without suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines immutable data classes to represent command options and variants, methods to generate and manipulate these variants, and a method to produce combinations of command values. It uses assertions for input validation, but no external or untrusted data handling, no network or file operations, and no code execution based on external input. The code appears to be a clean, standard implementation for managing command options. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign implementation of command variant handling with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It does not include any external data sources, network communications, or hidden functionalities.",
