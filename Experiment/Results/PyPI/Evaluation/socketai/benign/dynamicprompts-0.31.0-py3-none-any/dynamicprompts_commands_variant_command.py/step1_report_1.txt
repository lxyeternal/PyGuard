{
  "purpose": "Defines a set of classes for managing variant command options, including range adjustment, creation from literals, and combination generation, likely for prompt variation.",
  "sources": "Imports modules, especially from dynamicprompts.commands and dynamicprompts.enums, and uses class and method parameters.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks for untrusted data or potential malicious output. No data leaks, network calls, or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method parameters (literals, weights, min/max bounds) into internal Command objects; no external data flow or untrusted input processing is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. Assertions are used for validation but are standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data classes for command variants, with methods for adjusting ranges, creating variants from literals and weights, and generating combinations. No dynamic code execution, network access, or data leakage mechanisms are present. It uses standard Python features and well-understood patterns. All operations are confined within the class methods and data validation logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for managing command variants with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs straightforward data handling and combinatorial logic without external threats.",
