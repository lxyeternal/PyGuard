{
  "purpose": "The code manages command variants, range adjustments, creation from literals, and combination generation for command options.",
  "sources": "Input literals, weights, and class parameters such as min_bound, max_bound, separator, and sampling_method.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data flows; internal data handling only.",
  "flows": "Data flows from literals and weights into VariantOption objects, then into VariantCommand, with internal methods generating combinations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs; assertions are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of command variant management using data classes. It handles input data safely, performs range adjustments, and generates combinations recursively. There are no external system calls, network operations, or data leaks. The code's clarity and lack of external dependencies indicate a benign purpose. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The assertions and type annotations are standard practices. Overall, the code demonstrates safe, maintainable design without security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for managing command variants and generating combinations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score should be 0, reflecting its safe and straightforward nature.",
