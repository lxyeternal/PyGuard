{
  "purpose": "The code manages prompt sampling contexts, variable assignments, and prompt generation for a prompt-based system, providing mechanisms for sampling strategies, variable handling, and prompt iteration.",
  "sources": "Parsing prompt strings, variable assignment commands, and sampling method selections.",
  "sinks": "Generator outputs producing sampled prompts, variable values, and sampling results.",
  "flows": "Input prompts are parsed into commands, which are then sampled or processed to produce outputs; variable commands influence subsequent prompt generation; sampling methods determine how prompts are generated.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Use of warnings and dynamic imports are benign. No hardcoded secrets or insecure patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured prompt management system with context handling, variable processing, and sampling strategies. It employs standard Python practices, with safeguards against recursion and invalid sampling method nesting. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The use of warnings is appropriate for informing about sampling method conflicts. The generator functions and variable processing are straightforward and safe. No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are detected. The code handles untrusted input cautiously, with recursion checks and type validations. Overall, the code appears legitimate, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured component for prompt sampling and variable management, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low malware and security risk scores are justified. The code poses minimal security concerns and does not exhibit any supply chain risks.",
