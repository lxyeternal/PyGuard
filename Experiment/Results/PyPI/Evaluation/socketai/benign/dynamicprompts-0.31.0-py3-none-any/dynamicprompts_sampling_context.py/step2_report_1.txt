  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; describes the class and functions managing sampling, variables, and prompts.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correct; data flows from parsing/commands to generator outputs.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. Use of warnings is benign.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid; code appears legitimate.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, overall reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The reasoning is sound, and the low malware and security risk scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns; use of warnings is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriate.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The assessment aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious activity; standard parsing and sampling.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** No concerns. The reasoning is consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious activity; use of warnings and dynamic imports are benign.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriate.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; the low security risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior; generator usage is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** No concerns; reasoning aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code analysis—no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation but generally low (0.1–0.2), justified by the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores across all reports are reasonable and consistent with the detailed reasoning.\n- No modifications are necessary.\n- The code is a standard prompt management system with no signs of supply chain risks or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity present.\n\n**Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear, well-structured, and not obfuscated.\n\n**Risk:** 0.1 — very low, considering the code's purpose and lack of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports' assessments are accurate; the code appears safe and legitimate.",
