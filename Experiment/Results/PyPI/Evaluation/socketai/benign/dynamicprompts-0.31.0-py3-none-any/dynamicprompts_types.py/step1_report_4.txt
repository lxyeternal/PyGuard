{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to convert an iterable of SamplingResult objects or strings into generators that yield SamplingResults or strings respectively.",
  "sources": "The functions read from an iterable 'values' which can contain SamplingResult instances or strings.",
  "sinks": "No external or untrusted data is processed or output; the functions simply yield processed data.",
  "flows": "Input iterable -> type check -> yield SamplingResult or string -> output generator",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected. No external system calls, network activity, or data exfiltration routines.",
  "analysis": "The code defines type aliases and two functions, 'to_result_gen' and 'to_string_gen', which convert an iterable containing SamplingResult objects or strings into generators yielding either SamplingResult instances or strings. The functions perform type assertions to ensure data consistency. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated patterns, no dynamic execution, and no external dependencies beyond type annotations and simple logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility module for data conversion and contains no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and no security risks. It appears safe and benign.",
