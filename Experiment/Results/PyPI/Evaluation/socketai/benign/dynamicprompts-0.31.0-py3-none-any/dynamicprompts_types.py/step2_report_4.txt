  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Summary of reports:**\n- All reports describe the code as utility functions converting iterables of `SamplingResult` objects or strings into generators.\n- They emphasize the straightforward, type-safe, and benign nature of the code.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, external dependencies, or malicious behavior are identified.\n- The reports consistently assign a malware score of 0, with minimal security risk (around 0.1 or 0).\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code matches the description: simple type checks, generator functions, no dynamic code execution, no network calls, no obfuscation.\n- The functions only perform data conversions with assertions for type safety.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leakage.\n\n### Flaws or issues:\n- The code appears correct and secure based on the provided context.\n- Assertions are used for type validation, which is standard and does not introduce security issues.\n- No evidence of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n### Scoring analysis:\n- **Malware score:** All reports give 0, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports give 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** Given the benign nature, a low risk score (~0.1) seems appropriate, mainly reflecting that the code is utility in nature and unlikely to be exploited.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores seem reasonable and consistent across reports.\n- No adjustments needed based on the current analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (since it's utility code, not security-sensitive, but still part of a supply chain)\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, with no security risks or malware.**",
