  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting iterables of SamplingResult objects and strings into generators of SamplingResults or strings.",
  "sources": "The code reads from input iterables 'values' which contain either SamplingResult objects or strings.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct data sinks that process untrusted data in a harmful way; the code primarily converts data types.",
  "flows": "Input iterable 'values' flows into conversion functions, which yield SamplingResult objects or strings based on type checks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present. Assertions for type safety are used, but they are standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code defines type aliases and two conversion functions, 'to_result_gen' and 'to_string_gen'. These functions iterate over provided input iterables containing either 'SamplingResult' instances or strings. They yield appropriately converted objects or texts, ensuring type safety through assertions. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. The code is straightforward and appears intended for data transformation within a larger system.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data transformation utility with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It performs type-safe conversions between 'SamplingResult' objects and strings, with no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
