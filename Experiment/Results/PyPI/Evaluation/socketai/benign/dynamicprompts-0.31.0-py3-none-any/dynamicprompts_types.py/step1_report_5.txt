  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to convert iterables of SamplingResult objects or strings into generator objects, facilitating data processing pipelines for sampling results.",
  "sources": "Input iterables of SamplingResult or str objects passed to 'to_result_gen' and 'to_string_gen' functions.",
  "sinks": "The functions yield SamplingResult objects or strings, which could be used downstream for further processing or display.",
  "flows": "Input iterables (containing SamplingResult or str) → functions ('to_result_gen', 'to_string_gen') → generators that yield processed SamplingResults or strings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code performs straightforward type checking and data conversion without any unusual or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines type aliases for various generator and iterable types related to SamplingResult objects and strings. Two functions, 'to_result_gen' and 'to_string_gen', convert iterable inputs of SamplingResult or str into generators yielding SamplingResult objects or strings, respectively. Type assertions ensure inputs are of expected types, aiding in type safety. The functions are simple, with no external data access, network calls, or security-sensitive operations. There are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for data transformation within a larger application. It contains no malicious behavior, no evidence of sabotage, and performs straightforward, safe data processing. The likelihood of malicious intent is extremely low.",
