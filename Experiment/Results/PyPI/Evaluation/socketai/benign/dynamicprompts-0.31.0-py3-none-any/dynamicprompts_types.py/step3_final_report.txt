  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting collections of SamplingResult objects and strings into generators with type safety.",
  "sources": "Iterable inputs of SamplingResult or str, used within the functions for type checking.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; functions only yield data, no external system interaction.",
  "flows": "Input iterable -> type check -> yield SamplingResult or str -> output generator.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward type assertions and generator functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple generator functions with runtime type assertions to convert iterables of SamplingResult or str into generators of SamplingResult or str respectively. No external dependencies, network activity, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. Assertions serve as input validation, not security vulnerabilities. The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility module performing data type conversions with standard validation. No malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues are detected. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
