  "purpose": "Utility functions to convert between different iterable types of SamplingResult objects and strings",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'values' in 'to_result_gen' and 'to_string_gen' functions",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data leaks identified; the code processes in-memory data only",
  "flows": "Input iterable (SamplingResult or str) -> type check -> yield conversion to SamplingResult or string",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present. Assertions are used for type validation, which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines type aliases and two functions for converting iterables containing SamplingResult objects or strings into generators that yield either SamplingResult objects or strings. The functions include type assertions to ensure data consistency and perform simple type checks before yielding. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious code execution. The code operates solely on provided data without external dependencies or network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward utility module for data type conversions with no malicious or security concern. It does not contain obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior, and the assertions serve as input validation.",
