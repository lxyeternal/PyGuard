  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting iterable collections of SamplingResult objects and strings into generator objects, primarily for processing or transformation within a larger application.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'values' in 'to_result_gen' and 'to_string_gen' functions, which are iterables of SamplingResult or str.",
  "sinks": "Generators yielding SamplingResult objects or strings; no direct data sinks that process untrusted input into vulnerable operations.",
  "flows": "Input iterable -> type check -> yield SamplingResult or string -> output generator.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard type assertions and generator patterns are used without obfuscation or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines type aliases and two functions that convert an iterable of SamplingResult or str into corresponding generators. Both functions perform runtime type assertions to ensure data integrity before yielding. The functions are straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, no input/output beyond generator yields, and no malicious or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, standard, and free of malicious behavior or security risks. It acts as utility code for data conversion, with no indications of supply chain threats or malware.",
