  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of the code in the codebase:**\n   - All reports describe a single line: `__version__ = \"0.31.0\"`.\n   - This line is a typical version declaration in Python modules.\n   - There are no inputs, data flows, or external interactions.\n\n2. **Logical and security assessment:**\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation are observed.\n   - The code is straightforward and serves a metadata purpose.\n   - No signs of malicious activity, such as code injection, obfuscated payloads, or external data handling.\n\n3. **Scores and their appropriateness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0 (not obfuscated)\n     - `malware`: 0 (no malware detected)\n     - `securityRisk`: 0 (no security risk)\n   - These scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n4. **Potential issues or assumptions:**\n   - No issues are present or implied; all reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No need to adjust scores.\n\n5. **Overall assessment:**\n   - The code is a standard version string assignment.\n   - No malicious or security-related concerns are present.\n   - The malware score remains at 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The obfuscated score remains at 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The security risk score remains at 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Final conclusion:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is purely metadata with no security implications.\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a straightforward version declaration with no malicious or suspicious behavior. No changes to scores are necessary.",
