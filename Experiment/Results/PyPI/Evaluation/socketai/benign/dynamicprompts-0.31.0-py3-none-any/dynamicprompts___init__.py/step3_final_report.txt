  "purpose": "This code declares a version string for a Python package, serving as metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it is a static assignment.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions affecting external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is a simple assignment statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single line assigning a version string to __version__, a common practice in Python packages. It involves no input handling, data flow, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless, standard version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. The existing scores are appropriate and should remain unchanged.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
