  "anomalies": "Single line defining a version string; no unusual or suspicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code solely assigns a string value to a variable named '__version__'. This is a common practice in Python packages for versioning. No external input, no data processing, no security-sensitive operations are present. The code appears straightforward and typical for package metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves a standard purpose of version annotation without any malicious intent or security risks.",
