  "flows": "No data flows, as the code only assigns a string to a variable.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no anomalies observed.",
  "analysis": "The code only sets a version string variable '__version__' to '0.31.0'. There are no inputs, no functions, no dynamic code, and no suspicious patterns. It is a typical version declaration used in Python packages for metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version declaration with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
