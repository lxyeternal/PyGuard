{
  "purpose": "Defines constants and initializes a Random object for use in the application.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; constants are hardcoded, and the Random object is instantiated locally.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; code does not process untrusted input or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; initialization is static with no dynamic data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard Python constructs and no obfuscation or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code imports annotations, defines several constants, and creates a Random instance. It contains no input/output, no data processing, and no suspicious patterns. The use of Random() is typical for non-cryptographic randomness and does not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation, secrets, or external interactions are present. The code is a benign setup snippet, likely part of a larger application.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 (due to the use of Random(), which is harmless here). Overall, it poses no security threat.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
