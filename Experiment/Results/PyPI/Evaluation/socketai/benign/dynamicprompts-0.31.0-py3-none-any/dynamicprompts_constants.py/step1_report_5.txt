  "purpose": "Define default constants and initialize a Random instance for use in a larger application.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources are present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No data output, external calls, or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow exists in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Use of the 'Random' class is neutral; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up constants for encoding, joiner string, and maximum images, along with a global Random object. There are no inputs, external data handling, or security-sensitive operations. The use of 'from __future__ import annotations' is a standard Python feature for postponed evaluation of annotations, unrelated to security concerns. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment appears to be straightforward setup code defining constants and initializing a Random object, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
