{
  "purpose": "Define constants and initialize a default random number generator for use within a larger Python project.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no operations that handle untrusted data or output data to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks as no input or data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a `Random()` object initialization which could be used for randomization purposes; no anomalies or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future annotations for type hints, sets some default constants for encoding, joiner, and maximum images, and initializes a Random object. All elements are standard and do not show any suspicious or malicious behavior. No input reading, data leakage, or malicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward setup for a larger module, defining constants and initializing a random generator without any malicious intent or security issues.",
