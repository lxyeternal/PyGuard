{
  "purpose": "Define some constants and initialize a random number generator for use in a larger Python project.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; only constant definitions and object instantiation.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; no data processing or transfer.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from __future__ import annotations' is standard and not suspicious. The instantiation of 'DEFAULT_RANDOM = Random()' is typical for random operations but could be used for unpredictable behavior if misused.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of constant definitions and a standard random number generator instantiation. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated behavior. No sensitive information or environment variables are accessed or manipulated. The code appears benign and typical for setup in a larger codebase.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It sets constants and initializes a random generator, which is common in many Python projects.",
