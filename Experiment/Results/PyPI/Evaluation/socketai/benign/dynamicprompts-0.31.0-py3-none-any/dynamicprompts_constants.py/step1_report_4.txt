{
  "purpose": "Define default constants and initialize a random number generator",
  "sources": "None (no input reading or data input points present)",
  "sinks": "None (no untrusted data output or effect points present)",
  "flows": "No data flow paths from source to sink due to lack of input/output operations",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious code patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports annotations for type hints, imports a standard Random class, and defines some constants. There is no evidence of input reading, data leakage, or untrusted data handling. The Random instance is a standard library object used for random number generation. Constants are straightforward and do not indicate malicious intent. No dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a configuration or constants setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
