  "purpose": "Define some default constants and initialize a random number generator.",
  "sources": "No input sources or data reading points in this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leakage points present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks since no data reading or output is performed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns observed; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future annotations, defines default constants for encoding, joiner, and max images, and initializes a default Random object. All elements are standard Python practices for setting default configurations or constants. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code appears benign and intended for general use within a larger application context.",
  "conclusion": "This code is safe, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply establishes constants and a random generator, typical for configuration or utility purposes.",
