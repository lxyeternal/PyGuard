  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for sampling methods with an additional method to check for non-finite sampling types.",
  "sources": "Enum class attributes, class variable NON_FINITE_SAMPLING_METHODS",
  "sinks": "Method is_nonfinite potentially used to determine sampling behavior; no direct sink of untrusted data",
  "flows": "Enum members are checked against NON_FINITE_SAMPLING_METHODS in is_nonfinite method",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior observed; code structure is straightforward and standard",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Enum for sampling methods and includes a method to determine if the sampling method is non-finite by checking membership in a set. The set NON_FINITE_SAMPLING_METHODS is defined after the method, which is acceptable in Python because the method accesses the class attribute, but it could lead to issues if not handled properly. However, in this context, it is correctly ordered because the method accesses the class attribute. The code does not contain obfuscated code, malicious instructions, or suspicious patterns. It appears to be a standard implementation of an enum with a helper method.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, straightforward enum definition with a utility method. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. The code's structure is standard and poses no security threat.",
