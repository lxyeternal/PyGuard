  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for different sampling methods and a method to check if a sampling method is non-finite.",
  "sources": "The enum values assigned to SamplingMethod members, the is_nonfinite() method accessing NON_FINITE_SAMPLING_METHODS.",
  "sinks": "The is_nonfinite() method which could be called with untrusted enum values, but currently there are no direct sinks that lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "The is_nonfinite() method checks if 'self' is in NON_FINITE_SAMPLING_METHODS; however, 'self' is an enum instance, and the set contains enum members, so flow is straightforward.",
  "anomalies": "Order of definitions: NON_FINITE_SAMPLING_METHODS is defined after the class, which might cause a NameError if is_nonfinite() is called before the set is defined. No other anomalies observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Enum class with three members representing sampling methods. It includes a method is_nonfinite() that checks if the current enum instance belongs to a predefined set of non-finite sampling methods. The set NON_FINITE_SAMPLING_METHODS is defined after the class, which may lead to a NameError if the method is invoked before the set is initialized. There are no signs of malicious code, data leakage, or obfuscation. Usage appears to be straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, well-structured, and performs a basic enum check. There is a potential issue with the order of definitions that could cause runtime errors, but no malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
