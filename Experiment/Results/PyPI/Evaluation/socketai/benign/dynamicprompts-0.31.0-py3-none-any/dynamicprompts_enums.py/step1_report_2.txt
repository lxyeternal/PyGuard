  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for different sampling methods with a method to check if a sampling method is non-finite.",
  "sources": "The Enum class attributes and the NON_FINITE_SAMPLING_METHODS set, which are used internally within the class method.",
  "sinks": "The is_nonfinite() method, which returns a boolean based on membership in NON_FINITE_SAMPLING_METHODS.",
  "flows": "The is_nonfinite() method checks if 'self' (an instance of SamplingMethod) is in NON_FINITE_SAMPLING_METHODS.",
  "anomalies": "The set NON_FINITE_SAMPLING_METHODS is defined after the class referencing it, which could lead to a NameError at runtime. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. No code injection or suspicious data flows observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Enum for sampling methods with a method to check if the current method is non-finite, based on a set. The set is defined after the class, which might cause a NameError if the method is called before the set is initialized. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are present. The code uses standard language features and clear logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward enumeration definition with a method to check membership in a set. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The main issue is a potential runtime error due to the order of definitions, not malicious behavior.",
