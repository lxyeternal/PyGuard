  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for different sampling methods with an associated method to check for non-finite types.",
  "sources": "The enum values and the method is_nonfinite() which checks membership in NON_FINITE_SAMPLING_METHODS.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or external inputs are present.",
  "flows": "The is_nonfinite() method flows from the enum instance to a membership check in NON_FINITE_SAMPLING_METHODS.",
  "anomalies": "The NON_FINITE_SAMPLING_METHODS set is defined after the class, but used inside a class method. This could lead to a NameError at runtime unless the code is executed in a specific order. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Enum class with three sampling methods. It includes a method to determine if a sampling method is non-finite by checking membership in a set. The set NON_FINITE_SAMPLING_METHODS is defined after the class, which might cause runtime errors due to reference before assignment, but this is a structural issue, not malicious. The code performs standard enum and set operations without external input processing or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward enumeration with a membership check method. There are no indications of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The only minor concern is the ordering of definitions, which could cause runtime issues but does not impact security.",
