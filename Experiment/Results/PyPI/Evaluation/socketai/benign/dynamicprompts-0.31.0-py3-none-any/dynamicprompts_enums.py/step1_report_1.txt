  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for different sampling methods with a method to check if a sampling method is non-finite.",
  "sources": "Enum class attributes and the is_nonfinite method accessing the NON_FINITE_SAMPLING_METHODS set.",
  "sinks": "The is_nonfinite method could be invoked with untrusted enum values, but it only performs a membership check.",
  "flows": "Potential flow from enum instance to the is_nonfinite method, which checks membership in a predefined set.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a set of enum members for membership testing, which is standard. No suspicious code or secrets are present. The order of definitions is correct, with the set defined after the class.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Enum class SamplingMethod with three members. It also defines a set NON_FINITE_SAMPLING_METHODS containing two of these enum members. The method is_nonfinite checks if the enum instance is in this set. The code appears to be a straightforward, safe enumeration definition with a simple membership check. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious code. The structure is clear, and no external data or inputs are used. No hardcoded credentials or data leakage mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard and safe implementation of an enumeration with a helper method to check membership in a predefined set. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
