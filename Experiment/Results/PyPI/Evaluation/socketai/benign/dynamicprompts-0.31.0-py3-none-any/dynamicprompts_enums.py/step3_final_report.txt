  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration for sampling methods with a helper function to identify non-finite methods.",
  "sources": "The enum members and the method is_nonfinite() accessing the NON_FINITE_SAMPLING_METHODS set.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code is purely declarative.",
  "flows": "The method is_nonfinite() checks membership in NON_FINITE_SAMPLING_METHODS when called.",
  "anomalies": "The set NON_FINITE_SAMPLING_METHODS is defined after the class, which could cause a runtime NameError if the method is invoked before the set is initialized.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward enum with a membership check method. The main concern is the ordering of the set definition after the class, which may lead to a runtime error if is_nonfinite() is called before the set is defined. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The potential error is structural, not security-related.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe and clear, with a minor structural issue regarding the order of definitions that could cause runtime errors but does not constitute a security risk or malware. The scores should reflect no malicious activity (0), no obfuscation (0), and a very low security risk (0.1) due to potential runtime errors. To fix this, define NON_FINITE_SAMPLING_METHODS before the class or within it to ensure proper initialization order.",
