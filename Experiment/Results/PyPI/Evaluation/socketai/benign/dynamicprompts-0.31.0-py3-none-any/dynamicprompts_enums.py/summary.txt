  "conclusion": "The code is safe and clear, with a minor structural issue regarding the order of definitions that could cause runtime errors but does not constitute a security risk or malware. The scores should reflect no malicious activity (0), no obfuscation (0), and a very low security risk (0.1) due to potential runtime errors. To fix this, define NON_FINITE_SAMPLING_METHODS before the class or within it to ensure proper initialization order."
