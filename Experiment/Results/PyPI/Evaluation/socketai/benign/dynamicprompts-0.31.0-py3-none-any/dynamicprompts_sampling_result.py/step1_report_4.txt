  "purpose": "Defines a dataclass SamplingResult for handling and manipulating sampled text data, including joining, replacing, and wrapping operations.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, dataclasses, typing, and functions from dynamicprompts.commands.wrap_command and dynamicprompts.utils modules.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or untrusted data handling; the code processes text internally and calls external utility functions.",
  "flows": "Uses input text in various methods to produce modified SamplingResult objects, especially in as_wrapper() and joined() methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. External utility functions are imported but not shown; their safety cannot be guaranteed but are not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dataclass for managing sampled text with methods for string manipulation and composition. It imports utility functions for whitespace normalization, string splitting, prefix/suffix removal, which are typical for text processing. No data is read from external sources or network, and there are no unsafe operations or code injections. The functions appear to serve straightforward text processing purposes without malicious intent. External dependencies are standard or utility-based, not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module for text manipulation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It uses standard Python practices and external utility functions, which seem safe. There are no indications of malware or malicious logic.",
