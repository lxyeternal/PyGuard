  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Utility class for handling sampling results, string manipulation, wrapping.\n- Sources: Static attributes, imported utility functions.\n- Sinks: No external data handling, only internal string operations.\n- Flows: Data flows internally; no external untrusted data involved.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious patterns, no code execution, no secrets.\n- Analysis: Well-structured, standard utility code, safe.\n- Conclusion: No malicious behavior, minimal security risk.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar utility class for sampling results.\n- Sources: Imports utility functions, no external data.\n- Sinks: No external output or untrusted data handling.\n- Flows: Internal string manipulations, no external data flows.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious behaviors.\n- Analysis: Benign utility code, safe.\n- Conclusion: No security risks, benign.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Same as above, handling string results.\n- Sources: Same utility functions, no external data.\n- Sinks: No external data handling.\n- Flows: Internal data processing.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious code or obfuscation.\n- Analysis: Straightforward, safe utility code.\n- Conclusion: No malicious activity.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Utility class for text manipulation.\n- Sources: Imports standard and utility modules.\n- Sinks: No untrusted data or external system interaction.\n- Flows: Internal string data manipulation.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious patterns.\n- Analysis: Typical utility functions, safe.\n- Conclusion: No security concerns.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Utility for sampling result management.\n- Sources: Imports utility functions.\n- Sinks: No external data or system interactions.\n- Flows: Internal string operations.\n- Anomalies: No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n- Analysis: Straightforward, safe utility code.\n- Conclusion: No security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code presence:** All reports describe a class for string manipulation, with no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Malware potential:** None detected; the code is purely utility-focused.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Security risk:** Very low; no external data, network, or command execution.\n- **External functions:** The imported functions (split_wrapper_string, squash_whitespace, removeprefix, removesuffix) are standard utility functions; their implementations are not shown but are presumed safe.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with benign utility code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Given the lack of external data handling, network activity, or code injection, a low risk score (around 0.1) remains appropriate.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- No claims or evidence suggest any vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n- The code appears to be standard, well-structured, utility code for internal processing.\n- No assumptions are made beyond what is shown; external utility functions are assumed safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall recommendation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (consistent with minimal internal utility code)\n\nThis assessment aligns with the provided reports and the code's nature.",
