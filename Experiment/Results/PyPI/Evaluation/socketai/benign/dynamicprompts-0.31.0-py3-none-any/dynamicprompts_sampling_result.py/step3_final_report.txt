  "purpose": "Utility class for managing sampling results with string manipulation, wrapping, and joining functionalities.",
  "sources": "Internal attributes, imported utility functions (split_wrapper_string, squash_whitespace, removeprefix, removesuffix).",
  "sinks": "No external data sources or sinks; internal string operations only.",
  "flows": "Data flows within the class methods, manipulating the text attribute and utilizing utility functions for string processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a frozen dataclass 'SamplingResult' with methods for string squashing, replacement, wrapping, and joining. It relies on external utility functions presumed safe. No external data fetching, network calls, or command executions are present. The 'as_wrapper' method creates a function to wrap a SamplingResult with prefix and suffix derived from the text, which could theoretically be misused if the inner data is malicious, but the code itself is benign. The joining method handles concatenation with separator, removing prefix/suffix if needed. Overall, the code is straightforward, well-structured, and free of malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for string handling within sampling results. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The potential for misuse exists if the data passed into the methods is malicious, but the code itself does not facilitate malicious actions. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.1) are justified and appropriate.",
