  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for string handling within sampling results. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The potential for misuse exists if the data passed into the methods is malicious, but the code itself does not facilitate malicious actions. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.1) are justified and appropriate."
