{
  "purpose": "Define a dataclass for handling sampling results with utility methods for text manipulation and composition.",
  "sources": "Imports from dynamicprompts.commands.wrap_command and dynamicprompts.utils; usage of properties and methods that manipulate strings.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly identified; no untrusted input handling, network operations, or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Methods process internal string data, including splitting, replacing, joining, and squashing whitespace. No flow involves untrusted external input leading to critical actions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. The use of internal utility functions is standard, and there are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated patterns, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dataclass 'SamplingResult' with methods for string manipulation and composition, including whitespace squashing, text replacement, and joining. It imports functions for splitting wrapper strings and removing prefixes/suffixes, used within methods. The 'joined' method handles multiple results and preserves separators if only one result is provided. There are no network calls, data leaks, or code injections. The code appears to be straightforward utility code for text processing, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions for managing sampling result text data, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It performs safe string operations and internal data management without external side effects or suspicious behaviors.",
