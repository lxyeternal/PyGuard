{
  "purpose": "Defines a data class SamplingResult for handling and manipulating text sampling results, including string operations and formatting.",
  "sources": "Imports modules, particularly split_wrapper_string and utility functions (squash_whitespace, removeprefix, removesuffix) that process or transform text.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no untrusted data outputs or external calls with untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "The class methods manipulate the 'text' attribute directly; the 'as_wrapper' method creates a wrapper function that combines SamplingResults, but no external data flow to untrusted sources is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. Usage of dynamic imports is standard here.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data class for sampling results, with methods for string processing, deduplication, wrapping, and joining. No external input/output sources or sinks are present. The code relies on imported utility functions, but their implementations are not shown; assumed safe. No evidence of malicious intent such as network access, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears to serve as a text processing utility within a larger application, with no suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility class for managing text sampling results with no malicious activity or security risks observed. It operates solely on internal data and well-defined utility functions, with no external data flows indicating potential security concerns.",
