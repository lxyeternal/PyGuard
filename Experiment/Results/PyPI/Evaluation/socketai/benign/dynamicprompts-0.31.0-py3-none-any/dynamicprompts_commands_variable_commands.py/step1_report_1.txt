  "purpose": "Define data classes for variable assignment and access commands used in a dynamic prompts system.",
  "sources": "import statements, class attribute definitions",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data handling or external data output",
  "flows": "No dynamic or untrusted data flows observed within the code",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present",
  "analysis": "The code defines two immutable data classes inheriting from Command, representing variable assignment and access commands. It imports standard and third-party modules without executing any dynamic code or data processing. No external data sources or sinks are involved. The structure appears standard and aligned with typical command pattern implementations, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of command data structures with no malicious behavior, no suspicious patterns, and no security concerns detected.",
