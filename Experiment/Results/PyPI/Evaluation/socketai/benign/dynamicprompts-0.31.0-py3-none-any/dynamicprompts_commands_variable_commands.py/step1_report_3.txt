{
  "purpose": "Define immutable command classes for variable assignment and access in a dynamic prompt system.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules, including 'dynamicprompts.commands', and class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data is being sent to external systems or outputs within this code.",
  "flows": "Class definitions primarily establish data structures; no data flow from external sources to sinks is present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, such as dynamic execution, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines two data classes, 'VariableAssignmentCommand' and 'VariableAccessCommand', both inheriting from 'Command'. These classes are simple data containers with specified fields and default values. There is no dynamic code execution, input handling, or external communication. The design appears to be a straightforward implementation of command data structures for a larger system. No signs of malicious behavior, such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or hidden operations, are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign definition of command data structures for variable management within a prompt system. It does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior. No security risks or malware indications are present.",
