{
  "purpose": "Defines data classes for variable assignment and access commands in a dynamic prompts framework.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, dataclasses, and dynamicprompts.commands module.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data processing or external data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; data classes are purely structural.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features, dataclasses, and a command base class. It defines two immutable data classes: VariableAssignmentCommand and VariableAccessCommand, with clear fields for variable names, values, defaults, and control flags. There are no external inputs, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The structure appears standard and well-formed, serving as part of a larger command framework. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward data class definitions for command structures without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malicious behavior, external data flows, or anomalies indicative of malware.",
