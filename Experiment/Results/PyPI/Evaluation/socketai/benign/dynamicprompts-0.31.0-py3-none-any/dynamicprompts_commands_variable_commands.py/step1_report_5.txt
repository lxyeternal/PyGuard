{
  "purpose": "Define command classes for variable assignment and access within a dynamic prompt system.",
  "sources": "No input sources; code relies on imported modules and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or output to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; class definitions are static and do not process external data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated elements, or hardcoded secrets. Use of dataclasses and inheritance appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two dataclasses, VariableAssignmentCommand and VariableAccessCommand, inheriting from Command. Both classes are immutable (frozen=True) and contain straightforward attributes. There are no data processing, external input handling, or malicious operations such as network activity, file manipulation, or code execution. The code appears to be part of a command framework for managing variables, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, benign class definition for command objects related to variable handling. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
