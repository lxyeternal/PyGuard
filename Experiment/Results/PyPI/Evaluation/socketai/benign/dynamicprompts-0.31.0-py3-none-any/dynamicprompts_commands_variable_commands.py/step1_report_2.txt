{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures for variable assignment and access commands within a dynamic prompts framework.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and defines dataclass structures; no input reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or output points present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; data structures are static definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs. Usage of 'Command' as a base class is standard for command pattern implementations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future annotations for compatibility, imports dataclasses for defining immutable data structures, and references a 'Command' class from an external module. It defines two immutable dataclasses: 'VariableAssignmentCommand' with fields for variable name, value, immediate execution flag, and overwrite behavior, and 'VariableAccessCommand' with fields for variable name and an optional default value. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or network operations are present. The structure appears to be straightforward, typical for command pattern implementations in scripting or prompt frameworks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard and safe, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It serves as data structure definitions for a prompt command system without performing any dangerous actions.",
