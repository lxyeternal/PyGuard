{
  "purpose": "Defines immutable data classes for variable assignment and access commands within a command pattern system.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, dataclasses, and dynamicprompts.commands; class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external outputs; no data flows to external systems or network.",
  "flows": "Class attribute assignments do not involve data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; no dynamic execution or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two immutable data classes inheriting from a Command base class, serving as data containers for variable management. It imports standard modules and an external command module. There is no dynamic code execution, input/output handling, network activity, or external data processing. The structure is typical for command pattern implementations. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and clarity indicate a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of command data classes for a larger system. It does not perform any malicious actions, handle untrusted data, or contain security flaws. The scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0 are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
