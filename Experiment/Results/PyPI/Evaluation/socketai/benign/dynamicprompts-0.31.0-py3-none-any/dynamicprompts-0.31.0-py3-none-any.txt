      "conclusion": "The code is safe and clear, with a minor structural issue regarding the order of definitions that could cause runtime errors but does not constitute a security risk or malware. The scores should reflect no malicious activity (0), no obfuscation (0), and a very low security risk (0.1) due to potential runtime errors. To fix this, define NON_FINITE_SAMPLING_METHODS before the class or within it to ensure proper initialization order."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports—malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or very close—are accurate and appropriate. Slight elevations in security risk scores (0.1 or 0.2) are conservative and do not reflect actual threats. Overall, the code is safe, straightforward, and free of malicious or obfuscating elements."

The low malware and security risk scores are justified. The code poses minimal security concerns and does not exhibit any supply chain risks."

The potential for misuse exists if the data passed into the methods is malicious, but the code itself does not facilitate malicious actions. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.1) are justified and appropriate."
