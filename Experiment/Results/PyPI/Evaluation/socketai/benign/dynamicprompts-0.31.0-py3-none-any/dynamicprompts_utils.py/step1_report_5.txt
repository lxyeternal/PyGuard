{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for string manipulation, iterable processing, and random selection, likely used for managing prompt samples or data processing in a larger system.",
  "sources": "Input data includes string parameters for removal or processing (e.g., prefix, suffix, whitespace), iterables such as ResultGen objects, and lists for selection.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leak points include the use of random choices which could influence selection unpredictably, but no direct data leaks or network activity are present.",
  "flows": "Input strings processed in string functions; ResultGen objects cycled through or combined; random choices influence output in select functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are observed. No obfuscated code, external network calls, or file manipulations are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily implements standard utility functions for string handling, iterable cycling, and weighted random selection. Functions like 'choose_without_replacement' use Python's 'random.choices' for probabilistic selection, but without any network or file operations. No code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior detected. The presence of imports like 'dynamicprompts' suggests integration with prompt generation, not inherently suspicious. Overall, the code appears safe, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code consists of benign utility functions for string and iterable processing, and a weighted random selection method. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are identified, and the code seems intended for use in a larger prompt or data management system without security risks.",
