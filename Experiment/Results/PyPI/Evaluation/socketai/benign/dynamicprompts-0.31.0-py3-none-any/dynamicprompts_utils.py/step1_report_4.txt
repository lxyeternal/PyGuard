{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for string manipulation, iteration, and selection in the context of dynamic prompt sampling.",
  "sources": "None of the functions read untrusted input; functions operate on provided parameters or internal logic.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network, file, or environment variable usage are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows are internal to the functions, with no external data or untrusted sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed. The code is standard utility functions with clear, non-malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code provides helper functions such as string prefix/suffix removal, whitespace squashing, line checks, deduplication, generator rotation, Cartesian product, weighted random selection, and combination of generators. All functions operate on data passed as parameters, with no external inputs, network calls, or file operations. There is no indication of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The usage of random and itertools is standard, and no obfuscated or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of benign utility functions intended for internal use within a larger system for prompt generation or processing. There are no signs of malware, malicious code, or security risks.",
