{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for string manipulation, iteration, and sampling, used within a larger dynamic prompt generation system.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input arguments such as strings, lists, and iterables passed to functions. No external data sources are directly accessed.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write to external systems, files, or network destinations. It primarily manipulates data in-memory.",
  "flows": "N/A – the functions are isolated utilities with no external side effects or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors detected. Use of random choices is standard for sampling. No obfuscated or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for string processing, list deduplication, rotation of generator results, and weighted random selection. No external input handling, network activity, or system modifications are present. The random module is used in a typical manner for sampling purposes, and the functions are straightforward, well-structured, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions intended for data manipulation within a larger system. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
