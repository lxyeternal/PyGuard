{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for string manipulation, data deduplication, generator rotation, and weighted random selection, likely used in a larger dynamic prompt generation system.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function parameters such as strings, lists, and iterables. No external input sources are explicitly used within this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not write to files, network, or other external systems. No untrusted data is processed in a way that leads to security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Data flows involve input parameters being processed through utility functions. The only notable flow is the weighted random choice, which uses internal lists and the random module; no external or untrusted sources are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The code appears to be straightforward utility functions with no hidden or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions for string manipulation (removing prefixes/suffixes, whitespace squashing), line checks, deduplication of lists, generator rotation, joining results, generating multiple next values from iterators, creating pairwise combinations, and weighted random selection. No external data sources, network operations, or system modifications are involved. The usage of the 'random' module for weighted choices is standard and does not indicate malicious intent. The functions are well-structured, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It performs basic data manipulations and random selections without any harmful operations. No malware signals or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
