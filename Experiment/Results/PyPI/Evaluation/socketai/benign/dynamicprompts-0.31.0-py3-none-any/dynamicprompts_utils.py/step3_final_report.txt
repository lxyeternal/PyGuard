  "purpose": "Utility functions for string manipulation, iterable processing, and weighted random selection, intended for data processing within larger systems.",
  "sources": "Function parameters such as input strings, lists, and iterables; no external data sources or sinks.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leak points are minimal; the code uses randomness for sampling, which could influence unpredictability but does not leak data.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through functions; no external data flows or network interactions are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, using standard Python libraries without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises utility functions for string processing, list deduplication, generator rotation, Cartesian product, and weighted sampling. It operates solely on passed-in data, with no external data handling, network activity, or side effects. The use of 'random.choices' is standard for sampling and does not introduce security issues. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are present. The functions are clear, well-structured, and serve typical purposes in data processing or prompt generation contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports—malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or very close—are accurate and appropriate. Slight elevations in security risk scores (0.1 or 0.2) are conservative and do not reflect actual threats. Overall, the code is safe, straightforward, and free of malicious or obfuscating elements.",
