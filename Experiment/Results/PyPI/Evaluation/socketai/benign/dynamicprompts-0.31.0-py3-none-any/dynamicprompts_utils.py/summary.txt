  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports—malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or very close—are accurate and appropriate. Slight elevations in security risk scores (0.1 or 0.2) are conservative and do not reflect actual threats. Overall, the code is safe, straightforward, and free of malicious or obfuscating elements."
