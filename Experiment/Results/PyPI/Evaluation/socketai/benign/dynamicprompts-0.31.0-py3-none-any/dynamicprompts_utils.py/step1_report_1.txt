{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for string manipulation, iteration, and sampling, likely used within a larger application involving prompt generation or processing.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads input or data from external sources; all functions operate on parameters passed to them.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that send data over networks, write to files, or perform other side effects are present.",
  "flows": "The functions perform local transformations and iterations without external data flow or untrusted input handling that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. No code injection, data leakage, or insecure operations are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides string utility functions, iterable transformations, and sampling functions with weights. It uses safe standard libraries and appears to be straightforward utility code. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no external data reading, or harmful operations. The sampling functions use Python's standard 'random' module without unusual patterns. No data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign set of utility functions intended for string processing and sampling within a larger project. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
