  "purpose": "Utility functions for prompt generation, including randomness, permutations, wildcards, and a Jinja2 extension for prompt blocks.",
  "sources": "Environment globals ('wildcard_manager', 'generators', 'prompt_blocks'), standard libraries, dynamically imported modules ('dynamicprompts.generators', 'dynamicprompts.wildcards').",
  "sinks": "Generator functions' generate methods, appending to 'prompt_blocks', returning generated prompts.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment globals into generator functions, with outputs returned or appended to 'prompt_blocks'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic imports within functions and reliance on environment globals could be manipulated if environment is compromised, but no malicious activity is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions and a Jinja2 extension for prompt handling, relying on external modules and environment globals. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The use of standard randomness functions and straightforward code indicates benign intent. The primary concern is trust in environment globals and external modules, which could be exploited if compromised, but the code itself does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a utility module for prompt generation. No evidence of malware or obfuscation is detected. The main security consideration is the trustworthiness of environment globals and external modules, but within this context, the code itself is safe.",
