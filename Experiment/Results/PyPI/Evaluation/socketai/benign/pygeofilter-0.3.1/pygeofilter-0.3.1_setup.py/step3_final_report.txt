  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for pygeofilter, handling dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'READTHEDOCS' and the README.md file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or file manipulation beyond reading static files.",
  "flows": "Environment variable influences conditional dependency inclusion; no malicious data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; typical setup script with environment variable check for build environment.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script, with standard practices such as environment variable checks and file reading. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected. Dependency management based on environment variables is common for documentation builds. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or code injection present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The environment variable usage is standard and safe. All signals indicate a secure, well-structured setup configuration.",
