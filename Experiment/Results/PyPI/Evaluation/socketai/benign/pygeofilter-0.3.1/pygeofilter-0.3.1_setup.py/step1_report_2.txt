{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for the Python package 'pygeofilter', intended to install and configure the package with its dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'READTHEDOCS', reads 'README.md' file, and uses static package metadata.",
  "sinks": "Environment variable 'READTHEDOCS' influences conditional dependency installation; reading 'README.md' file may expose local or sensitive info if misconfigured.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'READTHEDOCS' -> conditional dependency list; 'README.md' -> 'readme' variable used in setup description.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variable 'READTHEDOCS' to conditionally modify dependencies is typical in build scripts, not suspicious; no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present; no hardcoded credentials or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools, with environment variable check to disable dependencies during documentation build on ReadTheDocs. It reads a local README.md file for the long description. All code constructs are typical for package setup. No suspicious or malicious patterns, backdoors, or hidden behaviors are detected. The environment variable control is a common pattern to avoid dependency issues during documentation builds and not indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It carefully manages dependencies based on the build environment and uses typical setup configurations. No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are identified.",
