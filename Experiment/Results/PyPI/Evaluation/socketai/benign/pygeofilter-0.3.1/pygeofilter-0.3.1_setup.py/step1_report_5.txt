  "purpose": "This script is intended to set up and install the pygeofilter Python package, including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables ('READTHEDOCS'), reads the 'README.md' file, and defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None of the code explicitly writes or transmits untrusted data; no insecure or malicious sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Environment variable check influences conditional dependency inclusion; reading 'README.md' is a safe file operation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscated code are present. The environment variable check is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical setup procedures for a Python package. It reads an environment variable to conditionally include dependencies, reads a README file for the long description, and defines package metadata and dependencies. There are no suspicious code patterns, obfuscated elements, or malicious logic. It appears to be a standard setup script following best practices, with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
