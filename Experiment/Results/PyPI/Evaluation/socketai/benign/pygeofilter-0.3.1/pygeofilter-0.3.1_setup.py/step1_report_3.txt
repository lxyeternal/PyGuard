{
  "purpose": "The code sets up and configures the installation process for the pygeofilter Python package, including dependency management and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables ('READTHEDOCS'), reading the 'README.md' file, and importing modules such as os, setuptools.",
  "sinks": "None of the data flows or input sources directly lead to security-sensitive operations like executing untrusted code, storing secrets, or network connections.",
  "flows": "Environment variable check influences conditional dependency inclusion; reading 'README.md' influences long_description content.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious behavior detected. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup procedures typical of Python package configuration scripts. It conditionally adds dependencies based on environment variables, reads a README file for documentation purposes, and defines package metadata. All operations are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. The environment variable 'READTHEDOCS' is checked to modify dependencies for documentation building, which is common practice. No code injection, external network calls, or data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily handles package configuration and dependency management in a safe manner.",
