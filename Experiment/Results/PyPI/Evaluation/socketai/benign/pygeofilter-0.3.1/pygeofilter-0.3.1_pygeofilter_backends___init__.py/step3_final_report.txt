  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code reading environment variables, user input, external modules, network/file operations, package metadata.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file system access, environment variables, package data.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks include data read from environment/user input flowing into network/file operations and package info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is either absent or describes standard, benign operations such as environment variable access, package metadata reading, and network interactions. No malicious indicators or suspicious behaviors are evident. Confidence levels are high where code is described, and scores reflect the lack of malicious activity. The risk scores are low, justified by the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "All reports are consistent and appropriate. The absence of code leads to zero malware and obfuscation scores. The low security risk scores (0.2) are reasonable given the context. No revisions are necessary; the assessments are justified and cautious.",
