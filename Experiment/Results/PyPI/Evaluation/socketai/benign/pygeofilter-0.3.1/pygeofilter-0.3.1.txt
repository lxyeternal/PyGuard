      "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only minor security consideration is the potential for ReDoS in pattern matching if user input is maliciously crafted, which is a known and manageable risk. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscated at 0, and the security risk at approximately 0.1, reflecting this minor concern. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use in supply chain contexts with standard precautions."

The main security consideration is the potential execution of malicious code via external handlers, but this risk is external to the code itself. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score can be conservatively set around 0.1 to account for external handler trust boundaries."
