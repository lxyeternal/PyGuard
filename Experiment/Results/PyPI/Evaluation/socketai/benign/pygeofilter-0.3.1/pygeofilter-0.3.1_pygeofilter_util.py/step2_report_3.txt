  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** The code is standard utility functions for parsing durations, dates, datetimes, and pattern conversion. No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious activity detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no issues found. The code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar utility functions, with an emphasis on potential regex ReDoS vulnerabilities if malicious patterns are provided. The code relies on standard libraries, with no external data fetching or malicious intent.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (due to potential ReDoS if patterns are malicious)\n- **Assessment:** The concern about ReDoS is valid, but the code itself is safe unless the pattern input is malicious. The functions are standard, and no obfuscation or malicious code is present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same as above; utility functions with standard regex pattern handling. The IdempotentDict is benign.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (similar reasoning)\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior detected. The slight security risk stems from the potential for ReDoS if user-controlled patterns are malicious, but the code itself is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Utility functions with standard pattern parsing. No malicious activity or obfuscation. The regex pattern handling is complex but standard.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Assessment:** The code is benign, with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar utility functions. The only noteworthy point is the approximation of months and years to fixed days, which could lead to inaccuracies but not security issues.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (due to potential pattern matching issues, but not malicious)\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0. The code is straightforward utility functions with no malicious payload, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 in all reports; the code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports due to potential ReDoS or pattern matching inaccuracies, but these are not security breaches, just limitations or considerations.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No evidence of malicious code or activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — The code is clear, well-structured, and standard.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — Minor security consideration regarding regex pattern handling, but not a significant threat.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign utility module with no signs of supply chain compromise, malware, or obfuscation. The small security risk relates to potential regex ReDoS if user-controlled patterns are malicious, which is a common consideration in pattern matching code but not an active threat in this context.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Estimated Value |\n|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Malware         | 0               |\n| Obfuscated      | 0               |\n| Security Risk   | 0.1             |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus across the reports.",
