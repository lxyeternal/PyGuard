  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only minor security consideration is the potential for ReDoS in pattern matching if user input is maliciously crafted, which is a known and manageable risk. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscated at 0, and the security risk at approximately 0.1, reflecting this minor concern. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use in supply chain contexts with standard precautions."
