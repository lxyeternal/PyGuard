{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for parsing ISO 8601 durations, dates, datetimes, and converting SQL-like patterns to regular expressions. Also defines an idempotent dictionary class.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters (strings for parsing functions, pattern strings for regex functions). No external data sources or untrusted input streams identified.",
  "sinks": "Uses regex compilation and matching, which could be manipulated if pattern strings are malicious, but this is standard usage. No external system commands or sensitive data output.",
  "flows": "Pattern strings are processed and compiled into regex objects. No untrusted data flow to external systems or network.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code behavior detected. The regex functions handle pattern transformations but do not perform any malicious actions. The idempotent dictionary always returns the key, which is benign and non-malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions for parsing durations, dates, and datetimes, and converting pattern strings into regex objects. The functions employ standard Python libraries and regex operations. No external data sources, system calls, or network activity are present. The pattern functions handle string manipulation and regex compilation without any signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The idempotent dictionary is a benign class that always returns the key, which can be useful for specific use cases but is not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility module for parsing and pattern matching, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious commands. The functions operate solely on input parameters and standard libraries.",
