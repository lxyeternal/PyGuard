  "purpose": "Evaluator and optimizer for spatial, temporal, and attribute AST nodes in geospatial filtering.",
  "sources": "AST nodes, literals, geometries, function arguments, attribute references",
  "sinks": "Geometric operations, function calls, comparisons, logical combinations",
  "flows": "Data from literals/geometries through evaluation functions to final boolean or AST node outputs",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard AST evaluation and optimization for spatial-temporal queries, utilizing shapely for geometry conversions and standard operator mappings. No external network calls, secret handling, or obfuscation are present. The logic handles literals and AST nodes safely, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious data flow. The scores assigned in the initial reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's structure and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured spatial-temporal AST evaluator and optimizer with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The security risk is minimal, and the scores are appropriate.",
