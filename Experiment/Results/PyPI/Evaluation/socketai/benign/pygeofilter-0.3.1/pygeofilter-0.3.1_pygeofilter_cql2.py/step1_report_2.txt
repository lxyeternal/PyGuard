{
  "purpose": "Defines mappings for various CQL2 operators and predicates to corresponding AST node classes, facilitating parsing and evaluation of CQL2 expressions.",
  "sources": "Imports modules, defines constants, and a function that inspects AST nodes to determine operator types.",
  "sinks": "The function get_op inspects AST nodes; no sinks for untrusted data, no system commands, or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input AST nodes are checked within get_op to determine operator type; no data flows to external systems or insecure functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs. The code appears to be standard for defining mappings and a helper function.",
  "analysis": "The code provides mappings from operator strings to AST node classes, supporting parsing logic for CQL2. The get_op function iterates through these mappings to identify the operator type of a given AST node. There are no input/output operations, no data leaks, or external calls. The code uses static dictionaries and a simple function without dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden behavior. Overall, it appears to be a standard configuration and utility code segment with no malicious or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, non-malicious configuration setup for a CQL2 parser, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected. It serves as a mapping utility with no evident security threats.",
