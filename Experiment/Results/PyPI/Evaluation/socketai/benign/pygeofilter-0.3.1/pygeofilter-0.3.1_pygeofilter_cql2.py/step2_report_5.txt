  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is described as static mappings and a simple function `get_op`. No suspicious behavior, external data handling, or obfuscation. The confidence is high (0.95), and the malware score is 0.\n- **Verdict:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's nature. No issues found.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing static mappings and a straightforward helper function. No external or malicious activity.\n- **Verdict:** The assessment is consistent; malware score remains 0.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Reiterates that the code is static configuration and type checking, with no malicious patterns.\n- **Verdict:** No concerns; malware score is 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern—static dictionaries, simple type checks, no external or malicious behavior.\n- **Verdict:** No issues; malware score is 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Continues the same reasoning—static setup, no external data or obfuscation, straightforward utility functions.\n- **Verdict:** No concerns; malware score is 0.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** All reports correctly identify that the code is purely static configuration with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or external data handling.\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning:** No errors or flawed reasoning are evident in any report.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- **Risk scores:** The security risk scores are low (mostly 0 or 0.1), which seems reasonable for static configuration code.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; all assessments correctly identify the code as safe.\n- **Consistency:** The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Final conclusion:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (reasonable, given the code's role as configuration; minimal security concern)\n\n### My own estimate:\nGiven the comprehensive analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is benign, static, and without malicious intent.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n\nThis code is safe, with no security risks beyond the minimal baseline, which is acceptable for configuration modules.",
