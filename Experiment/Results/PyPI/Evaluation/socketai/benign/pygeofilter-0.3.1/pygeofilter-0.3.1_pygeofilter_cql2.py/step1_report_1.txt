  "purpose": "Define mappings for CQL2 parser and evaluator nodes to their corresponding AST classes, facilitating query parsing and evaluation.",
  "sources": "Imports of standard typing and local ast module; use of constant dictionaries mapping string operators to AST node classes.",
  "sinks": "Function get_op reads node type to determine operator; no direct data sinks or untrusted data handling evident.",
  "flows": "get_op iterates over BINARY_OP_PREDICATES_MAP to identify node types, returning operator strings; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. The code performs standard mapping functions; no obfuscated code or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up static mappings between string operators and AST node classes for query parsing. The get_op function performs a type check to identify node type and returns a string operator if matched. The use of local modules and straightforward dictionary structures indicates typical application logic. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or data leakage mechanisms are present. The code appears to be a standard configuration module with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a configuration and utility for a CQL2 parser, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not process untrusted input beyond type checking and mapping, and there are no evident malicious patterns.",
