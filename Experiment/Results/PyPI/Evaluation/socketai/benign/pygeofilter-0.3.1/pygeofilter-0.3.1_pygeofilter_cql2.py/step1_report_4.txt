{
  "purpose": "Define mappings for various CQL2 parser nodes, including comparison, spatial, temporal, array predicates, and arithmetic operations, facilitating parsing and evaluation of CQL2 expressions.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; static mappings are defined within the code.",
  "sinks": "The get_op function potentially exposes node type checking, but does not directly lead to dangerous operations.",
  "flows": "The get_op function maps node types to operator strings, but does not process untrusted data directly.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code is primarily static mappings and a simple type check function.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes static dictionaries mapping string operators to AST node classes for comparison, spatial, temporal, array, arithmetic, and condition predicates. It uses standard Python typing and straightforward dictionary unpacking. The get_op function performs type checking against these mappings to return the operator string for a given AST node. There are no indications of malicious intent, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The code appears to serve as a configuration or utility module for a parser or evaluator, with no external data processing, network operations, or data leaks involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static configuration for CQL2 parsing, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It functions as a lookup and type-check utility, with no evident security risks.",
