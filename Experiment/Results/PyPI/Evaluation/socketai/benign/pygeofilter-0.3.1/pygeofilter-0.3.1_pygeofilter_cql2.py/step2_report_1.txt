  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code defines static mappings between string operators and AST node classes for CQL2 parsing, with a helper function `get_op` to identify operator strings from AST nodes.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward configuration.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0.1, Obfuscated: 0, Confidence: 0.95.\n- **Assessment:** The low risk score aligns with the code's benign nature. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the static nature of mappings and the simple `get_op` function.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, no external data handling, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Confidence: 1.\n- **Assessment:** The zero risk score is appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, static mappings and a type-checking function for operator identification.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Confidence: 1.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the benign nature.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Static dictionaries for various predicate mappings, with a `get_op` function.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, obfuscation, or external data processing.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0.1, Obfuscated: 0, Confidence: 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The low risk score is appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Similar static mappings and utility function.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Confidence: 1.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports describe code that is purely static configuration for a parser, with a simple helper function. There are no dynamic code executions, no network operations, no handling of untrusted data, and no obfuscation.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Security Risks:** The minimal risk scores reflect the benign nature of the code. The only slightly elevated risk score (0.1) in some reports likely accounts for the potential of misuse if misapplied, but given the static nature, this is reasonable.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a straightforward static configuration module.\n- No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The `get_op` function performs safe type checking without executing or evaluating untrusted input.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a benign configuration setup for a CQL2 parser with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
