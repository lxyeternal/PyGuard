  "purpose": "Defines static mappings between operator strings and AST node classes for CQL2 parsing, along with a helper function to identify operator strings from AST nodes.",
  "sources": "Static dictionaries mapping operator strings to AST node classes; the get_op function inspecting AST node types.",
  "sinks": "Type checks within get_op; no external data or untrusted input handling.",
  "flows": "get_op inspects node type and returns corresponding operator string if matched.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, or dynamic execution; straightforward static configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static configuration module mapping operator strings to AST node classes with a simple helper function for operator identification. It contains no external data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The get_op function performs safe type checks without evaluating untrusted input. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and static nature make it inherently safe. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static configuration for a CQL2 parser, with no malicious or security concerns. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and appropriate. No further action is necessary.",
