  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code defines static mappings for CQL2 operators and a simple `get_op` function to identify operator strings from AST nodes.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, no external data handling, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior. The code is purely configuration and utility.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (very low, just a slight caution for static code). This seems reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing static mappings and a helper function.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, no external input/output, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. No issues.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Static mappings and a simple type-checking function.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, no external data, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Confirmed as benign.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar static configuration and type checking.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (slightly cautious, but acceptable).\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Static mappings with a utility function.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, no external handling, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Confirmed as safe.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Critical Review:\n- **Code presence of issues:** All reports correctly identify that the code is purely static configuration and utility functions with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- **Scores justification:** The malware scores are all zero, which is appropriate given the benign nature. The security risk scores are very low, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:** No claims of vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; all reports correctly interpret the code as configuration.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious intent or code detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk score:** Given the nature of the code, a risk score of **0.1** (or 0) is appropriate. Slightly cautious but negligible.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.05 (very minimal, just a conservative default for static configuration code)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard static configuration for a parser, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk. The reports' assessments are consistent and reasonable.",
