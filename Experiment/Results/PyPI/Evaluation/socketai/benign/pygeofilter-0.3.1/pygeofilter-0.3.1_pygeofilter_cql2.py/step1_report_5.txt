  "purpose": "Defines mappings and utility functions for CQL2 parser and evaluator configurations, including operators and predicate types.",
  "sources": "Imports from typing and local ast module; dictionaries mapping strings to ast node classes.",
  "sinks": "Function get_op inspects nodes and returns operator strings; no data sinks for untrusted input or external communication.",
  "flows": "get_op function checks node types against predefined classes and returns corresponding operator string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious or obfuscated code patterns. The code is straightforward and uses static mappings.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up static dictionaries for operator and predicate mappings used in a parser. The get_op function performs type checks to determine the operator. No input/output handling, no file/network access, and no execution of untrusted data are present. No suspicious or malicious patterns detected. The code appears to be a standard configuration for a parser with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration module for CQL2 parsing and evaluation. It does not contain malware, obfuscated code, or security vulnerabilities. It only defines static mappings and a utility function for type checking, with no external data handling or malicious behavior.",
