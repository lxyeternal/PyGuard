  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the original code, and evaluate the reasoning, scores, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard configuration module mapping operators to AST nodes, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- The report correctly identifies that the code is static, with mappings and a simple helper function.\n- The low security risk score (0.1) is reasonable, given that the code doesn't process untrusted data or perform external operations.\n- The malware score of 0 aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The reasoning is sound, and the conclusion is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the static nature and absence of malicious code.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- The report's conclusion that the code is benign and standard is accurate.\n- The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n- The security risk score of 0 is justified.\n- The reasoning is thorough and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward mapping with no malicious intent.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- Correctly identifies that the code is purely configuration with no external or malicious operations.\n- The malware and security risk scores are appropriate.\n- The analysis is detailed and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Static mappings and a simple type check function, no malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- The reasoning is consistent; the code is benign.\n- The slightly lower confidence score (0.9) is acceptable but still indicates high certainty.\n- The malware score remains 0, which is correct.\n- The security risk score of 0.1 is reasonable, considering the code's static nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines mappings and utility functions with no malicious intent.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- The analysis is accurate; no external or malicious operations are present.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as there is no malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate; the code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 vs. 0), but all are low, reflecting the benign static configuration nature.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a static configuration module mapping operator strings to AST node classes.\n- The get_op function performs simple type checks without executing or evaluating untrusted input.\n- No external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution is involved.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (appropriate, given minimal potential for misuse, but generally low)\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the consensus that the code is a benign, static configuration module with no security concerns.",
