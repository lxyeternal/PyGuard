  "purpose": "Define mappings for CQL2 parser and evaluator components, associating string operators with AST node classes.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; the code consists of static definitions and a helper function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data, as the code does not process external input or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the get_op function inspects node types but does not execute untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. The code is purely configuration and type mapping.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several dictionaries mapping string operators to AST node classes for comparison, spatial, temporal, array, arithmetic, and logical operations. It also provides a helper function get_op to identify the operator string corresponding to a node's type. All definitions are static, with no dynamic execution or external data handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The purpose appears to be establishing operator mappings for a CQL2 parser.\n\nNo code injection, data leakage, or unsafe practices are evident. The function get_op performs a straightforward isinstance check and returns a string if matched, which is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration module establishing operator mappings and includes a simple helper function. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a benign part of a larger parser/evaluator system.",
