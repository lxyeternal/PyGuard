{
  "purpose": "Define data structures for geospatial and temporal objects used in the pygeofilter project, including Geometry, Envelope, and Interval classes, with associated properties and methods.",
  "sources": "The code reads import statements from standard libraries (dataclasses, datetime, typing) and a third-party library (pygeoif). It does not accept external input or user data.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or output, such as network transmission, file writing, or command execution.",
  "flows": "The code mainly constructs in-memory data structures without processing external untrusted data, thus no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is apparent.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code strictly defines data models and properties without dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or other unusual behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes data classes for geospatial geometries and temporal intervals, with methods for comparison and interface representation. It imports only standard and third-party libraries without executing external code or handling untrusted input. No malicious or suspicious constructs are present. The use of shape() from pygeoif is standard for geometric shape processing. No obfuscation or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured implementation of data models for geospatial and temporal data. There are no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated code. It is safe and primarily serves as a data container and interface definition for the pygeofilter project.",
