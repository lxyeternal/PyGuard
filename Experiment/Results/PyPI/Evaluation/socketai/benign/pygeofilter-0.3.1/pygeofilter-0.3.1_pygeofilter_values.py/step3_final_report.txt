{
  "purpose": "Defines data classes for geospatial and temporal data, including Geometry, Envelope, and Interval, for use in geospatial applications.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code constructs in-memory objects and uses the 'shape' function from 'pygeoif' for geometry comparison.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted input or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "Data is created via class instantiation; no data flows from external sources to sinks; comparison uses 'shape()' internally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data classes for geospatial and temporal data with properties for GeoJSON-like structures and comparison methods. It uses standard libraries and trusted third-party 'pygeoif'. There are no external data inputs, no network or file I/O, and no dynamic code execution. The code serves purely as data modeling, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The use of 'shape()' from 'pygeoif' is standard for geometry operations. Overall, the code is benign, straightforward, and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of data classes for geospatial and temporal data, with no security concerns or malicious intent. The current scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, and risk: 0 are justified and accurate.",
