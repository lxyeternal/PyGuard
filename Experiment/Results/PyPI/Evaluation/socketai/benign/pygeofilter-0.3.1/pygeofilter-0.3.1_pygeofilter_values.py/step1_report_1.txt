{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures for geospatial and temporal data representations, including Geometry, Envelope, and Interval, with utility properties and methods.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (dataclasses, datetime, typing) and external library 'pygeoif'.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted input directly; no network, file, or sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; data structures are mainly for in-memory representation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data classes and type annotations for geospatial and temporal data. It uses external 'shape' function from 'pygeoif' for geometry comparisons. There are no functions or methods that process external inputs or perform operations that could lead to data leaks or security issues. All imports are from trusted standard and external libraries. No code injection, network activity, or sensitive data handling is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward data model setup for geospatial and temporal objects with no malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or external communications. Overall, the code is safe and does not pose a security threat.",
