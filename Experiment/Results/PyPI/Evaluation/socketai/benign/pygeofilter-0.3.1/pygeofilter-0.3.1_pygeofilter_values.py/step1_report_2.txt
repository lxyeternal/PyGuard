{
  "purpose": "Define data structures and types for geospatial and temporal data handling in a Python project related to geospatial filtering.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (dataclasses, datetime, typing), and from third-party library pygeoif.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or untrusted data handling observed; no user input, network, or file I/O is present.",
  "flows": "Data structures are used for internal representation and comparison, with no external data flows or command execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns detected. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical data class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines dataclasses for geometric shapes and temporal intervals, with properties to generate GeoJSON-like structures and equality checks using the shape() function from a third-party library. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or insecure data handling is present. The import of the pygeoif library is standard and does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation of data structures for geospatial and temporal data. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is well-structured and straightforward.",
