{
  "purpose": "Define an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) structure for representing and processing CQL queries, including various condition, predicate, and expression nodes.",
  "sources": "Import statements (dataclasses, enum, typing, local module values); class initializers and methods accessing input data via parameters and attributes.",
  "sinks": "String formatting methods (get_template), potentially vulnerable if format strings are influenced by untrusted input; no explicit data sinks like network, file, or system commands present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (e.g., attribute names, attribute values, patterns) through node attributes into template strings for rendering; no dynamic execution or external data flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code relies entirely on data structures and formatting; no dynamic code execution or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured representation of AST nodes for query parsing, with clear separation of node types and usage of standard Python features. It uses string templates for rendering representations, which could be manipulated if input data were malicious, but the data sources are mostly parameters passed into class constructors. No external data sources, network access, or system calls are evident. The functions and class methods serve to structure, compare, and format nodes, with no indications of malicious intent. Overall, the code appears safe and legitimate, primarily serving as a query AST framework.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a clean, well-organized AST class hierarchy for query representation with no malicious behavior detected. It does not perform any network, file, or system operations, nor does it contain obfuscated or suspicious code patterns. The security risk is negligible.",
