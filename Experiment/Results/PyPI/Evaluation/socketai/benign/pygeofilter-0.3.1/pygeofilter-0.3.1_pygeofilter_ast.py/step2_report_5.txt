  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the details of the code, potential security issues, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Defines an AST for representing query expressions, predicates, spatial, temporal, and logical conditions.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No external data sources or sinks; purely structural.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious or malicious patterns; code is standard.\n- **Analysis:** Well-structured, purely data modeling, no dynamic execution.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior; negligible security risk.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies that the code is purely structural, with no malicious behavior. The low risk score is appropriate. The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose:** Defines an AST for CQL expressions, including various nodes.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No external data or command execution.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; standard class definitions.\n- **Analysis:** No dynamic code execution, unsafe operations, or malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard AST representation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning aligns with the code's nature. The risk and malware scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose:** AST for spatial, temporal, comparison, and logical conditions.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** String templates and 'get_repr' for debug; no execution.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code; only data modeling.\n- **Analysis:** Purely declarative, no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent or malware.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe risk score of 0.2 might be slightly conservative but acceptable. The malware score of 0 is correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose:** AST for query language, with various predicates and expressions.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** String templates for representation; no execution.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; standard code.\n- **Analysis:** No dynamic code execution or unsafe operations.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAppropriate scores; the code is purely structural with no malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose:** AST for query representation, including predicates and logical constructs.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** String templates, no code execution.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious or malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis:** Standard data modeling, no unsafe behaviors.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nScores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification and Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious behavior, code injection, or suspicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code clarity.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2). Given the code is purely structural and does not execute untrusted data or commands, these are reasonable. However, the scores could be uniformly set to 0, considering the negligible risk.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation patterns)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk in the code itself)\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The scores reflect the code's nature well. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n**Malware score: 0**  \n**Obfuscated score: 0**  \n**Risk score: 0**  \n\nThis code is a well-structured, safe AST modeling library with no malicious or security concerns.",
