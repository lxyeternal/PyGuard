  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the key points: presence of malicious code, obfuscation, potential vulnerabilities, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Defines an AST for query expressions, no external data or user input.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation. The code is purely structural.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1 — appropriate given the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is accurate; negligible security risk.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct scoring, no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar AST definitions for CQL, no external data sources.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious code, no dynamic execution, no obfuscation. The code is for data modeling.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0 — aligns well.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected; scores are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct, no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose:** AST for spatial, temporal, and geospatial queries.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior; no dynamic code execution or external data handling.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2 — slightly higher but still low.\n- **Note:** The risk score is marginally higher, possibly due to the string templates that could be misused if incorporated insecurely elsewhere. However, within this code, it's safe.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct; the slightly higher risk score reflects potential if misused downstream but is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose:** AST for query language, with string templates.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior; no dynamic execution or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate assessment.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose:** AST for query representation.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious code, no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1 — suitable.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of all reports:\n\n- **Malware score:** All are 0, consistent with the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** All are 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Mostly very low (0.1 or 0.2), reflecting the structural nature of the code and lack of active data processing or external interactions.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- The code in all reports is a clean, well-structured AST framework for query representation.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.\n- The slight variation in risk scores (0.1 or 0.2) is reasonable, considering the potential misuse of string templates if misapplied downstream, but within this code, it's negligible.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — very low, only considering potential downstream misuse of string templates.\n\n**Overall, the code appears safe and well-structured.**",
