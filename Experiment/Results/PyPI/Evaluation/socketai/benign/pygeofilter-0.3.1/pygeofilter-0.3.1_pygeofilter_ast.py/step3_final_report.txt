{
  "purpose": "Defines an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) structure for representing complex query expressions, predicates, spatial, temporal, and logical conditions in a query language. It serves as a data model without executing or processing external untrusted data.",
  "sources": "Class constructors and data attributes that initialize AST nodes; no external input or data reading operations present.",
  "sinks": "String templates used in get_template methods for rendering query expressions; no data sinks or external outputs involved.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is purely structural with no dynamic data processing or execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and primarily declarative.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions modeling various query components, including logical, comparison, spatial, temporal, and array predicates. It uses standard Python features such as data classes and enums. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or file handling are present. String templates are used solely for formatting representations and do not execute code. The overall structure is transparent and designed for query AST representation. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured AST data model for query representation, with no malicious behavior or security risks. The low scores assigned in existing reports are appropriate, and the overall security posture is negligible. The code can be confidently used in its intended context.",
