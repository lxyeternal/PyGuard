{
  "purpose": "This code defines an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) structure for parsing and representing Common Query Language (CQL) expressions, including various condition, predicate, spatial, temporal, and expression nodes, along with utility functions for representation and indentation.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'dataclasses', 'enum', 'typing', and local module '.values'. No external input sources or data reading functions are present.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks, network communication, or command execution points are present. No unsafe or dynamic code execution mechanisms detected.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows indicating potential malicious data processing or transfer. The code is purely structural and definitional.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only class and function definitions for AST construction; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. No obfuscated or dynamic code execution, no suspicious string manipulations, or risky patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a comprehensive set of class definitions for modeling a CQL AST, including various condition, predicate, and expression nodes. It uses standard Python features such as dataclasses, enums, and type annotations, with no dynamic execution or unsafe operations. The utility functions for representation are benign and purely for debugging or logging. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or external interactions. The structure is consistent with a parser or AST generator and does not include any code that could be exploited or used maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-structured AST representation for CQL expressions, with no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger library for query parsing or evaluation, without any harmful or sabotage code present.",
