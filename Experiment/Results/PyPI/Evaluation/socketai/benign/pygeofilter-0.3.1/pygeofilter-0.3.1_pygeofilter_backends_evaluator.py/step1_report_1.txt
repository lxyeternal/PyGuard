{
  "purpose": "This code defines utility functions, decorators, and a base class for evaluating abstract syntax trees (AST) nodes, primarily for use in a larger project related to geospatial filtering.",
  "sources": "The code reads class types, functions, and class attributes, especially during decorator execution and class initialization.",
  "sinks": "No direct sink points exist; however, the evaluate method calls handler functions which may process AST nodes, but no untrusted data processing or external system interaction occurs here.",
  "flows": "Class definitions and decorator functions establish a handler map. The evaluate method recursively processes AST nodes, calling associated handlers. No external data flow or untrusted input handling is explicitly present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code relies on standard Python features for class handling, decorators, and recursion.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for class hierarchy traversal, a decorator to associate handler functions with specific node types, and a metaclass to build a handler map. The Evaluator class uses this map to evaluate AST nodes recursively, invoking the correct handler or raising an error if none exists. All operations are standard, well-structured, and do not include malicious or suspicious behavior. No external system interactions, data leaks, or code injections are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a class-based AST evaluation framework with no signs of malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger safe project focused on AST processing.",
