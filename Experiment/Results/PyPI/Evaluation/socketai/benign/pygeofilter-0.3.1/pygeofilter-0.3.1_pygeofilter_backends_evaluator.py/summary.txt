  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe AST evaluation framework with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The main security consideration is the potential execution of malicious code via external handlers, but this risk is external to the code itself. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score can be conservatively set around 0.1 to account for external handler trust boundaries."
