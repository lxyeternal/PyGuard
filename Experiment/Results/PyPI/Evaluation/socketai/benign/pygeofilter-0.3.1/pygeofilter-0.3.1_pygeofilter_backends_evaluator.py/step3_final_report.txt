{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions, decorators, and a metaclass for registering and dispatching AST node handlers within an evaluation framework. It facilitates recursive AST evaluation by mapping node types to handler functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads class definitions, method decorators, and AST node objects during evaluation, particularly when retrieving sub-nodes via 'get_sub_nodes'.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data leaks are present; handler functions are invoked with nodes and sub-arguments, but no external data is processed or transmitted within this code.",
  "flows": "Source: AST nodes and class definitions; Flow: 'evaluate' method calls registered handlers with nodes and their sub-nodes; no external data flow or system interaction occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors are detected. The code uses standard Python features and patterns for AST handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for class hierarchy traversal, a decorator for registering handler functions, and a metaclass that builds a handler map at class creation. The 'Evaluator' class uses this map to recursively evaluate AST nodes, dispatching to appropriate handlers or raising errors if none are registered. The implementation is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. External handlers could be malicious if supplied from untrusted sources, but this is outside the scope of this code. The code is well-structured and adheres to standard patterns for AST evaluation frameworks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe AST evaluation framework with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The main security consideration is the potential execution of malicious code via external handlers, but this risk is external to the code itself. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score can be conservatively set around 0.1 to account for external handler trust boundaries.",
