{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions, decorators, and a class hierarchy for evaluating abstract syntax trees (AST) in a safe, extensible manner. It is part of a larger project for geospatial filtering.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (functools, typing), and a relative import of 'ast' from the parent module.",
  "sinks": "The evaluate() method calls handlers for AST nodes, but these handlers are dynamically registered and external to this code, so no specific sink code is present here.",
  "flows": "Data flows from AST nodes through the evaluate() method, which calls registered handlers, and potentially through the adopt() fallback method if no handler exists.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code uses standard patterns for AST evaluation, dynamic handler registration, and class introspection. No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or data leaks are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions to find subclasses, a decorator to register handler functions for specific AST node types, and a metaclass to create a handler map. The Evaluator class uses this map to evaluate AST nodes recursively, calling appropriate handlers or falling back to an unimplemented error. All parts of the code follow typical design patterns for AST processing and do not contain malicious or suspicious code. No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or suspicious behavior are present. The logic relies on external handler functions, which could potentially be malicious if provided from untrusted sources, but this code itself does not include or execute such code.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, well-structured framework for AST evaluation within a larger project. It does not contain any malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or security risks. It is safe to use as part of the project, assuming external handlers are also trusted.",
