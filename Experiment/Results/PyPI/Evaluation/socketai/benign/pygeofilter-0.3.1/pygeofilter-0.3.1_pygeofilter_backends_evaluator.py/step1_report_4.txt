{
  "purpose": "This code defines utility functions, decorators, and a class structure for evaluating an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) within a larger project, likely for parsing or processing code or queries.",
  "sources": "The code reads class definitions, method decorators, and class attributes. No external input sources or untrusted data input points are present.",
  "sinks": "The code calls handler functions stored in a class attribute, and the evaluate method may invoke user-defined handlers. No direct data leak or external network communication occurs.",
  "flows": "No external data flows from untrusted sources to sinks. The evaluate method dispatches to handlers which could be user-defined, but the provided code does not specify any malicious behaviors or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual code constructs. The structure is typical for an AST evaluation framework.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for class introspection, a decorator to register handler methods, and a metaclass to build a handler map for evaluating AST nodes. The Evaluator class uses this map to dispatch evaluation calls to appropriate handlers. There are no external inputs, network calls, or malicious payloads detected. The code relies on user-defined handlers, which could potentially be malicious if defined elsewhere, but within this snippet, no malicious intent or behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be a standard implementation of an AST evaluation framework with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is safe within the context of this isolated code fragment.",
