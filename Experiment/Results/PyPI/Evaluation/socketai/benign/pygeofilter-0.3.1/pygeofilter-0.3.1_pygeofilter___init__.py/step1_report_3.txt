  "purpose": "The code provides licensing information and imports a version variable for the pygeofilter project, setting the __all__ attribute.",
  "sources": "Importing __version__ from a local module (.version)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks present",
  "flows": "Import of __version__ from local module; setting __all__ to expose __version__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behavior observed. Only licensing comments and straightforward import and attribute setting.",
  "analysis": "The code contains standard licensing comments and imports a version variable from a relative module. The __all__ list exposes __version__, which is a typical pattern in Python modules. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious operations detected.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be a benign, standard module file containing license info, a version import, and __all__ declaration. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
