{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a package initialization file that imports a version string from a local module and exposes it via __all__, primarily for version management and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .version module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data flow or external interactions present",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow or untrusted data handling",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard package setup code with licensing comments and straightforward import/export",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard __init__.py file for a Python package, importing __version__ from a local module and exposing it. It contains only licensing comments, import statements, and __all__ declaration. No user input, network activity, data processing, or malicious constructs are present. The code structure is typical and benign, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident or inferred. The code's simplicity and clarity support a high confidence in its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initialization snippet with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments and scores provided are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
