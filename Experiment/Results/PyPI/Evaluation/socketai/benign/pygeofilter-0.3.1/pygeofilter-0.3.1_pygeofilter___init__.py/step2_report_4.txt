  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior:**\n   - The code is a typical `__init__.py` file for a Python package, primarily importing a version string from a local module (`.version`) and exposing it via `__all__`.\n   - It contains only licensing comments, standard import statements, and module metadata setup.\n   - There are no user inputs, network calls, data processing, or any dynamic code execution.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - The code structure and logic are straightforward and standard for package initialization.\n\n2. **Assessment of Security Risks:**\n   - Given the code's simplicity and standard pattern, there are no signs of malicious activity.\n   - The import of `__version__` from a local module is typical for version management.\n   - The comments and license do not indicate any malicious intent.\n   - No data flows from untrusted sources, and no external interactions are involved.\n\n3. **Evaluation of Reports:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign, with no anomalies, obfuscation, malware, or security risks.\n   - The confidence levels are high (1), and all scores for obfuscated, malware, and security risk are 0.\n   - The analysis in each report correctly identifies the code as standard and safe.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Obfuscated:** 0 — No obfuscation detected.\n   - **Malware:** 0 — No malicious behavior or code.\n   - **Risk:** 0 — No security risk, given the code's benign nature.\n   - **Malware Score Justification:** Since there's no suspicious or malicious code, the malware score remains 0.\n   - **Security Risk Justification:** The code does not perform any operations that could pose security risks.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports assume the imported `.version` module is safe, which is reasonable given the context.\n   - No suspicious behavior is inferred from the code structure or comments.\n\n6. **Final Recommendations:**\n   - The overall assessment aligns with the reports: the code is safe and benign.\n   - No changes to scores are necessary.\n   - The code does not warrant any security alerts or further investigation.\n\n**Final Summary:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis code snippet is a standard, harmless module initialization pattern with no security concerns.",
