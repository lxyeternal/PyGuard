  "purpose": "This code is part of a Python project for geospatial filtering, specifically defining module metadata and version information.",
  "sources": "Imports __version__ from a local module file (.version).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Imports version information from a local source and exposes it via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The code appears standard for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version string from a relative module and sets __all__ to expose __version__. It contains only standard package metadata code, with no user input, network operations, or data handling that could lead to security issues. No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated or malicious code, and no suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python package module initialization with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
