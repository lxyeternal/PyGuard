  "purpose": "The code defines the version information for the pygeofilter project and sets the module's exported attributes.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module '.version' to retrieve __version__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The import source provides version info, and __all__ exposes __version__; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version string from a local module and exposes it via __all__. It contains no user input handling, network activity, or other suspicious behaviors. The import is relative, which is typical for package internals. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module definition snippet for managing version info. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
