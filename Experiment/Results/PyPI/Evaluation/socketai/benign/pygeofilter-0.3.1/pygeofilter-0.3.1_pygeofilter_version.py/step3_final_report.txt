  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to the __version__ variable, indicating the package version.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data sources; it only assigns a string to a variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code is a simple assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard version declaration with no input/output, data processing, or external dependencies. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and clarity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version string assignment with no security concerns or malicious behavior. All reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
