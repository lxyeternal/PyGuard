  "review": "Let's carefully evaluate each report and the associated code snippets.\n\n1. Confirm if issues are present:\n   - All reports describe the same minimal code: assigning a version string to __version__.\n   - The code is straightforward and typical for Python packages.\n   - No input/output, data processing, or suspicious constructs are present.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected.\n\n2. Review logical reasoning and conclusions:\n   - All reports correctly identify the code as benign, standard, and harmless.\n   - The analyses are consistent and reasonable.\n\n3. Score evaluations:\n   - Malware score: all reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - Obfuscated score: all assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n   - Security risk: all assign 0, correctly indicating no security concern.\n\n4. Justification for risk scores:\n   - Since the code is purely a version string assignment with no external dependencies, inputs, or outputs, a risk score higher than 0.0 is unwarranted.\n   - The reports' scores seem reasonable and consistent.\n\n5. Potential issues:\n   - No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious intent are evident.\n   - No assumptions are made beyond what the code shows.\n\n6. Final assessment:\n   - The code is a standard version declaration.\n   - No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n\n**Summary:**\n- All reports are accurate in their assessments.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent.\n- No modifications needed.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis provided.",
