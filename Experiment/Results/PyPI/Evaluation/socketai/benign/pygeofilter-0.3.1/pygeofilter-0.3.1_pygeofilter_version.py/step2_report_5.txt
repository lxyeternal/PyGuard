  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports confirm that the code is simply assigning a version string to `__version__`. There are no functions, external data reads, or suspicious constructs. The code is straightforward and standard.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is minimal, benign, and typical for version declaration. No errors or logical flaws are evident in the summaries.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, which is correct as the code is clear and unobfuscated.\n- Confidence scores are 1, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n\nThese scores seem reasonable and consistent across reports.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nSince the code is just a straightforward version assignment with no external data, no functions, and no suspicious patterns, a risk score higher than 0.0 is unwarranted. The code poses no security threat.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \nThe malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate. No malicious activity is suggested or implied.\n\n6. **Challenging Assumptions**  \nAll reports assume the code is benign based on its simplicity. This is justified; there's no evidence to suggest malicious intent.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nScores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct, no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct, code is clear)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct, no security risk)\n\n### Additional Comments:\nGiven the simplicity and standard practice of version assignment, the overall security risk is negligible. No further action or concern is warranted.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, benign version string assignment with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
