  "review": "Let's systematically analyze the provided reports and the original code.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   The original code is a straightforward version declaration:\n   ```python\n   VERSION = (2, 0, 0)\n   __version__ = '.'.join(map(str, VERSION))\n   ```\n   All reports agree that this is a standard, static assignment with no dynamic behavior, no external input, and no suspicious patterns. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or data leaks.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly identify that this code is benign, with no anomalies or suspicious activity. No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident in the summaries.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n   - `obfuscated`: 0\n   - `malware`: 0\n   - `securityRisk`: 0\n\n   These scores seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since all reports indicate no malicious activity or security risks, raising the risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified. The code is a typical version declaration, a common pattern in open source projects.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's harmless nature. No malicious intent or behavior is detected or suggested.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports do not rely on assumptions; they accurately describe the code's behavior as static and benign.\n\n7. **Score Consistency and Final Assessment**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk Score**: **0** (no security risk)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThis code is a standard version assignment pattern, common in Python projects, with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores reflect this assessment accurately.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**:  \nAll evidence points to a benign, non-malicious version declaration. No further action or concern is warranted.",
