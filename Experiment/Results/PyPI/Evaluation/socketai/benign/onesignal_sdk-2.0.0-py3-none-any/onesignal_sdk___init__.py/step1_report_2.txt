  "purpose": "Define the version of the module or package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the constant tuple 'VERSION' to generate a version string.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or send data to external sources or systems.",
  "flows": "The 'VERSION' tuple is mapped to strings and joined to form '__version__'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; simple version assignment and string join.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a tuple 'VERSION' with version numbers, then creates a string '__version__' by joining the elements of 'VERSION' with periods. This is a standard practice for defining a version string. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling. The code is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely defines a version string and contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
