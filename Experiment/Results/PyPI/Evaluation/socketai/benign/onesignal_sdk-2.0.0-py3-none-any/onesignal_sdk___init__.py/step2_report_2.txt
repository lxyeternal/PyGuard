  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully and compare them to the original code.\n\n**Original Code:**\n```python\nVERSION = (2, 0, 0)\n__version__ = '.'.join(map(str, VERSION))\n```\n\n**Assessment of the Reports:**\n\n1. **Presence of Issues:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code simply defines a version tuple and constructs a version string.\n   - There are no external inputs, data leaks, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation.\n   - The code is straightforward and standard for version declaration.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they do not overlook any suspicious behavior.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports suggest any malicious activity or security risk.\n   - The code is static, non-executable beyond simple string joining, and does not handle external data.\n   - Therefore, risk scores should remain at 0 for all.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's benign purpose.\n   - No malicious behavior is implied or observed.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n   - They focus on factual analysis.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n\n**Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- The code is a standard version declaration, common in Python modules.\n- There are no security issues, obfuscation, or malware.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Estimated scores based on this review:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- The code is simple, static, and standard.\n- No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n- The reports are accurate and align with the code's nature.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThis code snippet is benign and safe. The current scoring reflects that accurately.",
