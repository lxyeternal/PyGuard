  "purpose": "Define the package version string from a static tuple",
  "sources": "No external inputs; static tuple VERSION",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "Assignment of VERSION to __version__ via string join",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static code with no obfuscation or dynamic behavior",
  "analysis": "The code declares a static version tuple and constructs a version string from it. There are no external data sources, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation, and no suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify this as benign, standard version declaration code. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the code's simplicity and safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static version declaration with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
