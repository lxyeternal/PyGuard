  "purpose": "Define URL endpoint paths for interacting with the OneSignal API, likely used for managing notifications, devices, segments, and apps.",
  "sources": "Constant string assignments defining API endpoints, which do not read external input.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or processing occurs in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines static URL path strings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected. No credentials, secrets, or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string definitions for API endpoint URLs. No input handling, no data processing, and no dynamic code execution are present. It appears to serve as configuration or constants for API interaction. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or hidden code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a static configuration for API endpoints without any malicious intent or security risks.",
