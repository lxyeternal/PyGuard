  "purpose": "Define API endpoint URL paths for interacting with the OneSignal API service",
  "sources": "Constant string assignments defining API URL paths",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling, user input, or data processing present",
  "flows": "No data flow or data processing observed; only static URL path definitions",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets beyond URLs, no obfuscated code, no dynamic execution or hidden behavior",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of static string variables defining API endpoints. There are no functions, input handling, or data processing. The URL paths appear standard for an API client setup. No signs of malicious activity, no suspicious behavior, no data leaks, and no hardcoded credentials or backdoors. The code is straightforward and non-obfuscated.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a basic configuration of API endpoints with no malicious or suspicious content. It poses no security risks or malware concerns.",
