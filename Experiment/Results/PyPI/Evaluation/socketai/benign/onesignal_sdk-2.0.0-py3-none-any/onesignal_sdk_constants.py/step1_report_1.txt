  "purpose": "Defines API endpoint URL paths for interacting with the OneSignal API for notifications, devices, segments, apps, and related operations.",
  "sources": "Constant string assignments representing URL paths; no input data handling present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as data output, network calls, or data manipulation are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks occurs; the code only declares constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets (besides public URLs), or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string constants defining API endpoints. There are no input handling, data processing, network calls, or dynamic behaviors. It appears to be configuration data for API interaction, with no malicious intent or suspicious activity present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of constant definitions for API paths, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears to be legitimate configuration data.",
