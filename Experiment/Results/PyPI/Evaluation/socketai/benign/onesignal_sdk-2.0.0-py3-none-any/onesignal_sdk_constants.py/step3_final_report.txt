  "sources": "Static string constants defining API URLs and paths.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of static strings with no dynamic or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely static configuration data with no input handling, network calls, or dynamic behaviors. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, assigning scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and static nature justify these scores. No suspicious patterns or malicious indicators are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of API endpoint path constants with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
