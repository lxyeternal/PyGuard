  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\nAll reports confirm that the code consists solely of static string constants defining API endpoint URLs for the OneSignal API. There are no functions, input handling, data processing, network calls, or dynamic behaviors present. This indicates that the code is purely configuration data.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:\n- No hardcoded secrets, API keys, or credentials are present.\n- No obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or unusual constructs are detected.\n- No signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malware activity.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning**:\n- **Obfuscated Score (0)**: Correct, as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Malware Score (0)**: Correct, since there are no malicious behaviors or indicators.\n- **Security Risk Score (0)**: Appropriate, given the absence of vulnerabilities, secrets, or risky code.\n\n4. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\nAll reports rightly avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they only describe the static constants and conclude no malicious or suspicious activity.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores**:\nThe scores are consistent across all reports, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n6. **Potential Risks and Concerns**:\nGiven the code's static nature, the only potential concern could be if these endpoints are used maliciously elsewhere. However, as per the code snippet alone, there is no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk Score**: **0** (no security risk)\n\n**Rationale**:\nThe code is purely configuration data—defining API paths. It does not handle input, perform network operations, or contain any malicious or suspicious logic. Therefore, the scores assigned are appropriate and should remain as such.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores are justified and should not be adjusted upward.",
