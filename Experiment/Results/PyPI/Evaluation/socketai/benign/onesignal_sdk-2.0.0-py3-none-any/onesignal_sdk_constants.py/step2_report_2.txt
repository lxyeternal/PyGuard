  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of static string constants defining API endpoint URLs.\n   - There are no input handling, data processing, network calls, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - They correctly conclude that the code is benign configuration data.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - confidence: 1\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - malware: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the static, harmless nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports indicate no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues, the risk scores are correctly set to 0.\n   - No need to adjust scores upward.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code only defines API URL paths.\n   - No malicious behaviors, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code, are present.\n   - Malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions.\n   - They focus on the static nature of the code and its lack of suspicious activity.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable scores are observed.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a straightforward set of constant definitions for API endpoints, serving as configuration data. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
