  "purpose": "Define URL endpoints for interacting with the OneSignal API",
  "sources": "Constant string assignments for API URL paths",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output operations are present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; purely static URL path definitions",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of string assignments for API endpoint paths, which are static and predefined. There are no input operations, no data processing, and no dynamic code execution. This pattern is typical for configuration or endpoint definitions. No signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward declaration of API URL paths used for interfacing with the OneSignal service. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is safe and purely structural.",
