  "purpose": "Defines API endpoint paths for interacting with the OneSignal API related to notifications, devices, segments, apps, and other resources.",
  "sources": "Constant string assignments representing API URL paths",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data processing, input/output, or data transmission code present",
  "flows": "No data flow or processing logic; only static URL path definitions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of static string assignments for various API endpoints. There are no input sources, data handling, or network operations included. This code appears to be a configuration or constant definitions module. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The absence of dynamic code, input handling, or data transmission indicates low risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of constant URL path definitions for an API client. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security concerns. It serves as configuration data only.",
