{
  "purpose": "The code defines a client library for interacting with the OneSignal API, including synchronous and asynchronous classes for sending notifications, managing devices, segments, apps, and retrieving data.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function parameters such as notification_body, query dictionaries, device IDs, notification IDs, segment IDs, app IDs, and bodies for creating or updating resources.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could potentially be sent in HTTP request payloads or query parameters, such as notification bodies, device info, segment data, or app configurations, which are then transmitted over the network.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user-provided parameters into request construction methods, which generate request configurations used in HTTP requests to external APIs. These flows are standard for API client libraries.",
  "anomalies": "The code predominantly performs standard API request preparation and does not contain any hardcoded secrets, suspicious dynamic code execution, or unusual code constructs. There are no evident backdoors, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors. All data handling appears to be straightforward, with parameters used directly for API calls.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically builds request configurations based on input parameters and class attributes, separating synchronous and asynchronous request handling. There is consistent use of parameter validation and method encapsulation for API endpoints. No signs of malicious payloads, hidden data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The structure follows typical API client design patterns. No suspicious code features, hardcoded credentials, or unsafe data handling are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard API client implementation for the OneSignal service, designed for managing notifications and related resources. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or supply chain sabotage. The code appears safe and legitimate.",
