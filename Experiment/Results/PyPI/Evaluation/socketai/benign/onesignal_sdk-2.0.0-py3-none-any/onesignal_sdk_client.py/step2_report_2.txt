  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report concludes that the code is a straightforward API client with no malicious intent, malware, or obfuscation. It correctly notes that the code constructs request parameters and payloads from inputs and sends them via external request functions.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Given the lack of malicious features, the risk score seems slightly high but still low; perhaps 0.1 would be more appropriate.\n- **Justification for higher score:** Since no malicious activity is detected, a risk score of 0.2 may be slightly overestimating. I would suggest lowering it to 0.1 for consistency.\n- **Overall:** The report's reasoning is sound; no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it describes the code as a standard API client with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. This aligns well with the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues here.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the report finds no malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behavior, emphasizing the code's straightforward API wrapper nature.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.0. This is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No concerns.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous analyses, no signs of malicious activity, code obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. This seems reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** The report confirms the code's legitimacy as an API client, with no malicious features or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.0. Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard, legitimate API client with no malicious or obfuscated code.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis.\n- The only minor point is that the risk scores in some reports (like 0.2) could be slightly lowered to 0.1, aligning with the overall low-risk assessment.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** Given the nature of the code (API wrapper, no secrets embedded, no malicious behavior), I would set this at **0.0 to 0.1**.\n\n**Therefore, my overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect the minimal inherent risk of API request handling, but no actual threat)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, legitimate, and poses no supply chain or malicious risk.",
