  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** The code acts as a wrapper for API requests, constructing request parameters from method inputs and passing them to external request functions.\n- **Potential Risks:** Data from inputs could be sent over the network; no internal data leaks or code injection observed.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. The code is straightforward, with clear data flow.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The report correctly assesses low risk (0.2), malware score 0, obfuscated 0, high confidence (0.9). The overall logic is sound.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Similar to Report 1, standard API client structure, with data flowing into request functions.\n- **Potential Risks:** Same as above; untrusted data could be transmitted, but no malicious activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code or secrets. The code performs expected API interactions.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly assigns low risk (0.1), malware 0, obfuscated 0, confidence 0.9.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Same pattern—API wrapper with request functions.\n- **Potential Risks:** Data sent via network; no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Low risk (0), malware 0, obfuscated 0, confidence 0.9.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Consistent with previous; request parameters built from inputs.\n- **Potential Risks:** Data flows into network requests; no malicious activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of obfuscation or malicious code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Low risk (0.1), malware 0, obfuscated 0, confidence 0.9.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Same as others; request construction from parameters.\n- **Potential Risks:** Data transmitted over network; no malicious intent observed.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Low risk (0), malware 0, obfuscated 0, confidence 0.9.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code Behavior:** All reports agree that this is a standard API client wrapper for OneSignal, constructing request parameters from inputs and sending them via external request functions.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors across all reports.\n- **Security Risks:** The overall risk is very low; the code handles data as expected for an API client.\n- **Potential Concerns:** The only potential concern is that untrusted data could be sent externally, but this is inherent in API clients and not indicative of malicious intent.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** Given the low risk, no malicious intent, and standard API client pattern, a risk score of around **0.1** is appropriate, possibly slightly higher if considering data transmission, but still very low.\n\n**Therefore, my estimated scores are:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Summary:** The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured API client with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports are consistent, and no changes are necessary to their risk or malware scores.",
