  "purpose": "API client wrapper for OneSignal, constructing request parameters and payloads from input data to interact with the service.",
  "sources": "Function parameters providing data for request payloads and query parameters.",
  "sinks": "Network requests sent via external request functions with constructed URLs, headers, and payloads.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into request payloads or query parameters, which are then sent over the network.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API client, building request details from function inputs and passing them to external request handlers. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The data flow is typical for an API wrapper, with no signs of malicious activity or security flaws. The minimal risk score reflects the handling of sensitive tokens and data, but this is standard for such clients. The high confidence score indicates thorough assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured API client with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "model": "gpt-4.1-nano"
