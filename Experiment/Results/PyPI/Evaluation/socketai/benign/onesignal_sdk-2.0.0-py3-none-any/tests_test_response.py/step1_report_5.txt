  "purpose": "The code defines a test case for the OneSignalResponse class to verify that it correctly sets the body and status code based on a mock HTTP response.",
  "sources": "MockHttpxResponse object creation and its attributes (status code and body)",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is processed in a way that could lead to data leaks or harmful actions",
  "flows": "Instantiation of OneSignalResponse with a mock response, then assertions checking the stored status code and body",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports a response class from a third-party SDK and a mock class for testing. It creates a mock HTTP response with a status code and body, then uses this to instantiate a response object. The test asserts that the response object correctly retains the status code and body. No untrusted input processing, no code execution, or data leakage is involved. The code appears to be standard unit test code focused on verifying functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs straightforward unit testing of a response object without any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and does not contain obfuscation or malware indicators.",
