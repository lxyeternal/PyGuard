{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a test case for the OneSignalResponse class, verifying that it correctly sets its status code and body based on a mocked HTTP response.",
  "sources": "MockHttpxResponse instance providing the simulated HTTP response with status code and body",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is directly processed or transmitted to external systems",
  "flows": "Initialization of OneSignalResponse with a mock response, then assertions to verify correct attribute assignment",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward unit test without suspicious or unusual constructs",
  "analysis": "The code imports a response class and a mock response class, then defines a test function that creates a mock HTTP response with a specific status code and body. It initializes the response object and asserts that its attributes match the mock response data. The code is typical for unit testing, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard unit test verifying attribute assignment in a response object. There are no malicious behaviors or security risks present. It solely tests internal logic without external data leaks or suspicious activity.",
