  "purpose": "Unit test verifying attribute assignment in OneSignalResponse class using a mock response object.",
  "sources": "MockHttpxResponse object providing status code and body data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external system interactions; data is controlled within the test.",
  "flows": "Mock response data flows into OneSignalResponse constructor, with attribute assignments verified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation detected; code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, controlled unit test that creates a mock HTTP response and verifies attribute assignment in the response class. It uses static, trusted mock data, with no external input or code execution involved. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities. The code structure and data flow are standard for testing purposes, with no anomalies or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The confidence score is high (1), given the straightforward analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit test with no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It uses controlled mock data and performs simple attribute verification. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent, indicating no security concerns or malicious behavior.",
