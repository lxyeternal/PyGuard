{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a unit test for the OneSignalResponse class, verifying that it correctly sets its status code and body from an HTTP response.",
  "sources": "MockHttpxResponse object created with status code 201 and a body dictionary",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or executes untrusted data directly; no data leaks or insecure operations are present",
  "flows": "Input mock response -> Instantiate OneSignalResponse -> Assert properties",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; use of mocks and straightforward assertions are standard in testing",
  "analysis": "The code defines a test class that creates a mock HTTP response with fixed status and body, then verifies that the response object correctly captures these values. No dynamic or untrusted input handling, no code injection, or malicious behavior detected. The usage of mock objects is typical for testing purposes and does not introduce security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard unit test for a response class, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It simply verifies expected behavior with controlled mock data.",
