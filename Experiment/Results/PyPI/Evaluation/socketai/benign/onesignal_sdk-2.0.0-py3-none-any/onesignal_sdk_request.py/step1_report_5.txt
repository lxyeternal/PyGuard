{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for constructing and sending authenticated HTTP requests to an API, specifically using basic authentication, both synchronously and asynchronously.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: token, payload, params (function arguments), and response data from httpx requests.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data: token (used in Authorization header), payload, params; Response handling raises exceptions or returns custom response objects.",
  "flows": "Token is inserted into headers as an Authorization Basic header, and payload/params are included in the request; the response is checked for errors and wrapped in a custom response object.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. No evident malicious network activity or data leakage embedded in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs request parameters safely, passing user input into headers, payload, and params, then makes HTTP requests with proper error handling. The code does not include any hardcoded secrets or suspicious URL/domain usage. The functions are standard wrappers around httpx requests, with no apparent malicious behavior or malicious intent. There are no obfuscated parts or suspicious code flows.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate utility for making authenticated HTTP requests with proper error handling. No indicators of malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
