  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Utility functions for making authenticated HTTP requests, handling responses.\n- Findings: No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation, no suspicious code patterns.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The low security risk score (0.2) seems reasonable given the code's straightforward nature. The malware score is correctly 0, as no malicious activity is detected. The confidence level is high (0.9). No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Facilitates making HTTP requests with optional basic auth.\n- Findings: No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, standard patterns.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.95.\n\n**Assessment:** The low security risk score (0.1) is appropriate. The code is standard, and no malicious behavior is evident. The confidence is high.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Constructs and sends HTTP requests, handles responses.\n- Findings: No suspicious patterns, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** The assessment aligns with the code's nature. The security risk remains low, and malware score is correctly 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Utility functions for HTTP requests with optional authorization.\n- Findings: No malicious behaviors, no backdoors, no obfuscation.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** The code appears safe, with no security concerns. The scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Utility functions for authenticated HTTP requests.\n- Findings: No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** The code is straightforward and safe. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity or code is present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slight variation, but all are very low (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting minimal concern. Given the code's simplicity and lack of secrets or malicious patterns, these are reasonable.\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** The code is standard, with no evident vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores Justification:** All scores align with the code's nature.\n- **Potential Vulnerabilities:** No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the code is straightforward.\n- **Malware and Obfuscation:** Correctly scored as 0 across all reports.\n- **Risk Score:** The slightly higher risk scores (0.1-0.2) are justified given the use of tokens in headers, but since tokens are passed as parameters and not hardcoded, the risk remains low.\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a typical API request utility with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n---\n\n### My Final Estimate:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (to reflect minimal risk due to token handling, but no actual vulnerability)\n\nThis assessment confirms the code is safe, well-structured, and free of malicious intent.",
