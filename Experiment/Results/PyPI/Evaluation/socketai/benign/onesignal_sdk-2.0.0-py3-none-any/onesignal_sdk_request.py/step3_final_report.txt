  "purpose": "Utility functions for constructing and sending HTTP requests with optional basic authentication, handling responses, and raising errors on failure.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as token, payload, and params used in request construction; response object from httpx request.",
  "sinks": "Response handling may raise exceptions on HTTP errors; no data leaks or malicious sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (token, payload, params) flow into request construction; request sent via httpx; response processed and errors raised if status code >= 300.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of HTTP request helpers supporting synchronous and asynchronous operations. It constructs request parameters securely, handles responses by raising exceptions on errors, and does not contain obfuscation or malicious code. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are present. The use of tokens in headers is standard, and the code adheres to best practices for API clients. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to external factors like transport security, which are outside the code scope. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, assigning appropriate malware and obfuscation scores (0), and low security risk scores (~0.1-0.2).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented utility for making authenticated API requests. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's benign and standard nature.",
