  "sources": "Input parameters: token, payload, params from function arguments; response from httpx request.",
  "sinks": "Request headers with Authorization token; response handling that may raise exceptions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> _build_request_kwargs -> httpx.request -> _handle_response -> return response or raise error.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual code patterns. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines standard request helpers with optional token-based authentication and response handling. No data leaks, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. Uses standard libraries and safe patterns. No suspicious data flows or anomalies found.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of HTTP request helpers for the OneSignal API. No malicious intent or security risks identified.",
