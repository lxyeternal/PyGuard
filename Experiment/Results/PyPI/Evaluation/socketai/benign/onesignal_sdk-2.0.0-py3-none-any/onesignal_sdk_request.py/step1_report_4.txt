  "purpose": "Utility functions for making HTTP requests with optional authorization and handling responses for a notification service client.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: token, payload, params; Response object from httpx library",
  "sinks": "HTTP request execution via httpx.request and client.request; raising exceptions in case of error status",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> _build_request_kwargs -> HTTP request -> _handle_response -> return response or raise error",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials are only in authorization headers which are standard; no suspicious data leakage or backdoors",
  "analysis": "The code constructs request parameters with optional authorization token, payload, and parameters, then makes synchronous or asynchronous HTTP requests. Response handling raises errors on HTTP status >= 300. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or suspicious network activity is present. The code follows typical patterns for API clients. No hardcoded secrets aside from the provided token in headers, which is expected. No obfuscated or malicious code features identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard HTTP client utility with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It securely handles request construction and response processing without any suspicious behavior.",
