{
  "purpose": "This code constructs and sends HTTP requests with optional authentication and handles responses for a client interacting with an API, likely for notification services.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as token, payload, and params used in request construction; incoming response from httpx request.",
  "sinks": "Sending HTTP requests via httpx.request or client.request; raising exceptions in case of errors.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to build request_kwargs, which are then used to make HTTP requests. Responses are processed to raise errors or return response objects.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns. No hardcoded secrets or dynamic code execution observed. The code uses standard request handling with no obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines helper functions to build request parameters, handle responses, and make synchronous/asynchronous HTTP requests with optional token-based authentication. It properly manages response errors by raising specific exceptions. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The code is straightforward, adhering to common patterns for HTTP request handling. No hardcoded credentials or insecure practices are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard HTTP client module for making authenticated requests to an API, with proper error handling. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. The implementation appears safe and intended for legitimate use.",
