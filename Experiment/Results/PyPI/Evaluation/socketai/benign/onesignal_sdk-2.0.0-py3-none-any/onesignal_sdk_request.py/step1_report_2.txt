{
  "purpose": "The code facilitates making HTTP requests to an API endpoint with optional basic authentication, handling responses, and raising errors on failure.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: token, payload, params; HTTP request method, URL, and headers; response object.",
  "sinks": "Sending HTTP requests via httpx.request and client.request; raising exceptions; returning response objects.",
  "flows": "Token and payload/params are used to build request headers and data; request is sent; response is handled for errors or success.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials; no obfuscated code; no unusual or suspicious logic; standard request handling and error management.",
  "analysis": "The code defines helper functions to construct request parameters, handle responses, and make synchronous/asynchronous requests with optional authentication. It uses standard libraries and patterns without hidden or malicious behavior. No external data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious side effects are evident. The response handling and request construction are straightforward and conform to typical API client patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility module for API requests with proper error handling. No malicious or suspicious code elements are present. It does not exhibit malware behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
