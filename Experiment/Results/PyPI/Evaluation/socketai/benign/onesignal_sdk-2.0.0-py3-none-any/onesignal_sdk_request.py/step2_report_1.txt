  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the reports:**\n\n- All five reports describe the same code: utility functions for making HTTP requests with optional basic authentication, handling responses, and raising errors on failure.\n- They consistently state that the code is straightforward, uses standard libraries, and exhibits no obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious patterns.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or above), and all scores for malware and obfuscation are zero.\n- Security risk scores are very low, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the presence of issues:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears syntactically correct and functionally sound.\n- **Malicious activity:** No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent are evident.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution.\n- **Secrets or hardcoded credentials:** Only the token is used in headers, which is standard practice; no hardcoded secrets are present.\n- **Suspicious patterns:** No suspicious data flows, network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n\n- The logic for building requests and handling responses is standard and correct.\n- Response error handling raises a custom exception, which is appropriate.\n- Asynchronous and synchronous variants are correctly implemented.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is appropriate; no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is correct.\n- **Security risk score:** Very low, as expected.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n\n- The reports assume the code is only utility functions without malicious intent, which seems justified.\n- No vulnerabilities are claimed or implied beyond standard API request handling.\n- The use of the token in headers is standard for basic auth; no issues there.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nGiven the detailed analysis, **the code is a standard, well-implemented utility module for making authenticated API requests.** There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** — very low, reflecting the benign nature of the code, primarily because it handles user input and network requests but does not pose any inherent security risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature. The high confidence levels are justified. No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores, with a very low security risk score (~0.1), and confirm that the code is safe and intended for legitimate API request handling.",
