  "purpose": "A simple wrapper class for handling HTTP responses from the OneSignal API, encapsulating status code and JSON body.",
  "sources": "response parameter passed to __init__, specifically response.status_code and response.json()",
  "sinks": "response.json() parsing, which could raise exceptions if response content is malformed",
  "flows": "Input response -> store status_code and parse JSON -> store body",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; potential lack of error handling around response.json(), which may cause runtime exceptions if JSON is invalid",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API response handler with no malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The main concern is the absence of error handling for response.json(), which could lead to unhandled exceptions, but this is a common pattern rather than malicious. The malware score is 0, as there is no malicious activity. The obfuscated score is 0, given the clarity of the code. The security risk score is slightly elevated to 0.1 or 0.2 due to missing error handling, but not indicative of security threats. Overall, the code is benign and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard API response wrapper with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The minor robustness concern regarding error handling does not significantly impact security. The scores are appropriate; malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2.",
