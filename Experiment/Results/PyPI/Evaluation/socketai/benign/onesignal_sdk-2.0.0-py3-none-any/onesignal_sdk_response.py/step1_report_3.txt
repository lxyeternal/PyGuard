{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class to handle and represent a successful response from the OneSignal API using the httpx library.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the response object passed to the class constructor, specifically response.status_code and response.json().",
  "sinks": "The response.json() call parses the response body, which could potentially contain untrusted data if the response is malicious or malformed.",
  "flows": "Input: response object → Processing: storing status_code and parsing JSON body → Output: storing parsed data in class attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it initializes an object with an HTTP response, captures its status code, and attempts to parse its JSON body. There are no evident malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious side effects. The use of response.json() is standard for handling API responses but could raise issues if the response body is maliciously crafted, though this is common in legitimate API handling. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple data wrapper for API responses with no malicious intent or malicious code. It does not perform any harmful actions, and its use of httpx.Response is typical for API integrations.",
