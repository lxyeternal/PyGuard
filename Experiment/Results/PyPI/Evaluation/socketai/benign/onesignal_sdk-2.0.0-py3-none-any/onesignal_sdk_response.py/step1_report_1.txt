{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class to handle and represent a successful response from the OneSignal API, encapsulating the HTTP response details.",
  "sources": "Reads the response object passed into the constructor, specifically accessing response.status_code and response.json().",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data into sensitive operations or external systems are present.",
  "flows": "The response object is received, its status_code and json() are accessed, and stored within the class instance.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures are present. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports httpx and defines a class for handling responses. The constructor takes an httpx.Response object, stores it, and extracts the status code and JSON body. There are no suspicious behaviors, no input/output manipulations, or external data processing that could indicate malicious intent. The code is simple, standard, and lacks any obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for handling API responses with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears safe and typical for API response handling.",
