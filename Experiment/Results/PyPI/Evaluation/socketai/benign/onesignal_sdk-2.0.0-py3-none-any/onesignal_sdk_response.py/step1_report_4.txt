{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class for handling responses from the OneSignal API, encapsulating an HTTP response object.",
  "sources": "Reads data from an httpx.Response object passed during initialization.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; the code processes the response but does not send data to external systems or perform unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "Input response object -> stores response -> extracts JSON body.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward response handling. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the httpx library, defines a class for representing successful API responses, and initializes attributes with the HTTP response, status code, and JSON body. The use of response.json() assumes the response is valid JSON, but no error handling is present. However, there are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or security issues. The code is minimal and standard for API response handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple and standard wrapper for handling responses from the OneSignal API. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided fragment.",
