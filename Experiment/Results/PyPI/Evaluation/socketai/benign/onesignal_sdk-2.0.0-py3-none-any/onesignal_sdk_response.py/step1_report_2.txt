  "purpose": "Define a class to handle successful responses from the OneSignal API, encapsulating response status and body.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the httpx.Response object passed into the constructor, specifically response.status_code and response.json().",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks or security effects; no output or external system interaction observed.",
  "flows": "Response object -> Class constructor -> assigns status_code and body from response; no further data flow or external effects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward data encapsulation. No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports httpx for handling HTTP responses. It defines a class to wrap a response object, storing status code and JSON body. The json() method is called directly without error handling, which could cause runtime exceptions if response content isn't valid JSON, but this is a standard pattern rather than malicious. No input validation, no data leaks, no network activity, and no suspicious logic are present. There are no signs of malware or malicious behavior in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign wrapper for handling HTTP responses from OneSignal API calls. There are no security threats, malware, or suspicious behavior identified.",
