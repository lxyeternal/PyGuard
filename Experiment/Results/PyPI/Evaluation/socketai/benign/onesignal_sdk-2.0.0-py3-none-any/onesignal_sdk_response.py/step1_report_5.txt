{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class to handle responses from the OneSignal API, encapsulating the HTTP response details.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from an httpx.Response object passed during instantiation, specifically the response JSON content.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data are present; the code only stores and processes the response object.",
  "flows": "Input response object flows into class, with the JSON body extracted and stored in an attribute.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs standard response handling without suspicious constructs or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard HTTP client library (httpx) and defines a class that encapsulates an HTTP response. The constructor stores the response object, captures the status code, and parses the JSON body. There are no dynamic code executions, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious data manipulations. The class is a straightforward data wrapper for API responses, with no evident malicious intent or malicious behavior. It appears to be a simple utility class for API response handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, functioning as a typical response handler for an API client. There are no signs of malicious activity, security risks, or obfuscated code. It is a standard, safe implementation.",
