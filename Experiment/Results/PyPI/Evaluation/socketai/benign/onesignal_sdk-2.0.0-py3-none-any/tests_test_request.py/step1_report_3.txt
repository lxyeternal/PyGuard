{
  "purpose": "Unit testing for the 'basic_auth_request' function in the OneSignal SDK, validating error handling and successful responses.",
  "sources": "Imports from unittest.mock, pytest, and local mock modules. Data sources are the mocked responses and input parameters for tests.",
  "sinks": "The code uses mock.patch to replace 'httpx.request' with controlled responses; no actual data sinks or untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "Test functions invoke 'basic_auth_request' with specific parameters; mocked requests simulate network responses, flow is controlled and isolated.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior. Use of mock responses aligns with standard testing practices.",
  "analysis": "The code defines test cases for handling HTTP responses, mocking network requests with specific response statuses and bodies. No data leaks, hardcoded secrets (other than test token), or malicious code are present. The mock setup is typical for unit tests. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard unit test suite for the 'basic_auth_request' function. It does not contain malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It is safe and well-structured for testing purposes.",
