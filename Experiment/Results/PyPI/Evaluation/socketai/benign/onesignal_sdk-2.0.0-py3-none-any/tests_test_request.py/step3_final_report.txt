{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the 'basic_auth_request' function in the 'onesignal_sdk', testing error handling and successful responses via mocked HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "Mocked 'httpx.request' calls within test functions, simulating network responses.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; mock responses do not process external untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Test functions invoke 'basic_auth_request' with controlled mock responses; no external data flows or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard mocking, no secrets or suspicious code patterns, straightforward test setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of unit tests that mock network responses to verify 'basic_auth_request' behavior. It uses typical testing patterns with no external data leaks, no hardcoded secrets beyond test tokens, and no obfuscated or malicious code. The responses are simulated, and no real network activity occurs. The code does not perform any dangerous operations or handle sensitive data. The tests are well-structured, and the use of mocks ensures safety. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard unit testing suite with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are justified and align with the code's nature.",
