{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for the async_basic_auth_request function, verifying error handling and response correctness using mocks.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from mock HTTP responses and test tokens.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed; the code does not lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Mocked request calls simulate source-to-sink flows; no real data flows occur outside controlled tests.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets beyond test tokens, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured test suite employing mocks to simulate server responses. It verifies error handling and response parsing without processing untrusted input or executing malicious actions. No obfuscation, backdoors, or vulnerabilities are evident. The test tokens are standard for testing purposes. The code does not perform any network or system modifications, and all signals indicate benign behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, security risk score of 0, and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate and justified.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
