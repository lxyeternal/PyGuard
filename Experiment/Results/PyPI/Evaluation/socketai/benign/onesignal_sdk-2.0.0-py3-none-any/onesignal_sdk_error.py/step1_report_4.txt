{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception for handling HTTP errors from the One Signal REST API.",
  "sources": "The response object passed to the _get_message method during exception handling.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code does not write or transmit untrusted data outside the program.",
  "flows": "Response object is used to generate an error message based on the response's status code and JSON body.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code appears straightforward and standard for error handling.",
  "analysis": "The class captures HTTP response errors by examining the status code and parsing the JSON response body for error messages. It uses the response object to extract error details, which are then stored in attributes. No input/output beyond standard exception messaging is performed, and there are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code behavior. The code strictly handles exceptions and formats messages accordingly.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a standard custom exception for handling API errors, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It reads data from the response object to generate error messages but does not perform any unsafe operations or data leaks.",
