  "purpose": "Custom exception class for handling errors from One Signal API responses, extracting status code and error messages from JSON response.",
  "sources": "response.json() call to parse the JSON body of the HTTP response.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only reads data from the response object.",
  "flows": "response.json() -> error message extraction -> stored in exception message.",
  "anomalies": "Assumes response.json() always succeeds; no exception handling for invalid JSON.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward error handler that captures an HTTP response, extracts the status code, and attempts to parse JSON to retrieve error messages. It does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious operations. The JSON parsing assumes well-formed responses; lack of error handling for JSON parsing is a minor robustness concern but not a security issue. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The code's simplicity and purpose align with standard API error handling practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of an API error handler with no malicious or security concerns. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero. No modifications are necessary.",
