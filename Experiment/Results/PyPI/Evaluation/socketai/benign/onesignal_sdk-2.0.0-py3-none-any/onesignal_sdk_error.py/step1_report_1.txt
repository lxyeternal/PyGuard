  "purpose": "Define a custom exception for handling errors from One Signal API responses.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the 'response' object passed to the exception, specifically response.json() and response.status_code.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is written or sent out, only read from the response object.",
  "flows": "The code reads response data in _get_message and assigns it to the message attribute; no data flows to external systems or files.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code performs straightforward error handling without unusual or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The class initializes with an HTTP response, extracts the status code, and attempts to parse a JSON response body to generate an error message. It checks for 'errors' in the JSON and uses the first error if present. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues. The code relies on the response object but does not perform any network activity or data exfiltration itself.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of a custom exception class for handling API errors. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It simply processes the response object to extract error information.",
