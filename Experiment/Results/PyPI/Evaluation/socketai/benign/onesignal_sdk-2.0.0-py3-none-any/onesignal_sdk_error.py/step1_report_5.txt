{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception for handling errors from OneSignal API responses.",
  "sources": "The code reads the response object passed to the exception constructor and extracts JSON data from it.",
  "sinks": "The code accesses response.json() which could potentially be unsafe if the response is maliciously crafted, but this is standard API response handling.",
  "flows": "Response object is passed to the exception, _get_message extracts status code and JSON body, then possibly reads 'errors' from the JSON.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; standard exception handling for API errors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception that captures the HTTP response, retrieves the status code, and extracts error messages from the JSON body. It uses response.json() to parse the response, which is common in API error handling. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. There are no hardcoded credentials or backdoors. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated elements or suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for handling API errors with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
