  "purpose": "Define a custom exception for handling errors from OneSignal REST API responses.",
  "sources": "Reads the httpx.Response object to extract status code and response body.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no data is written to external systems or files, nor is there untrusted data execution.",
  "flows": "The exception class uses the response to generate an error message based on response status and body.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a custom exception that captures HTTP response details from an API call. It extracts the status code and attempts to parse the JSON response to retrieve error messages. The design is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, no network operations, and no security-sensitive data handling beyond response parsing. There are no indications of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, safe exception class for handling API response errors. It does not contain malicious behavior or security issues.",
