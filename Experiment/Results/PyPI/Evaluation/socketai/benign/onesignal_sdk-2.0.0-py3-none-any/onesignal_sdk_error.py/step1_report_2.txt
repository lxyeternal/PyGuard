{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception for handling errors from One Signal REST API responses.",
  "sources": "Reads the response object passed to the exception, specifically accessing response.json() and response.status_code.",
  "sinks": "Uses response.json() which involves parsing JSON data, but no untrusted data handling or external output is performed.",
  "flows": "Response object is received and parsed within the exception class; the flow is straightforward from response to error message generation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic. The exception class performs standard error message extraction.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an exception class that captures and formats error messages from HTTP responses. It accesses the response JSON to retrieve error details. No data leaks, code injection, or malicious actions are present. The code relies on the response object but does not perform network actions or data exfiltration. The logic is standard for exception handling related to HTTP errors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward exception handler for API errors, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is part of error handling and does not perform any unsafe operations.",
