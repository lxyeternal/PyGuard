  "conclusion": "The dependency exhibits low risk overall but contains notable suspicious elements, especially related to obfuscation and dynamic code execution. Adjusted scores reflect moderate concern, warranting further static and dynamic analysis to confirm malicious intent. The most suspicious reports (2 and 5) justify higher malware and obfuscation scores, while benign reports remain low risk."
