{
  "purpose": "To evaluate supply chain security risks in the open source dependency based on multiple reports, identifying malicious indicators, obfuscation, and overall security posture.",
  "sources": "Use of eval()/exec(), network activity, obfuscated code segments, hardcoded secrets, indirect data flows, incomplete code snippets.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, eval()/exec() calls, file modifications, environment variable access, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as untrusted input or code snippets flow into eval()/exec() or network functions; obfuscated code complicates flow analysis; potential data leaks through network or file sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic code execution with untrusted data, high obfuscation scores, incomplete code, indirect data flows, suspicious variable names, and complex control flows without clear purpose.",
  "analysis": "The reports collectively identify some code as benign with high confidence and low scores for malware and obfuscation. Others highlight suspicious behaviors such as eval()/exec() usage, obfuscation, and network activity, justifying higher scores. Adjustments are recommended: increasing malware scores for reports indicating dynamic execution and obfuscation (notably reports 2 and 5). The overall pattern suggests moderate risk with potential for malicious activity but no confirmed payloads. The scores are aligned with the described behaviors, emphasizing caution where obfuscation and dynamic code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency exhibits low risk overall but contains notable suspicious elements, especially related to obfuscation and dynamic code execution. Adjusted scores reflect moderate concern, warranting further static and dynamic analysis to confirm malicious intent. The most suspicious reports (2 and 5) justify higher malware and obfuscation scores, while benign reports remain low risk.",
