  "purpose": "Assess the security posture of the open source dependency by analyzing code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Potential dynamic code execution points (eval, exec), input/output data points, import statements, environment variable usage, network connections, and obfuscated variables.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows leading to code execution, data leakage, or network transmission; dynamic imports or eval usage that could execute malicious code.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or environment variables may flow into eval, exec, or dynamic import statements, potentially leading to malicious actions or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval, dynamic imports, obfuscated variable names, conditional logic designed to obscure intent, hardcoded secrets, or unusual control flow patterns.",
  "analysis": "The reports generally align their scores with their reasoning. Report 3 shows significant obfuscation and eval usage, warranting a higher malware score (~0.5). Other reports are mostly benign, with low obfuscation and no suspicious activity. The scores for malware (~0.3 overall), obfuscation (~0.2), and security risk (~0.3) reflect a moderate threat level, considering the suspicious features in Report 3. Minor adjustments include increasing Report 3's malware score from 0.4 to 0.5 for better accuracy. The overall assessment indicates no confirmed malicious payloads but highlights obfuscation and dynamic code as potential concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits some suspicious features, primarily in Report 3, which justifies a moderate malware and risk score. Other reports are benign. The overall security posture is moderate, with attention needed for obfuscation and dynamic code execution indicators.",
