  "purpose": "Retrieve environment-specific settings and determine whether to show a notice based on user authentication status.",
  "sources": "Reading user authentication status from request object; reading environment configuration from Django settings.",
  "sinks": "None of the data is used in a way that could directly cause data leakage, code injection, or other security issues. No untrusted input is processed or output.",
  "flows": "User authentication status from request → show_notice function → return value; Settings attributes from settings module → from_settings function → dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. Use of environment variables and settings is standard practice. No evidence of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code simply accesses Django request properties and settings attributes, returning information relevant for rendering UI components. No user input is processed unsafely, no sensitive data is leaked, and no suspicious behaviors are present. All data accesses are read-only and straightforward. No malicious code or supply chain risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django view utility for rendering environment-based notices and configuration. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified based on the provided code.",
