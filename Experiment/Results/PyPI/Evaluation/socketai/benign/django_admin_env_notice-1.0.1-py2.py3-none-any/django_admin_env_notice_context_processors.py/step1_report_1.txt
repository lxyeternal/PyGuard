{
  "purpose": "Retrieve environment-specific settings and determine whether to show a notice based on user authentication status.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'settings' object using 'getattr' calls, and the request object for user authentication status.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs a dictionary containing environment variables; no data sinks or external data flows are present.",
  "flows": "Input from request object (user authentication) influences the 'show_notice' output; environment variables are fetched from 'settings' without influence from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected. Usage of 'getattr' with default values is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code simply accesses configuration settings and user authentication status to determine UI display logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscated code. No external data is fetched or sent, and no sensitive information is handled beyond environment variables. The code is straightforward and adheres to common Django practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for fetching environment configurations and user authentication status without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any harmful actions or suspicious data handling.",
