  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code, and evaluate the correctness of their conclusions, scores, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code simply reads environment variables from Django settings and checks user authentication status.\n- There are no external data flows, no input validation issues, no data leaks, and no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- The code does not perform any data modification, network communication, or dynamic code execution.\n- The use of `getattr` with defaults is standard practice.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The functions are straightforward utility functions typical in Django projects.\n\n---\n\n### Specific review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; the code is straightforward and safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues. The report is correct, and scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; standard Django code with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues. The report is accurate, and scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct assessment; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; standard configuration access.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusion:\n\n- **Code presence:** The code is as provided; no deviations or hidden behaviors.\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, as code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** All 0, consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Confidence:** 1, justified by the clear and standard code.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No adjustments needed; the code is safe and standard.\n- The scores reflect the absence of malicious or obfuscated code, and the security risk is negligible.\n\n---\n\n### **My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a simple, well-understood utility pattern with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** All reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's nature. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.",
