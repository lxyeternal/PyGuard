  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, the code's behavior, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code only reads configuration from Django settings and the request object.\n- It performs straightforward checks: whether a user is authenticated, and retrieves environment variables.\n- No data is written, sent externally, or processed in an unsafe manner.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present.\n- No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or external data flows are evident.\n- The code adheres to standard Django practices.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming issues and logic\n\n**Are the reported issues present?**  \nYes. All reports describe the code as a simple, standard utility for environment config and user auth status checks. No issues or vulnerabilities are identified.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in reasoning?**  \nNo. The reports correctly interpret the code as benign and standard.\n\n**Scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, securityRisk):**  \nAll reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, and securityRisk as 0, which is consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points per report:\n\n**Report 1-5:**\n\n- Purpose, sources, sinks, flows, anomalies, analysis, conclusion, confidence — all consistent.\n- The reasoning is sound: no malicious activity, no data leaks, no obfuscation.\n\n**Score review:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — correct, no malware.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — correct, code is straightforward.\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0 — correct, no vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n\n- No reason exists to assign higher scores given the code's simplicity and safety.\n- The environment variables are accessed via `getattr` with defaults, which is safe.\n- The user authentication check is standard.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese align with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and well-reasoned. The code is a standard Django utility for configuration and user authentication status, with no malicious or risky behavior. The scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n**My final estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nNo changes needed. The code is safe, and the reports correctly reflect that.",
