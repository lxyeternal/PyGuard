  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is straightforward Django utility functions: fetching environment variables and checking user authentication.\n- All reports agree that the code is standard, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The data sources are trusted (request object and Django settings), and no external or untrusted data flows are present.\n- The code does not perform any data modification, external communication, or dynamic code execution.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues:**  \n   - No issues are present in the code. No vulnerabilities, malicious behaviors, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n\n3. **Scores assigned:**  \n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The confidence scores are 1, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Risk scores justification:**  \n   - Since the code is simple configuration access with no malicious intent, the risk score should remain at 0.\n   - Malware score should be 0 because there's no malicious activity.\n   - Obfuscated score should be 0; the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - Security risk score should be 0; no vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n5. **Claims about potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that the code is standard and safe.\n\n6. **Consistency of scores:**  \n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Final evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll reports are accurate and align with the code's nature. The code is benign, with no security concerns or malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a typical configuration utility with no issues.",
