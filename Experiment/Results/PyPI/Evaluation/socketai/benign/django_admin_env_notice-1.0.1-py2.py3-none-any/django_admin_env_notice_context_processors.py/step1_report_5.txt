  "purpose": "The code defines utility functions to retrieve environment-specific settings and determine user authentication status within a Django web application.",
  "sources": "Access to Django settings via getattr() and request.user.is_authenticated.",
  "sinks": "None identified; code only reads configuration and user authentication status, no data is written or sent.",
  "flows": "The request object is used to check user authentication status; settings are read via getattr(). No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed. The environment variables are accessed in a standard way.",
  "analysis": "The code safely accesses configuration parameters from Django settings and checks user authentication status. No user input is directly used, and no external communication or file operations are present. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or malicious code are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard utility code for environment configuration and user authentication check within a Django app. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
