  "sources": "Django settings via getattr and the request.user object.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is written or transmitted externally.",
  "flows": "Request object provides user info; settings provide environment variables; no untrusted data flows to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code reads environment variables using getattr with defaults, which is safe. It checks user authentication status. No external data flows, no data modification, no network communication, and no obfuscated or malicious code are present. The logic is simple and adheres to Django best practices. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are detected. The code's behavior is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for environment configuration and user authentication checks, with no malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, with high confidence. No adjustments are necessary.",
