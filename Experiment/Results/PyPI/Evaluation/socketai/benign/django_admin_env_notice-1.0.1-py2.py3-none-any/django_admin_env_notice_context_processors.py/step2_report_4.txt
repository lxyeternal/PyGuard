  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as straightforward, standard Django utility functions.\n- No suspicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external data flows are identified.\n- The code only reads from trusted sources (request object and Django settings).\n- No external communication, data exfiltration, or malicious code is evident.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code appears correct and secure.\n- No vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or suspicious logic are present.\n- The purpose, data flows, and sources are all benign.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are evident.\n- The use of `getattr` with defaults is standard practice and safe.\n- The code adheres to Django best practices.\n\n### Score assessments:\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n- These scores seem appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n### Risk scores:\n- Since there's no malicious or risky behavior, the overall risk score should be very low, ideally 0 or close to it.\n- The reports' assigned scores are consistent with this.\n\n### Justification for higher scores:\n- No justification exists for higher malware or security risk scores.\n- The code is transparent, simple, and safe.\n\n### Potential assumptions or claims:\n- All reports correctly interpret the code as benign.\n- No assumptions about hidden malicious behavior are made.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n**Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard, safe implementation for retrieving environment settings and user authentication status. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- No issues are present in the code.  \n- The reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code.  \n- The scoring should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.",
