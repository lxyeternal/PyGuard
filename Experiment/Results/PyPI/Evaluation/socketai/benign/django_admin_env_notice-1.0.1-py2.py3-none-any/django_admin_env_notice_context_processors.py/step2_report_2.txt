  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as straightforward, standard Django utility functions for retrieving environment settings and user authentication status.\n- No suspicious or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- The code uses common practices such as `getattr` with defaults, and reads data only from trusted sources (`settings`, `request` object).\n- No external data flows, data exfiltration, or obfuscation are detected.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code matches the description: it reads environment variables from Django settings and checks user authentication.\n- No issues with the code's logic or security are evident.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present.\n- The data flow is safe, with no untrusted input being processed insecurely.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No errors or flaws are identified in the code or the reports.\n- The reasoning in all reports is consistent and accurate.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- The reports assign a `malware` score of 0, which is justified.\n- The `securityRisk` score is 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- The `obfuscated` score is 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- The confidence level is 1, indicating high certainty.\n\n### Potential Concerns:\n- Since all reports are consistent and the code is simple, there are no assumptions to challenge.\n- The only consideration is whether any of the environment variables or settings could be maliciously configured in the deployment environment, but that is outside the scope of this code review.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, safe utility for environment configuration and user authentication checks, with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is safe, straightforward, and aligns with best practices. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
