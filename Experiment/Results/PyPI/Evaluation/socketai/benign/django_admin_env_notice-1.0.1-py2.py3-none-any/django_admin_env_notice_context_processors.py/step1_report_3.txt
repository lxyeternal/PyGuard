{
  "purpose": "The code defines utility functions to retrieve environment-related settings and a display notice based on user authentication status in a Django application.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'request' object and Django 'settings' using 'getattr'.",
  "sinks": "No data is written to external systems, network, or files. No untrusted data is passed to unsafe functions.",
  "flows": "The 'show_notice' function uses 'request.user.is_authenticated' and 'settings' attributes. The 'from_settings' function retrieves multiple environment variables from 'settings'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present. The code performs straightforward configuration retrieval.",
  "analysis": "The code safely accesses user authentication status and configuration variables from Django settings. All data reads are from trusted sources: 'request' object and 'settings'. No input validation or unsafe operations are performed. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The functions simply read configuration data and user state for rendering or logic purposes. No obfuscated code, hidden behavior, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard Django utility code for configuration and user state checks. It does not contain malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. It is safe for use, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
