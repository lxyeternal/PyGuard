  "purpose": "Define and retrieve the version information of a Django-related package/module.",
  "sources": "The __version_info__ dictionary and the get_version() function, which accesses this dictionary.",
  "sinks": "The return statement in get_version(), which outputs a version string based on the version info.",
  "flows": "The get_version() function reads from __version_info__ and returns a constructed version string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward version info handling with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version info dictionary and a function to generate a version string. It performs a simple assert to validate 'releaselevel' and constructs a version string based on the dictionary. No external inputs, no untrusted data sources, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious logic or behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version info utility with no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security concerns.",
