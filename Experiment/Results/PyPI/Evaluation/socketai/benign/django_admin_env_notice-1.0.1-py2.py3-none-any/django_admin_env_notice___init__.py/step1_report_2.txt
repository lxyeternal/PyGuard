  "purpose": "Define and retrieve the version information of the package",
  "sources": "The __version_info__ dictionary and the get_version() function",
  "sinks": "The return value of get_version(), which constructs a version string",
  "flows": "The __version__ variable is assigned the output of get_version()",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code declares version info in a dictionary, then defines a function to generate a version string based on that info. It asserts the release level is valid, constructs a version string conditionally based on version components, and assigns the result to __version__.\n\nThe code is straightforward, with no external input, no data leaks, no unsafe operations, and no malicious behavior. It performs basic version string formatting, a common pattern in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for version management in Python packages, with no signs of malicious intent, supply chain attack, or security risks.",
