  "purpose": "Provides version information for a Python package, constructing a version string based on predefined version info.",
  "sources": "The __version_info__ dictionary and the get_version() function, which reads from the dictionary and the assertion check.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external operations.",
  "flows": "The get_version() function reads from __version_info__ and constructs a string; no external data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with a simple assertion and string formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code defines static version info and constructs a version string with validation. It contains no external inputs, no obfuscation, no malicious code, and performs only benign operations. The assertion ensures releaselevel is valid. No suspicious patterns, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is typical for version management in Python packages, with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious or security-related issues. The reports correctly identify its harmless nature. The assigned malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores are appropriate and can remain at zero. No further action or concern is warranted.",
