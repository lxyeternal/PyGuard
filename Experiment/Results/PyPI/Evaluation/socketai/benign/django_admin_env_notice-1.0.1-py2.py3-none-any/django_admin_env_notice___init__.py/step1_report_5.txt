  "purpose": "Defines version information and provides a function to generate version strings for the package.",
  "sources": "Access to the __version_info__ dictionary and its keys within the get_version function.",
  "sinks": "Return statement of get_version, providing the version string.",
  "flows": "Accessing __version_info__ dictionary -> building version string -> returning version string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code uses assertions to validate 'releaselevel'. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious operations. The assertion ensures 'releaselevel' is one of the expected values.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version info dictionary and a function to generate version strings based on it. The get_version function constructs the version string conditionally, based on release level and micro version. The assertion enforces expected release levels. There are no suspicious or malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security risks. The code appears to be a straightforward version utility module.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, safe version info utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely to provide version strings based on predefined data.",
