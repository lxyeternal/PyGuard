  "flows": "Access to __version_info__ dictionary -> get_version() processing -> return version string.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code; straightforward version info handling with assertions.",
  "analysis": "The code declares a version info dictionary, and a function get_version() that constructs a version string based on this info. It asserts that the release level is valid, then builds the version string accordingly, including micro version and release level if not final and if not short. There are no external inputs, no untrusted data handling, no network operations, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be a simple version management utility typical for Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version information module with no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks detected.",
