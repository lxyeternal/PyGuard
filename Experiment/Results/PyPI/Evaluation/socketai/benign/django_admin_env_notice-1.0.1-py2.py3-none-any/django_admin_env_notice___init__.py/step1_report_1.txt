  "purpose": "Defines version information and provides a function to generate a version string for the package.",
  "sources": "The __version_info__ dictionary and the get_version() function that accesses it.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or write to external systems.",
  "flows": "The get_version() function reads __version_info__ and constructs a version string, which is assigned to __version__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, does not include obfuscated constructs, and contains no suspicious logic or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code sets version metadata and defines a function to format this data into a version string. It uses assertions to verify release level values, constructs a version string based on the info, and assigns it to __version__. There are no sources of untrusted input, no data flows involving external systems, and no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, focusing solely on version information management. No signs of malicious activity or security risks are present.",
