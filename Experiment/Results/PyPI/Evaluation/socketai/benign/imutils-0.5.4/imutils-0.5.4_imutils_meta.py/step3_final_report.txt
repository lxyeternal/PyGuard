  "purpose": "Utility function to find and list functions within a specified module (default cv2) matching a given pattern.",
  "sources": "dir(module) attribute listing, re.search pattern matching on attribute names",
  "sinks": "None; the code only inspects and prints attribute names, no data leaks or external communications",
  "flows": "Input pattern string -> regex filtering on dir(module) -> optional printing or returning filtered list",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward reflection and filtering, no suspicious or unusual code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code performs a safe, standard introspection task: filtering module attribute names with regex. It does not execute untrusted code, connect to networks, or handle sensitive data. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The use of regex filtering is typical for such utilities and does not introduce security risks. The code's simplicity and purpose are benign, and it is unlikely to be misused maliciously in isolation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for inspecting functions within the cv2 module. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The overall security risk is minimal, around 0.1, reflecting its safe, introspective nature.",
