{
  "purpose": "To find and display function names within the cv2 module that match a given search string.",
  "sources": "The function reads input parameters 'name', 'pretty_print', and 'module', and accesses the 'dir(module)' list of attributes.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks or harmful effects; the code only prints matched function names.",
  "flows": "Input 'name' flows into the regex search filter applied to 'dir(module)', and the filtered list is printed if 'pretty_print' is True.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs a straightforward search and print of function names. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a function to search for functions within a module by name, filters attributes using regex, and optionally prints results. No external data is fetched or transmitted; the code is self-contained. No obfuscated code, malicious backdoors, or malicious logic present. It appears to be a utility function for introspection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for finding functions within a module based on a name pattern. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
