{
  "purpose": "The code provides a utility function to find and list functions within the OpenCV (`cv2`) module that match a given name pattern.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the function parameters (`name`, `pretty_print`, `module`) and uses the `dir()` function to inspect the `cv2` module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data leading to data leaks or effects. The code only performs filtering and printing based on internal module data.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to filter function names within the module, and filtered names are either returned or printed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present. The code uses standard library functions and performs simple string matching and printing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function `find_function` that searches for functions within a specified module (defaulting to `cv2`) whose names contain a given substring, case-insensitive. It employs regular expressions to filter function names obtained via `dir()`. The function can either return the filtered list or print the matching function names, based on the `pretty_print` flag. No external input is processed directly; the parameters are used internally for filtering. The code does not perform any file I/O, network communication, or execute any untrusted code. It appears to be a benign utility intended for introspection of the `cv2` library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility for listing functions in the `cv2` module matching a pattern. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It only performs controlled introspection and printing, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
