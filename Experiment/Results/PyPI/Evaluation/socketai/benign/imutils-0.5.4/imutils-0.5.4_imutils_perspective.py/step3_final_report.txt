{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for ordering points and applying a perspective transform to obtain a top-down view of an image.",
  "sources": "Input points array 'pts', image data passed to 'four_point_transform'.",
  "sinks": "The perspective transform matrix 'M' used internally; no direct data leaks or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Input points 'pts' are ordered, then used to compute the transform matrix 'M', which is applied to 'image' to produce 'warped'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and uses standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a common perspective correction routine with functions 'order_points' and 'four_point_transform'. It relies on numpy, scipy, and OpenCV, performing geometric calculations without network activity or data leaks. No obfuscation or malicious logic is present. The functions are well-structured, and the operations are typical for image rectification tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign image processing utility for perspective correction. No malicious or suspicious activity detected. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk (~0.1) are appropriate.",
