{
  "purpose": "The code performs perspective transformation on an image based on four input points, commonly used for tasks like document scanning or object rectification.",
  "sources": "The code reads input points (pts) and an image (image).",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform security-sensitive operations are present; the code uses standard OpenCV functions.",
  "flows": "Input points are processed to order them, then used to compute a perspective transform which is applied to the image, producing a warped output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual data flows are observed. The code relies solely on external libraries without suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to order four points and perform a perspective transformation. It uses standard numpy and OpenCV functions to process data and perform image warping. There is no indication of malicious behavior or malicious data handling. It appears to be a straightforward implementation of perspective correction without any malicious or suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of image perspective transformation without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not include any suspicious behaviors or malicious data flows.",
