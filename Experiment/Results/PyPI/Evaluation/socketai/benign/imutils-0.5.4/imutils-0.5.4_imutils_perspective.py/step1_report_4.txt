{
  "purpose": "The code performs a perspective transform on an image given four points, likely for image correction or enhancement purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data: the 'image' parameter in four_point_transform and 'pts' parameter in order_points.",
  "sinks": "Processed output: the warped image returned by four_point_transform.",
  "flows": "Input points 'pts' flow into order_points to be ordered; then these points are used in getPerspectiveTransform to compute the transformation matrix, which is applied in warpPerspective to produce the output image.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code relies solely on standard image processing libraries (scipy, numpy, cv2). No external network connections or data leaks are evident. The code functions as a typical perspective transformation without hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for ordering four points of a quadrilateral and applying a perspective transform to an image based on those points. It utilizes standard libraries (scipy, numpy, cv2) for mathematical and image processing operations. The logic follows conventional approaches for image rectification, including sorting points, calculating distances, and applying a perspective warp. No obfuscated or malicious patterns are present; no suspicious data handling or external calls are made. The functions are straightforward, with clear input-output behavior typical of image processing routines.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard image processing utility for perspective correction, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs expected operations using common libraries without suspicious behavior.",
