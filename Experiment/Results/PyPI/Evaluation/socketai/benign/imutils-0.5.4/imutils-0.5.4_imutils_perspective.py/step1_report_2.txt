{
  "purpose": "The code performs a perspective transformation on an image by ordering four points and applying a warp perspective to obtain a top-down view.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data through the function parameters 'pts' (points array) and 'image' (image data).",
  "sinks": "The code outputs the transformed image 'warped' via cv2.warpPerspective.",
  "flows": "Input points 'pts' are ordered in 'order_points', then used to compute a perspective transform matrix 'M' with 'cv2.getPerspectiveTransform', which is then applied to 'image' using 'cv2.warpPerspective' to produce 'warped'.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual or suspicious code patterns; usage of common libraries like numpy and OpenCV for image processing is standard. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code takes four points to define a region of an image, orders them to maintain consistent perspective, computes the maximum width and height for the transformed image, and applies a perspective warp to produce a top-down view. The functions rely solely on standard mathematical and OpenCV functions without any obfuscated or malicious constructs. No external network connections or data leaks are present. The code is a typical image processing utility, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate image perspective transformation utility, with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It uses standard practices and libraries for image manipulation. Therefore, the security risk is minimal.",
