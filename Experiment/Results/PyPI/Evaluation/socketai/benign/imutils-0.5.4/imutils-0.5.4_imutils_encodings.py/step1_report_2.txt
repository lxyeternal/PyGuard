{
  "purpose": "Provide functions for encoding and decoding images and arrays to/from base64 within JSON structures.",
  "sources": "Data is read from JSON strings during decoding functions, and image data is passed as numpy arrays to encoding functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur if the base64-encoded images or arrays are mishandled, but no direct malicious sink (e.g., network transmission) is present.",
  "flows": "Input data (JSON strings or numpy arrays) flows through encoding/decoding functions, involving base64 transformations, JSON parsing, and reshaping arrays.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated 'base64.decodestring' function (replaced by 'base64.b64decode' in newer Python versions). No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code identified.",
  "analysis": "The code offers straightforward functions for encoding and decoding numpy arrays as base64 strings wrapped in JSON. It handles different Python versions for string encoding but uses deprecated functions. No external inputs are fetched directly from untrusted sources, and no network activity, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is clean, functional, and appears secure for its purpose. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or data leaks beyond the expected base64 and JSON handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard encoding/decoding tasks for image data and numpy arrays. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, and no evident security risks. The main concern is the use of deprecated functions, which does not impact security but suggests updating for compatibility.",
