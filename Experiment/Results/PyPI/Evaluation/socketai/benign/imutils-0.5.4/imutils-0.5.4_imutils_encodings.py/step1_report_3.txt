{
  "purpose": "Provide functions to encode and decode images and arrays to/from base64 and JSON formats.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from JSON strings and base64 decoding functions.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; data is processed internally without external output or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input JSON strings, through decoding, base64 decoding/encoding, and reshaping back into arrays.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated function 'base64.decodestring' instead of 'base64.b64decode'. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for encoding and decoding numpy arrays and images via base64 and JSON. It includes standard libraries and numpy for data handling. The only notable issue is the deprecated use of 'base64.decodestring', which has been replaced in newer Python versions by 'base64.b64decode'. No malicious or suspicious code, such as network operations, system commands, or data exfiltration mechanisms, is present. The code appears to serve legitimate data serialization purposes. The code does not process untrusted input directly without validation, and all operations are confined to data transformation without external interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for image and array encoding/decoding with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The main concern is the deprecated function usage, which does not impact security but should be updated for compatibility.",
