  "purpose": "Utility functions for encoding and decoding numpy arrays and images using base64 and JSON serialization.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions, specifically the image array 'a' and JSON strings for decoding.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; data is processed in-memory, with no network or file output.",
  "flows": "Input data (numpy array or JSON string) flows through encoding/decoding functions, transforming data via base64 and JSON serialization/deserialization.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated 'base64.decodestring()' instead of 'base64.b64decode()'; no malicious or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward serialization/deserialization of numpy arrays and images with base64 and JSON. It does not perform network activity, file I/O, or execute external commands. The only technical flaw is the use of a deprecated function, which does not introduce security vulnerabilities. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is clear, well-structured, and relies solely on standard libraries. The deprecated function usage is a maintainability issue, not a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a utility for data serialization. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The only issue is the deprecated 'base64.decodestring()', which should be replaced with 'base64.b64decode()' for compatibility. The overall security risk score is minimal (0.1), and malware score is zero, reflecting no malicious activity.",
