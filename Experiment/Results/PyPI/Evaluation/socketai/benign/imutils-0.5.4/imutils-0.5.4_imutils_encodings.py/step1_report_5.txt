{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for encoding and decoding images and arrays using base64, primarily for data serialization and deserialization.",
  "sources": "Reads data from input parameters in functions (base64 strings, numpy arrays), system information via sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "Uses base64 decoding functions and numpy buffer conversion; no external sinks or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Data is encoded and decoded through base64 and numpy buffers, converting images and arrays to and from JSON-encoded base64 strings.",
  "anomalies": "Uses deprecated function 'base64.decodestring' instead of 'base64.b64decode'; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple functions for encoding and decoding images and numpy arrays using base64, JSON, and system info. The use of 'base64.b64encode' and 'np.frombuffer' is standard, though the use of 'base64.decodestring' is deprecated in Python 3. The code appears to be straightforward serialization/deserialization utilities with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a utility module for encoding and decoding images and numpy arrays with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It contains a deprecated function usage but no malicious behavior or security concerns.",
