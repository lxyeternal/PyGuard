{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to encode and decode images and arrays using base64, mainly for data serialization and deserialization.",
  "sources": "Data inputs come from function parameters: images and arrays; input data from JSON strings for decoding functions.",
  "sinks": "Decoded data is converted into numpy arrays; encoded data is returned as base64 strings. No direct data leaks or network communication is present.",
  "flows": "Input data (images/arrays) is base64 encoded for transport/storage; decoding functions reverse this process. No external untrusted data sources or sinks involved.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated 'base64.decodestring' instead of 'base64.b64decode' is a minor issue but not malicious; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard base64 encoding/decoding for numpy arrays and images, including JSON serialization. The functions perform data conversion tasks without involving external inputs or network operations. The usage of sys.version_info to handle Python version differences is standard. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity are observed. The code appears to be a typical data serialization utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for encoding and decoding numpy arrays and images with base64, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
