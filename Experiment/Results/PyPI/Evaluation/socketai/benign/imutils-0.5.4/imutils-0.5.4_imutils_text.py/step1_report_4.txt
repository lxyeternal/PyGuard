  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for drawing multi-line and centered text on images using OpenCV.",
  "sources": "The code reads image data via the 'img' parameter and text input via the 'text' parameter.",
  "sinks": "The functions call 'cv2.putText' to modify the image in place, but do not write data outside their scope or send data externally.",
  "flows": "Input data (images and text) are processed locally to compute text positioning, then passed to cv2.putText for rendering; no external data flow or network activity occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated constructs, or suspicious operations are present. The code is straightforward, focusing solely on image annotation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two utility functions for text rendering on images: 'put_text' supports multi-line text with line breaks, and 'put_centered_text' handles centered multi-line text. Both functions calculate text sizes, handle line spacing, and modify the image directly using OpenCV's 'cv2.putText'. The parameters are standard for image annotation. There are no input/output beyond local image modification, no external data access, no network communication, and no dynamic execution. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware are evident. The code's purpose is purely for visual annotation, with no data exfiltration or malicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for text rendering on images, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It operates solely on input images and text, performing no external communication or data leaks.",
