  "purpose": "Provides utility functions to draw multi-line and centered text onto images using OpenCV.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for functions: image, text, font details, colors, and positioning coordinates.",
  "sinks": "cv2.putText() function calls which render text onto images.",
  "flows": "Input parameters → Processing text and positioning calculations → cv2.putText() calls to render text.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, network calls, or backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two utility functions for text rendering on images: 'put_text' for drawing multi-line text at specified origin, and 'put_centered_text' for drawing multi-line centered text. Both functions split input text by newline characters, calculate line sizes, and draw text with line spacing adjustments. No external data sources, environment variable usage, or malicious behaviors are evident. No code injection, network activity, or data leakage mechanisms are present. The code relies solely on OpenCV functions and standard Python features. It appears to be a benign utility for image annotation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward implementation of image annotation functions with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is purely for rendering text on images and does not contain any malicious or obfuscated code.",
