  "purpose": "Utility functions for rendering multi-line and centered text on images using OpenCV.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'text' (text string), 'img.shape' (image dimensions).",
  "sinks": "cv2.putText calls with text and position parameters.",
  "flows": "Input text -> size calculations -> position adjustments -> cv2.putText rendering.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of OpenCV functions; no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code provides two utility functions: 'put_text' for drawing multi-line text at a specified origin, and 'put_centered_text' for drawing multi-line, centered text. Both functions split input text into lines, calculate text sizes with 'cv2.getTextSize', determine line spacing, and render each line with 'cv2.putText'. The functions operate solely on in-memory image data, with no external data sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscation are present. The code is benign, straightforward, and uses standard OpenCV methods. No suspicious behaviors, malware, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are justified and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, benign utility for rendering multi-line and centered text on images. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain as is.",
