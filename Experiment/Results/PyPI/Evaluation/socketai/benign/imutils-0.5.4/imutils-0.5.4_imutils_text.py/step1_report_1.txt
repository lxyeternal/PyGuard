{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for drawing multiline and centered text on images using OpenCV.",
  "sources": "The code reads image data via 'img' parameter, font parameters, text input, and formatting options.",
  "sinks": "Uses cv2.putText to modify the input image; no data is sent elsewhere or stored externally.",
  "flows": "Reads image data and font/text parameters; writes text onto the image directly via cv2.putText.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors; no dynamic code execution, external network access, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The functions are straightforward image annotation utilities. They split input text into lines, calculate text dimensions, and draw text onto images with options for multiline and centered alignment. No user input is processed for security-sensitive operations; all data handling is confined to in-memory image modification. No malicious behaviors, hidden backdoors, or suspicious data leaks are present. The code employs standard OpenCV functions for rendering text and manages line spacing and positioning carefully. No signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious intent are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as utility functions for image annotation. No malicious or security risk behaviors are present, and the code appears to be intended solely for text rendering on images.",
