  "purpose": "Utility functions for drawing multiline and centered text on images using OpenCV.",
  "sources": "Input image (img), text string, font parameters, color, optional origin or centering parameters.",
  "sinks": "cv2.putText function calls that modify the image in place, potentially using untrusted text input.",
  "flows": "Input text is split into lines, size calculations are performed, and text is drawn onto the image at calculated positions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. No network operations, file I/O, or secret extraction. The code purely performs image annotation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: 'put_text' for drawing multiline text with specified origin and line spacing, and 'put_centered_text' for drawing centered multiline text. Both functions split the input text, calculate text sizes using OpenCV functions, and draw each line at computed positions. There are no input sanitization, external data sources, or network operations involved. The functions use parameters to control font, size, color, and positioning, but do not process untrusted data in a manner that could lead to malicious behavior. No suspicious dynamic execution or obfuscated code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a straightforward utility for rendering text on images. It does not contain any malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is safe for use and appears to be a standard, benign implementation.",
