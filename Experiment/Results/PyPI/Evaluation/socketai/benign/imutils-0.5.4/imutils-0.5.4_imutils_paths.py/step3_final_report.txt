  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard directory walk, filtering files based on extension and optional substring. It uses safe, built-in functions without network activity or obfuscation. No malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code is straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, benign utility for listing image files. No malicious intent or security risks are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis.",
