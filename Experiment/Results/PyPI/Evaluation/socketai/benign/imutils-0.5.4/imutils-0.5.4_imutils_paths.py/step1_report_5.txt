{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to recursively list image files in a specified directory, optionally filtering by filename contains string.",
  "sources": "The code reads directory structures via os.walk, and filenames within those directories.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data directly leads to data leaks or system effects; it only generates and yields file paths.",
  "flows": "Source: os.walk yields directory contents; flow: filenames are filtered and then combined with rootDir via os.path.join to produce image paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; standard directory traversal and file filtering logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports os for directory traversal and filtering image files based on extensions and optional filename substrings. It defines list_images() which calls list_files() with image extensions. list_files() walks the directory tree, filters filenames based on 'contains' string and extension, then yields full paths. No user input is directly processed here, and no network or system commands are used. The code appears to perform standard file listing without malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward directory traversal utility for listing image files, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as a safe file listing tool.",
