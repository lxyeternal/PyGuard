{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to list image files from a specified directory, filtering by extension and optional substring containment.",
  "sources": "The code reads the directory structure via os.walk, and examines filenames for filtering and extension matching.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data beyond generating file paths; no data is sent over networks, stored insecurely, or executed.",
  "flows": "The data flow involves reading directory contents, filtering filenames based on extension and substring, and yielding file paths.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors observed. The code uses standard library functions for directory traversal and filename filtering.",
  "analysis": "The code performs directory traversal with os.walk, filters filenames based on optional 'contains' substring, and extension checks against a predefined set of image types. The functions are straightforward, with no apparent malicious logic or obfuscation. No external inputs are processed insecurely; it simply yields valid image file paths. No network communication, data leakage, or suspicious code behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for listing image files in a directory tree, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
