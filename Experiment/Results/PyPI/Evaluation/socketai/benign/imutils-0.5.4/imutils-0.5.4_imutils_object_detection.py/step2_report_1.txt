  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports agree that the code is a standard implementation of non-maximum suppression (NMS). There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The code processes bounding boxes and optional confidence scores, sorts, and filters overlapping boxes based on IoU threshold. No anomalies, external system calls, or suspicious logic are observed.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is a typical NMS implementation with no security issues. No flaws or logical errors are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and very low or zero security risk scores. These are appropriate given the code's benign nature. The confidence levels are high, reflecting the reviewers' certainty.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since the code is purely a standard algorithm with no malicious or suspicious behavior, there is no justification for high risk scores. The highest risk score here is 0.1, which is still very low and acceptable.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious intent or behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   No claims are made that are based on unfounded assumptions. The analysis is straightforward, based on the code's logic and typical usage.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's nature. No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — The code is benign, implementing a common computer vision technique.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — No obfuscation present.\n- **Risk Score**: 0.1 — Very low, primarily because the code could potentially be misused if integrated into a malicious pipeline, but as-is, it is safe.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- While the code itself is safe, in a real-world scenario, the context of how this code is integrated into a larger system could influence security considerations. However, based solely on this snippet, no risks are present.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe code is a standard, well-understood implementation of non-maximum suppression with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned are appropriate, and there is no need for adjustment.",
