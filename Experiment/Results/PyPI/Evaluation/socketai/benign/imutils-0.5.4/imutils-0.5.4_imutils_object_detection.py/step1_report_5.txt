  "purpose": "Implement non-maximum suppression for bounding box filtering in object detection.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'boxes' and optional 'probs' provide data; the function reads bounding box coordinates and probabilities.",
  "sinks": "Returns filtered bounding boxes; no other sinks such as network, disk, or environment variables are used.",
  "flows": "Input 'boxes' and optionally 'probs' flow through sorting, selection, and overlap calculation to produce filtered boxes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code follows standard non-max suppression algorithm with no suspicious modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard non-maximum suppression: it converts integer coordinates to float, sorts indices based on probabilities or coordinates, iteratively selects boxes with highest confidence, calculates overlap, and suppresses overlapping boxes exceeding a threshold. No hardcoded credentials, network calls, or obfuscated patterns are present. Usage of NumPy is typical for performance. The logic is straightforward and aligns with common implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a standard non-maximum suppression algorithm with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate part of an object detection pipeline.",
