{
  "purpose": "Performs non-maximum suppression on bounding boxes, likely for object detection post-processing.",
  "sources": "Reads bounding boxes and optional probability scores as input parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leaks or external effects; the code primarily processes data internally.",
  "flows": "Input bounding boxes and probabilities are sorted, processed, and filtered based on overlap thresholds.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. Uses standard numpy operations for image processing.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard non-maximum suppression algorithm for bounding boxes. It checks for empty input, converts data types if necessary, sorts boxes by probabilities or coordinates, and iteratively suppresses overlapping boxes based on a threshold. It uses numpy for array operations and index management. No external network activity, obfuscated code, or malicious logic is present. The code appears to be a typical implementation of a common computer vision technique.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of non-max suppression, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It processes data internally without external interactions or sensitive data handling.",
