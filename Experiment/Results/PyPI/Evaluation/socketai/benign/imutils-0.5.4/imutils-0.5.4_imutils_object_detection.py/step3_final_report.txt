  "purpose": "Implementation of non-maximum suppression (NMS) for object detection post-processing.",
  "sources": "Input bounding boxes and optional confidence probabilities.",
  "sinks": "Filtered bounding boxes returned; no external data or system calls.",
  "flows": "Input boxes and probs are sorted; overlapping boxes are suppressed based on IoU threshold; final boxes are returned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-known implementation of NMS using numpy. It processes input boxes and optional probabilities, sorts indices, iteratively selects the highest scoring box, computes overlaps, and suppresses overlapping boxes above a threshold. No external system calls, obfuscation, or malicious logic are present. The implementation is correct and straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of non-max suppression with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals indicate a safe, transparent algorithm suitable for object detection pipelines.",
