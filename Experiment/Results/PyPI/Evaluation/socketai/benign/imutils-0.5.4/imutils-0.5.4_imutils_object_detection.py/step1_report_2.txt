{
  "purpose": "This code performs non-maximum suppression on bounding boxes, typically used in object detection to filter overlapping boxes based on confidence scores or spatial overlap.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'boxes' (bounding box coordinates), 'probs' (optional confidence scores), and 'overlapThresh' (overlap threshold).",
  "sinks": "The function returns filtered bounding boxes; no sinks process untrusted data beyond the input/output context.",
  "flows": "Input 'boxes' and 'probs' flow into sorting and filtering logic, resulting in filtered bounding boxes returned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior. The code appears standard for object detection post-processing.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly implements non-maximum suppression using numpy operations. It includes checks for empty input, type conversions, sorting based on confidence or spatial data, and iterative suppression of overlapping boxes. There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The code does not perform any network communication, file operations, or system modifications. The code logic is consistent with standard algorithms, and there are no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of non-maximum suppression for object detection. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks within this code segment.",
