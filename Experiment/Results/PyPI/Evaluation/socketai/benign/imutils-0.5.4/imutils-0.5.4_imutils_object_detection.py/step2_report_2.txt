  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The code is a standard implementation of non-max suppression with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None identified.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — reasonable.\n- **Justification:** The report correctly identifies the code as benign, standard, and safe.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The logic and implementation are standard.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious activity or vulnerabilities are claimed or observed.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The code remains a typical non-max suppression implementation.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — the securityRisk score is slightly above zero, but the reasoning is that the code is benign.\n- **Justification:** Given the absence of malicious behavior, the small securityRisk score seems slightly overestimated; it should likely be 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The implementation is standard.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n- **Justification:** No security concerns or malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues Present?** No.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — justified.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Recommendations:\n\n- All reports correctly identify the code as a standard, benign implementation of non-max suppression.\n- The malware score is consistently 0, which is appropriate.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, aligning with the lack of obfuscation.\n- The securityRisk score in Report 3 is slightly elevated at 0.1, but since the code is benign, it should be lowered to 0 for consistency.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a straightforward, well-known implementation of non-max suppression with no security issues or malicious intent.",
