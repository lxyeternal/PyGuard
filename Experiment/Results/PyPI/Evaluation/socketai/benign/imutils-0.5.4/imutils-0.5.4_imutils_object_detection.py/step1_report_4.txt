  "purpose": "Implementation of Non-Max Suppression algorithm for bounding box filtering in object detection.",
  "sources": "Inputs: 'boxes' (bounding box coordinates), 'probs' (optional probability scores), 'overlapThresh' (threshold for overlap).",
  "sinks": "The code processes 'boxes' and 'probs' internally; no external or untrusted data sources or sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input 'boxes' and optional 'probs' flow through sorting, comparison, and filtering logic, resulting in filtered bounding boxes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code segments, no hardcoded credentials or secrets, no dynamic code execution or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard non-max suppression logic, converting inputs to float if necessary, sorting based on probabilities or coordinates, and iteratively suppressing overlapping boxes. The logic appears correct and typical for this purpose. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation. Usage of numpy functions aligns with typical image processing pipelines. No suspicious side-effects or hidden actions are present.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a straightforward implementation of non-max suppression for object detection. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard, functional component with no apparent vulnerabilities or sabotage elements.",
