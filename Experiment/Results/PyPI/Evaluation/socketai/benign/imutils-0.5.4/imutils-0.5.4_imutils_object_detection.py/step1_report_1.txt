{
  "purpose": "This code performs non-maximum suppression on bounding boxes, likely used in object detection tasks to filter overlapping detections.",
  "sources": "Reads input bounding boxes and optional probabilities (probs), from function parameters; uses numpy for array operations.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks; the code processes data internally and returns filtered bounding boxes without external data leaks or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input bounding boxes and probabilities flow into the suppression logic; selected boxes are output. No untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures observed. The code implements standard non-max suppression logic; no obfuscation or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports numpy, defines a function for non-maximum suppression, and processes input bounding boxes with optional probabilities. It sorts boxes based on probabilities or bottom-left y-coordinates, then iteratively selects boxes and suppresses overlapping ones based on an IoU threshold. No external system calls, data exfiltration, or malicious operations are present. All operations are typical for object detection post-processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of non-maximum suppression used in object detection pipelines. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious anomalies, and uses common coding practices. There is no evidence of malware or security risks.",
