  "purpose": "Module setup for an image processing library, defining version and importing utility functions.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (.convenience and .meta).",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no external data or network communication occurs in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows; only imports and version assignment without execution.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward and standard for a package initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string and imports various utility functions from internal modules, typical for an __init__.py or module setup. No code execution, data handling, or external communication is present. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are evident. The functions imported relate to image processing and version checking, with no indication of malicious intent. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0 and low security risks. Slight overestimation of security risk scores (e.g., 0.2) can be adjusted to 0, as the code does not process or transmit data. Overall, the code is a standard, safe module setup with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments in the reports are accurate; only minor adjustments to the security risk score are recommended to reflect the true safety of this code snippet.",
