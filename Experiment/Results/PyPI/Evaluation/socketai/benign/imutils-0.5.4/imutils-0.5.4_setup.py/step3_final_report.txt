{
  "purpose": "This setup script defines package metadata and configuration for the 'imutils' Python library, listing packages, scripts, URLs, and author info.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata, package list, and external script 'bin/range-detector' specified for installation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data processing within this script; the only external component is the listed script 'bin/range-detector'.",
  "flows": "No data flows or dynamic execution within the setup script; external script 'bin/range-detector' may be executed during installation, but this is outside the scope of this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and standard for Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard static setup configuration with no dynamic or malicious behavior. The only external component ('bin/range-detector') could pose a risk if malicious, but this cannot be determined from setup.py alone. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. The malware score is zero, and the risk score should be minimal, reflecting the external script concern but not the setup code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign and standard, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The only potential concern is the external script 'bin/range-detector', which should be reviewed separately. Based solely on this code, the malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and the security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2).",
