  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** Correctly identifies that the code is a straightforward setup script with no dynamic or malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.5 (as per the report, it's 0).  \n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Also correctly notes the script is a standard setup, with the only potential concern being the 'bin/range-detector' script.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.  \n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. The script is external, so without its content, no malicious activity can be confirmed.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to above, notes the 'bin/range-detector' script as a potential vector but finds no malicious code in the setup script itself.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.  \n- **Assessment:** Reasonable. The slight increase in risk accounts for the external script.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as above, emphasizes that the setup script is benign but the external script could be malicious.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.  \n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Confirms the script is standard, with no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Review and Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code being a typical setup script. No malicious code or backdoors are present in the provided code snippet. The only external concern is the 'bin/range-detector' script, which is external and not part of this code. Since we cannot evaluate its content, the malware score should remain at 0.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly identify the code as straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code (a standard setup script), the risk is minimal. The only potential concern is the external script, but without evidence of maliciousness, the risk score should be low, around 0.1-0.2, as reflected in the reports.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The setup script is purely static, with no dynamic code, no external data fetching, no obfuscated code, and no hardcoded secrets.\n- The external script 'bin/range-detector' could be a vector if malicious, but since its content is unknown and the setup code itself is benign, the risk score should stay low.\n- The malware score remains at 0 because there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Estimated Value | Justification                                              |\n|------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                       | No malicious code detected; external script unknown.        |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                       | Clear, straightforward setup script.                         |\n| Risk             | 0.1 - 0.2               | Slight potential concern due to external script, but no evidence. |\n\n**Overall, the code appears safe and legitimate.**",
