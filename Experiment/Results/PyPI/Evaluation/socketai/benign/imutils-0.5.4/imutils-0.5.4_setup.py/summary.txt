  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign and standard, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The only potential concern is the external script 'bin/range-detector', which should be reviewed separately. Based solely on this code, the malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and the security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2)."
