{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for sorting and labeling contours in images using OpenCV, primarily for image processing and computer vision tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads image data indirectly through OpenCV functions such as cv2.boundingRect, cv2.moments, cv2.drawContours, and cv2.putText.",
  "sinks": "Image modification functions such as cv2.drawContours and cv2.putText act as sinks where image data is altered; no untrusted data or user input directly influences these functions, but they process image data derived from input images.",
  "flows": "Contours are input to 'sort_contours', which processes bounding boxes; labeled contours are drawn on the image in 'label_contour'. The data flow is from input image contours to annotated output images.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior. The code performs standard image processing operations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports OpenCV, a widely used computer vision library, and defines functions for sorting contours based on spatial position and labeling them visually on images. The 'sort_contours' function sorts contours by position (left-to-right, top-to-bottom, etc.) using bounding box coordinates. The 'label_contour' function calculates the centroid of each contour and labels it with an index on the image. All functions use standard OpenCV methods with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected. There are no indications of malicious data handling, code injection, or unauthorized system access.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is standard image processing code utilizing OpenCV functions for contour sorting and labeling. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks present in this code. It appears to be legitimate, well-structured image analysis code with no malicious intent.",
