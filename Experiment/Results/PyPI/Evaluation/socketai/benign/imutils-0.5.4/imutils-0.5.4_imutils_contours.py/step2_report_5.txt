  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code to assess the security implications.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Provides utility functions for sorting contours (`sort_contours`) based on spatial methods.\n- Labels contours on images (`label_contour`) by computing their centroid and drawing annotations.\n- Uses standard OpenCV functions (`cv2.boundingRect`, `cv2.moments`, `cv2.drawContours`, `cv2.putText`).\n- No network activity, no file I/O, no external data handling, no obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets.\n- Purpose appears to be image annotation in CV workflows.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  No, all reports conclude that the code is benign, standard image processing code with no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning?**  \n  The reports are consistent and thorough, correctly identifying that the code is straightforward, uses standard functions, and lacks suspicious behaviors.\n\n- **Scores assigned to malware, obfuscated, security risk?**  \n  All reports assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5?**  \n  None of the reports assign high risk scores; all are 0 or 1 confidence with no malware or security risk.\n\n- **Malware score considerations:**  \n  Since the code performs only image annotation with standard functions, malware score should be 0.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No, all reports base their conclusions on code analysis, not assumptions.\n\n- **Consistency of scores with the report?**  \n  Yes, consistent across all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The code is purely image annotation, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- No obfuscation, no external data handling, no network communication.\n- All functions rely on standard, well-known OpenCV functions.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese scores reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my own estimate:**\n\n| Score Type      | Justification                                                                                     |\n|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0 — No malicious activity or code behavior detected.                                           |\n| Obfuscated      | 0 — Clear, readable code with standard functions.                                                 |\n| Security risk   | 0 — No vulnerabilities, no external data handling, no network activity.                        |\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard utility for image contour sorting and labeling, with no security risks.**",
