{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for sorting image contours and labeling them for visualization purposes, likely used in image processing or computer vision tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads image data via the 'cv2' library functions such as cv2.boundingRect, cv2.drawContours, and cv2.putText, as well as contour data passed into functions.",
  "sinks": "The code writes visual output directly onto an image object, which can be displayed or saved, but it does not involve network transmission, file writing, or data exfiltration within this snippet.",
  "flows": "Contours and images are input into functions; image modifications are made (drawing contours and labels), but no untrusted data is sent outside the environment; no flow to network or storage is present.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors. The code relies solely on standard OpenCV functions for image processing.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, utilizing standard OpenCV methods for contour sorting and labeling. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious code, such as data exfiltration, network access, or system manipulation. The functions perform image annotations, a common task in CV workflows, without any side effects outside image modification.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, focused on image processing tasks without any malicious intent. It is standard image annotation code with no signs of malware or security risks.",
