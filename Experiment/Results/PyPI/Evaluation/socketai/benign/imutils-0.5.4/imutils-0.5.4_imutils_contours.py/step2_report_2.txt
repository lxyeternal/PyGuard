  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Defines two functions:\n  - `sort_contours`: sorts contours based on specified method (left-to-right, right-to-left, top-to-bottom, bottom-to-top).\n  - `label_contour`: computes the centroid of a contour and labels it on the image.\n- Uses standard OpenCV functions (`cv2.boundingRect`, `cv2.moments`, `cv2.drawContours`, `cv2.putText`).\n- No external network, file I/O, or data exfiltration.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming Issues in the Code:\n- **Presence of malicious code or vulnerabilities?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward, standard OpenCV image annotation utilities.\n- **Code correctness?**  \n  Functionality appears correct for sorting and labeling contours.\n- **Potential security issues?**  \n  No evident security issues or malicious intent.\n\n### Review of the Reports:\nAll five reports uniformly state:\n- The code is standard, benign, and uses OpenCV for image annotation.\n- No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malware.\n- No external data flow or network activity.\n- The functions perform legitimate tasks in image processing.\n\n**Scores assigned:**\n- `malware`: 0 in all reports.\n- `obfuscated`: 0 in all reports.\n- `securityRisk`: 0 in all reports.\n- `confidence`: 1 (or 1.0).\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  Yes. Given the code's simplicity and standard library usage, a malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0 are appropriate.\n- **Are the conclusions justified?**  \n  Yes. All reports agree that the code is benign and typical for image annotation.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies:\n- None observed. The reports are consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe code performs basic image processing tasks with no suspicious behavior, no external data handling, and uses standard libraries. The reported functions are common in computer vision workflows and do not pose security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The reports are accurate and align with the code's functionality.\n- No changes to scores are necessary.\n- The code is benign, with no malware or obfuscation.\n- The overall security risk is negligible.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: **malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0**.",
