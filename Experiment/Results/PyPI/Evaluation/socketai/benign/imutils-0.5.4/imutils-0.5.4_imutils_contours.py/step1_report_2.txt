{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for sorting and labeling contours in images using OpenCV.",
  "sources": "Imports cv2 library, which is used for image processing.",
  "sinks": "Uses cv2 functions that process image data, but does not involve untrusted input handling or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Reads image data via cv2 functions, processes contours, computes moments, and draws annotations on images.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors detected. No obfuscated code, no network activity, and no system manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for image contour processing: sorting contours and labeling them. It uses OpenCV's standard functions for image analysis and annotation without any network communication, data leaks, or system modification. No suspicious logic, external data handling, or security-critical vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward image processing utility with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It functions solely to manipulate and annotate images using OpenCV, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
