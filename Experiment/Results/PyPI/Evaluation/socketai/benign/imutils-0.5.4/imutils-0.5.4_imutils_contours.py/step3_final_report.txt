  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for sorting contours based on spatial position and labeling contours with their centroid on images using OpenCV.",
  "sources": "cv2.boundingRect, cv2.moments, user-provided contours, image data for drawing and text placement",
  "sinks": "cv2.drawContours, cv2.putText, image display or storage (if used outside this code fragment)",
  "flows": "Contours are processed to compute bounding boxes and moments, then labeled on the image with drawing functions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code uses standard OpenCV functions without obfuscation or suspicious logic",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard OpenCV functions for contour sorting and labeling, with no network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code. It performs typical image annotation tasks. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. The functions are straightforward and well-structured, indicating benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for contour sorting and labeling in image processing workflows. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All evidence supports a malware score of 0, security risk of 0, and high confidence in benign classification.",
