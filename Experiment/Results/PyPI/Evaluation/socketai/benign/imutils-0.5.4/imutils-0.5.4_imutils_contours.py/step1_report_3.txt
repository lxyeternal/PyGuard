{
  "purpose": "The code is designed for processing and labeling contours in an image, primarily for image analysis and computer vision tasks.",
  "sources": "Reads image data through the cv2 library functions, particularly from contours provided as input to label_contour.",
  "sinks": "Draws on and modifies the provided image object using cv2 drawing functions.",
  "flows": "Input contours and image data are processed to sort contours and label them visually on the image, with data flowing from input parameters through processing functions to visual output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. The code uses standard OpenCV functions for image processing. No obfuscated code, no data exfiltration, or malicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports OpenCV and provides functions for sorting contours based on specified methods and labeling them with indices on images. The sort_contours function sorts contours by their bounding box coordinates, while label_contour calculates the centroid of a contour and labels it on the image. Both functions utilize standard OpenCV methods for image analysis and visualization, with no external network communication or suspicious data handling. No hardcoded secrets or potentially malicious operations are present. The code appears to be a legitimate utility for contour processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard image processing utility for sorting and labeling contours. It contains no malicious or suspicious behaviors. It performs visual annotation tasks using OpenCV functions without any indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
