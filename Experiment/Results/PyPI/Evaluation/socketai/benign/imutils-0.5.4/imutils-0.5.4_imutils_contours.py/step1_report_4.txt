{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for sorting contours and labeling them on an image, primarily for image processing and computer vision tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads contour data and image data, especially from cv2 functions like cv2.boundingRect, cv2.moments, cv2.drawContours, and cv2.putText.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the cv2 drawing functions that modify images; no untrusted data is directly written or transmitted externally.",
  "flows": "Contours and image data are processed internally: contours are sorted based on bounding box coordinates, and labels are drawn on the image based on contour calculations.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual dynamic code execution, or suspicious behaviors. The code utilizes standard OpenCV functions with clear purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with standard imports and function definitions. The 'sort_contours' function sorts contour data based on specified methods, using standard sorting and bounding box calculations. The 'label_contour' function computes the centroid of contours and annotates images accordingly. All functions rely solely on OpenCV library calls, which are typical in image processing tasks. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code performs legitimate image annotation functions without any suspicious behavior or external data transmission.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is legitimate image processing code for sorting and labeling contours. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a standard implementation for visual annotation tasks in computer vision projects.",
