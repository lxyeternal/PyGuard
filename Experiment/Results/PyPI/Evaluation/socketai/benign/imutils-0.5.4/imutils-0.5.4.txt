      "conclusion": "The setup script is benign and standard, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The only potential concern is the external script 'bin/range-detector', which should be reviewed separately. Based solely on this code, the malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and the security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2)."

The only issue is the deprecated 'base64.decodestring()', which should be replaced with 'base64.b64decode()' for compatibility. The overall security risk score is minimal (0.1), and malware score is zero, reflecting no malicious activity."

The only potential concern is the use of external URLs for image download, which is a common practice and not inherently risky. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and justified based on the analysis."
