{
  "purpose": "This code manages deprecation warnings and imports for configuration classes and operations related to a data build tool (dbt) plugin, maintaining the public API surface.",
  "sources": "The code reads static modules and configuration classes, primarily through import statements and the warnings module.",
  "targets": "There are no explicit untrusted data sources or user inputs in this code that could be exploited; it mainly loads modules and issues a deprecation warning.",
  "flows": "N/A - The code primarily involves static imports and conditional imports based on exceptions; no dynamic data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional imports based on custom exceptions are present, but they serve normal configuration management purposes. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code issues a deprecation warning about a package component, then imports several configuration and operation classes, with some conditional imports depending on whether certain modules are available. All imported items are re-exported for public API exposure. No untrusted input, data flow, or malicious patterns are identified. The structure is typical for a Python package module responsible for managing configurations and exposing API components. No obfuscated code or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module for managing deprecation notices and module imports, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It primarily serves as an API surface definition with conditional module loading, which is common in configurable Python packages.",
