  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes deprecation warning and static module imports.\n- **Targets & Flows:** No untrusted data or dynamic data flows.\n- **Anomalies:** Standard conditional imports based on exceptions.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The code's purpose is to manage API exposure and handle deprecation.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard module setup.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on deprecation and module imports.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks or external code execution.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of try-except for optional dependencies is common.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious patterns; code is straightforward.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard API module configuration.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Manages deprecation warnings, imports, and API exposure.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or code execution.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious constructs; exception handling for optional modules is typical.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, typical setup code.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar pattern—warnings, imports, optional dependencies.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or external system interactions.\n- **Anomalies:** Standard handling of optional dependencies.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Very low security risk, standard practice.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as others—deprecation warning, static imports, optional dependencies.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks or malicious activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code.\n- **Analysis:** Typical library setup.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, no risks.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** The code does not contain any malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscated segments.\n- **Errors or Flaws in Logic:** The logic for handling deprecation warnings and optional dependencies is standard and correct.\n- **Scores Justification:**\n  - **Malware:** 0 in all reports, consistent with the analysis.\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n  - **Risk Score:** All reports assign very low or zero risk, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- **Potential Risks & Assumptions:** The only assumptions are that optional dependencies are correctly handled and that no malicious code is hidden in the modules being imported. Given the static nature of the code and the absence of external input processing, these are reasonable.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the lack of any malicious or suspicious activity, a risk score of approximately 0.0–0.1 is appropriate.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, well-structured module for managing deprecation warnings and API exports. No security issues or malicious behaviors are evident. The current scores are justified and should remain unchanged.\n\n---\n\n**Final Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect minimal, non-malicious complexity, if any)\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a more conservative or aggressive scoring approach.",
