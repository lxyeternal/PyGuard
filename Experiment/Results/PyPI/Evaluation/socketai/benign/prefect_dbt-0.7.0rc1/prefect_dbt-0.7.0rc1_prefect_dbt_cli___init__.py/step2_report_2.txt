  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes standard module setup with deprecation warning and static imports.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No dynamic data flow, no suspicious code.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The deprecation warning is benign.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is a typical API module with no security issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.5 (originally 0), which seems appropriate given the benign nature but a slight risk due to deprecation notices possibly leading to outdated dependencies.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, with standard imports and deprecation warning.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** Standard exception handling for optional dependencies.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, just standard package setup.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, benign code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.5 (originally 1). Since the original report assigned a perfect 1, but the code is benign, a lower score is justified.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern—deprecation warning, static imports, optional dependencies.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No external input, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard setup.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.5 (originally 0.9). Again, the code is benign, so a lower score is warranted.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, with deprecation warning and conditional imports.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No suspicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious intent, just standard dependency management.\n- **Conclusion:** Very low security risk.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 (originally 0.95). The original high score seems unjustified; the code is benign.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern—deprecation warning, static imports, optional dependencies.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No malicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** Standard API setup.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.0 (originally 1). The original score overstates the risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code. **Final malware score: 0.0**\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected. **Final obfuscated score: 0.0**\n- **Risk Score:** The original reports assigned high risk scores (up to 1), but the code is purely for deprecation warnings and module imports, with no external data processing, no code injection, or malicious behavior. The only potential concern is that deprecation warnings could lead users to outdated dependencies, but this is a common practice and not inherently risky.\n\n**Therefore, a more accurate risk score would be very low, around 0.0 to 0.1.** Given the context, I recommend:\n\n- **Final Risk Score: 0.0** — the code is standard, benign, and poses no security threat.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a typical Python module managing deprecation notices and conditional imports.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The high scores assigned in the reports are unjustified based on the code's content.\n- The minimal potential risk is related to deprecation handling, which is standard and not security-critical.\n\n**Final recommendations:**  \n- Keep malware and obfuscated scores at **0.0**.  \n- Set overall security risk to **0.0** or very close to it, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Summary:**  \n**Malware Score:** 0.0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0.0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.0\n\nThis assessment aligns with the code's straightforward, well-understood purpose and implementation.",
