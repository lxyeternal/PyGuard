{
  "purpose": "This code manages warnings and imports specific configuration classes and operations for a data build tool (dbt) plugin or module, and re-exports them for public use.",
  "sources": "Code reads no external inputs; it only imports internal modules and handles warnings.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks are present; the code does not write data or execute untrusted commands.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing modules, issuing a warning, and handling optional imports with exception handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are present. The warnings are standard deprecation notices.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily issues a deprecation warning about a module and manages conditional imports based on exceptions related to missing dependencies. It re-exports modules to define a public API. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code. The handling of optional dependencies appears standard, with exception suppression for missing modules, which is common in optional feature implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup with deprecation warning handling and conditional imports. It does not contain malicious intent or security risks. The overall security risk is very low, with no evidence of malware or suspicious activity.",
