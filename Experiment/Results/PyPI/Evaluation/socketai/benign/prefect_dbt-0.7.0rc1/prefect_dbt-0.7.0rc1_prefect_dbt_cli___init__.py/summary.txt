  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign module for managing deprecation notices and API exposure. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The high scores assigned in some reports are unjustified; the malware and obfuscated scores should be 0, and the overall security risk is negligible."
