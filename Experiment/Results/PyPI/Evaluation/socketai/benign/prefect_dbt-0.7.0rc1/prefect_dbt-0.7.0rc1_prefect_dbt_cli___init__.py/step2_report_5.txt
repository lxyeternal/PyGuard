  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is primarily concerned with issuing a deprecation warning, importing various configuration classes, and handling optional dependencies via try-except blocks.\n- No dynamic data processing, user input, or external data sources are involved.\n- No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- The only potentially \"suspicious\" aspect is the use of try-except for optional dependencies, which is standard practice.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identified as managing deprecation warnings and static imports.\n- **Targets & Flows:** No untrusted data or data flow; static imports.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is standard, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code is benign. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above; deprecation warning, static imports.\n- **Targets & Flows:** No data leaks or external inputs.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of try-except for optional dependencies is normal.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard API setup, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct reasoning; scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, managing deprecation warnings and static imports.\n- **Targets & Flows:** No untrusted data or external inputs.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is straightforward, standard for library setup.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Reasoning is valid; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern, deprecation warning, static imports.\n- **Targets & Flows:** No data leaks or malicious activity.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of try-except for optional dependencies is common.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Note:** The security risk score is slightly above zero, but given the benign nature, this is acceptable. The malware score remains zero.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above; deprecation and conditional imports.\n- **Targets & Flows:** No external data or untrusted inputs.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard API setup, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Conclusion:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code is purely for managing deprecation warnings and module imports.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** None of the reports find obfuscation; this is accurate.\n- **Risk Score:** The risk is very low; some reports assign 0, one assigns 0.1, which is acceptable given the context.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code present.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0 — standard library code with no external attack vectors.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:**\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, with no security concerns. The small deviation in the security risk score (0.1) in one report is acceptable, given the use of exception handling for optional dependencies, which is common.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score |\n|----------------|-------------------|------------|\n| 0              | 0                 | 0          |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
