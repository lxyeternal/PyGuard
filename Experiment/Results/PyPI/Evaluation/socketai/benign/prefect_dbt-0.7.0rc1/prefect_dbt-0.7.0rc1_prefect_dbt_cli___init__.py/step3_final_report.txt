{
  "purpose": "Manage deprecation warnings and expose API classes for a Python package, with conditional imports for optional dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static import statements, warnings.warn call, try-except blocks for optional modules",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data sources; no external system interactions",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; static imports and warning issuance only",
  "anomalies": "None; standard handling of optional dependencies with try-except",
  "analysis": "The code issues a deprecation warning, imports core classes and optional configurations wrapped in try-except, and re-exports them via __all__. No dynamic code execution, no user input, no network activity, and no suspicious constructs are present. The structure and purpose are typical for a package setup module. No malicious or obfuscated code detected; the code is benign and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign module for managing deprecation notices and API exposure. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The high scores assigned in some reports are unjustified; the malware and obfuscated scores should be 0, and the overall security risk is negligible.",
