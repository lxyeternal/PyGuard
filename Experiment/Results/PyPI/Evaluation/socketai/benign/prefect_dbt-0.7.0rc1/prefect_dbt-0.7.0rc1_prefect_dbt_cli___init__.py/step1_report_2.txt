{
  "purpose": "This code manages deprecation warnings, imports specific configuration classes and operations for a data build tool (dbt) integration, and re-exports them as part of the public API.",
  "sources": "Warnings module for deprecation message, local module imports, conditional imports based on exception handling.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or code execution; no network or file system operations; no sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Deprecation warning flow; import flows for configuration classes; conditional import flow based on exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except to conditionally import configurations suggests optional dependencies; no suspicious code execution or obfuscation detected; no hardcoded credentials or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code issues a deprecation warning for an old module, encourages migration to a new one, then imports and re-exports configuration classes for various cloud providers. The try-except blocks handle optional dependencies, which is standard practice. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code is straightforward, mainly for module setup and API exposure.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, benign module setup for a Python package. No malicious intent, malware, or security risks are evident. It handles deprecation notices, imports configuration classes, and manages optional dependencies securely.",
