  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code is a standard, auto-generated version info module for a Python package.\n- It contains no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no suspicious patterns.\n- All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the code's presence of issues:\n- The code is straightforward, with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- No untrusted data, no code injection, no hardcoded credentials, and no external data handling.\n- The version info is static, assigned directly from hardcoded strings and tuples.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**No issues are present in the code.**\n\n---\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- They correctly identify the code as benign, auto-generated, and non-malicious.\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n**Note:**  \nAll reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** all reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Obfuscated score:** all assign 0, appropriate given the code clarity.\n- **Security risk score:** all assign 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n**Suggestion:**  \nScores seem reasonable; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- Since the code is purely static, auto-generated version info with no external inputs or execution, the risk scores are correctly set to 0.\n- Any higher score would be unjustified.\n\n---\n\n### Challenging claims based on assumptions:\n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n- No suspicious patterns or behaviors are claimed or implied.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate after review:\nGiven the code's simplicity and the reports' accuracy, I agree with their assessments.\n\n**Final scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis is a standard, auto-generated version info file with no malicious or risky behavior. All scores should remain at zero.",
