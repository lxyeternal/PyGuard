  "purpose": "Define version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, to track package versioning without tracking in version control.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string and version tuple variables, and conditional import based on TYPE_CHECKING.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or potential data leaks identified; no sinks that could lead to security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "The version string and tuple are assigned directly; no untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; code is straightforward, standard for version management.",
  "analysis": "The code simply defines version variables for a package, with a conditional import for type checking. It assigns a static version string and tuple, and does not perform any operations that involve external inputs or potentially malicious behavior. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard snippet used for package versioning, with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
