  "purpose": "Define version information and type checking behavior for a Python package generated by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'version' string and assigns it to multiple variables.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive actions.",
  "flows": "The version string is assigned to variables; no untrusted data flow or external data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and standard for version management.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up version information with a conditional for type checking, assigning a version string and tuple. There are no external inputs, no code execution, no data leaks, nor any suspicious patterns. It is a standard auto-generated file for versioning purposes, with no malicious intent or malicious behavior evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated version information file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
