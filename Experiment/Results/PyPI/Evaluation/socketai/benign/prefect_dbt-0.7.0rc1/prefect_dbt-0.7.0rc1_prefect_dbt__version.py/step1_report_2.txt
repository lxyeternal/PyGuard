{
  "purpose": "This code defines versioning information for a Python package, generated automatically by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "The version string '__version__' and '__version_tuple__' assigned directly in the code.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no data is written to external systems or used in potentially dangerous operations.",
  "flows": "The version information is assigned from hardcoded values to variables, with no external input or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains generated version info with no user input, no hardcoded credentials, and no malicious or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, generated module defining version constants. It uses conditional typing imports and assigns version info statically. There are no sources of untrusted data, no data flows to sinks, and no suspicious constructs. The code serves a simple, non-malicious purpose of version representation, with no obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only as a version info holder for the package. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
