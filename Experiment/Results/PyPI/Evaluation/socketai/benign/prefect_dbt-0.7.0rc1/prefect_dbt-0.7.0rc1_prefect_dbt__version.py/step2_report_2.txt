  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims, scores, and underlying logic.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward, auto-generated version info module.\n- No external inputs, no data flows from untrusted sources, no dynamic code execution.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The code is static, simple, and standard for version management.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Logical Checks:\n\n**Does the code contain any malicious or suspicious behavior?**  \n- No. The code merely defines version variables with hardcoded values and conditional type checking imports.  \n- No external data, no network activity, no code injection, no obfuscation.\n\n**Are the scores reasonable?**  \n- Malware score: 0 across all reports. This is consistent with the code's benign nature.  \n- Obfuscated: 0, also consistent.  \n- Security risk: 0, as no vulnerabilities or malicious activities are present.\n\n**Are any scores unreasonable?**  \n- No. All scores align with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n1. **Presence of issues or vulnerabilities:**  \n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is benign, with no issues present.\n\n2. **Errors or flaws in reasoning:**  \n   - No errors detected. The reasoning is sound and consistent.\n\n3. **Claims about potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n   - No such claims are made; the reports are cautious and accurate.\n\n4. **Any inconsistencies or unreasonable scores?**  \n   - All scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- The code is a standard, auto-generated version info snippet.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-sensitive behavior.\n- The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are justified.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- The code is static, auto-generated, with no external inputs or execution paths that could be exploited.  \n- No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.  \n- The purpose is purely version metadata, which is inherently safe.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate, and their scoring and conclusions are appropriate. The code is benign, with no security concerns.",
