{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, primarily used for version control and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads version string from hardcoded string assignment (__version__ and version variables). No external input sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Hardcoded version string assigned to variables; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Contains no suspicious code or unusual patterns; standard versioning code with conditional type checking.",
  "analysis": "The code sets version metadata for a Python package, including type hints for type checkers. It uses a standard pattern for package versioning with no external data input, no dynamic execution, and no security-sensitive operations. No obfuscated code, no hardcoded credentials, no network operations, and no potentially malicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, benign versioning snippet with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
