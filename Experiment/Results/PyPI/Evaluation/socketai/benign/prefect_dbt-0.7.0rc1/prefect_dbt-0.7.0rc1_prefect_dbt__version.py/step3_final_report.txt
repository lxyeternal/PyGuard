{
  "purpose": "Provides version information for a Python package, auto-generated by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version string and tuple assignments; conditional import for type checking.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs are processed.",
  "flows": "Static assignment of version data; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and auto-generated with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static versioning module with no external inputs, dynamic code execution, or network activity. It uses conditional type checking imports, which are standard. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code. The code's purpose is purely metadata, and it does not perform any operations that could compromise security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, auto-generated version info with no malicious or security issues. The reports correctly identify this, and their scoring is appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
