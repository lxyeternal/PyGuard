{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package generated by setuptools_scm, mainly used for version control and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Constant string assignment for __version__ and version_tuple, type checking conditional import.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows that process untrusted input or could leak data.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; static assignment of version info.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic; the code is straightforward version metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily auto-generated metadata for package versioning. It conditionally imports typing modules based on TYPE_CHECKING, then assigns version information to variables. No user input, external data, or sensitive information is involved. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard versioning snippet, entirely benign, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
