  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The module exposes certain attributes via `__getattr__`.\n- It uses a fixed `_public_api` mapping to determine module paths.\n- When an attribute is accessed, it dynamically imports the corresponding module and retrieves the attribute.\n- Error handling for `ImportError` returns `None` for config modules.\n- No external inputs influence the import paths or attribute access.\n- The code is straightforward, controlled, and designed for API exposure.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code matches the descriptions; no anomalies or suspicious behavior are evident.\n- The dynamic import is controlled via a static mapping.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present.\n- The logic is transparent, and the flow is predictable.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- **None identified.** The code is standard for a plugin or API loader, with proper exception handling.\n\n### Score Review:\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, obfuscation scores of 0, and very low security risk scores (~0.1-0.2). These are reasonable given the controlled nature of the code.\n- The reports' confidence levels are high (0.9), which is appropriate.\n- The potential concern about dynamic import based on attribute names is mitigated by the static `_public_api` mapping.\n\n### Justification for Risk and Malware Scores:\n- **Malware Score (0):** No malicious activity, payload, or backdoors are present.\n- **Obfuscated Score (0):** Code is clear, no obfuscation techniques used.\n- **Security Risk (0.1-0.2):** Minimal, mainly due to dynamic import, but controlled and safe in context.\n\n### Potential Concerns:\n- The only hypothetical risk is if `_public_api` were manipulated externally, but since it's static and internal, this is not a real concern.\n- If attribute names could be influenced by external inputs, there could be a risk, but the current design prevents this.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1 (very low, standard for dynamic import mechanisms, controlled via static mapping)\n\n**Overall, the code is safe, well-structured, and does not pose supply chain security risks.**\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a controlled dynamic attribute loader for a Python package.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and justified.\n- I agree with the overall assessment that the code is safe and does not introduce security risks.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed; the code is secure in its current form.",
