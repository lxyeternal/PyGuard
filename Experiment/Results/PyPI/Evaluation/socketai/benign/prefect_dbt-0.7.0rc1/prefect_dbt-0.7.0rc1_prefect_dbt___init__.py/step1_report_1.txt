{
  "purpose": "This module dynamically imports and exposes specific attributes from submodules, mainly for API purposes and version management.",
  "sources": "The code reads module attributes from local package submodules and from the Python import system (importlib).",
  "sinks": "The dynamic import via importlib.import_module can load external modules based on internal mappings. However, since the module names are fixed and predefined in the _public_api dictionary, there are no untrusted input sources. The getattr call also operates on imported modules and predefined attribute names.",
  "flows": "The code maps attribute names to module paths, then dynamically imports the module and retrieves the attribute. No external user input influences the import paths or attribute retrieval; the flow is fixed and controlled.",
  "anomalies": "There are no signs of code obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code. The dynamic import is controlled via a predefined dictionary, reducing risk. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily manages API exposure by importing specific attributes from submodules when accessed via __getattr__. It uses a fixed mapping for controlled dynamic imports. The code includes error handling for ImportError, which is standard. No external inputs influence the import paths or attribute access, minimizing security risks. The dynamic import is intentionally designed for API convenience, not for malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pattern for exposing module attributes dynamically with controlled import paths. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The logic is transparent and does not involve external inputs that could be exploited. Overall, the code appears safe.",
