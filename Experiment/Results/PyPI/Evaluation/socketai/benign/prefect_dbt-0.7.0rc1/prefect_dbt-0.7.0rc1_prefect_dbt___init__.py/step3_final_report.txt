{
  "purpose": "The code manages dynamic attribute access via __getattr__, importing specific submodules based on a static mapping to expose API components.",
  "sources": "Attribute access triggers __getattr__, which imports modules from predefined package and module paths in _public_api.",
  "sinks": "The dynamic import and getattr result in returning attributes from internal modules; no external data influences this process.",
  "flows": "Attribute name in __getattr__ -> importlib.import_module of specified module -> getattr of attribute -> return.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; static mapping controls import paths; exception handling is standard; no obfuscation or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code uses a static dictionary to control dynamic imports, reducing risk. No external input influences attribute names or import paths. Exception handling for import errors is straightforward. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The pattern is standard for plugin or API exposure modules. The potential risk exists only if attribute names are externally manipulated, which is unlikely given the fixed mapping. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is minimal (~0.1-0.2), justified by the controlled import mechanism.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, controlled dynamic API loader with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; a risk score of around 0.1 is justified due to the dynamic import pattern, but overall, the code is secure and benign.",
