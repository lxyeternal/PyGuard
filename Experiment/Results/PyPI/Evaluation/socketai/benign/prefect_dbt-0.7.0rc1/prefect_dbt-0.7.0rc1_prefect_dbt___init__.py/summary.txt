  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, controlled dynamic API loader with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; a risk score of around 0.1 is justified due to the dynamic import pattern, but overall, the code is secure and benign."
