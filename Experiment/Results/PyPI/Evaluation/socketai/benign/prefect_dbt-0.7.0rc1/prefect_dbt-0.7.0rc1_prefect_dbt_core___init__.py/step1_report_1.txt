{
  "purpose": "The code defines module exports for PrefectDbtRunner and PrefectDbtSettings, likely for use in a larger project.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .runner and .settings",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flows, as the code only contains import and export statements",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior observed; only standard module import/export syntax",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward imports and sets the __all__ variable for module exports. It does not process or handle untrusted input, nor does it contain dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials, or any suspicious behavior. The structure is minimal and typical for Python modules, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple, benign module definition with no malicious behavior or security issues detected.",
