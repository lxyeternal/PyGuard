  "purpose": "Module setup for exporting PrefectDbt classes",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.runner and .settings)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks",
  "flows": "Import classes -> define __all__ for exports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import/export pattern",
  "analysis": "The code imports two classes from local modules and declares them as public exports via __all__. It contains no dynamic code, no input/output handling, no network activity, and no suspicious constructs. The code is minimal, standard for Python modules, and exhibits no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident, and the high confidence scores are justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate and should remain as-is.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
