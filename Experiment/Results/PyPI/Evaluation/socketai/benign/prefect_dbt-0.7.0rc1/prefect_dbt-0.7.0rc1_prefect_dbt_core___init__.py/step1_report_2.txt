  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package module, primarily importing classes from local modules and defining exported symbols.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: '.runner' and '.settings'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted input or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports and symbol exports.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no suspicious or unusual constructs. No hardcoded secrets or dynamic code execution are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two classes from local modules, 'PrefectDbtRunner' and 'PrefectDbtSettings', and defines the __all__ list for module exports. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It is a typical module initialization pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard import and export functions with no malicious intent or security risks.",
