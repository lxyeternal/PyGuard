  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Review:**\nThe provided code is straightforward:\n```python\nfrom .runner import PrefectDbtRunner\nfrom .settings import PrefectDbtSettings\n\n__all__ = [\"PrefectDbtRunner\", \"PrefectDbtSettings\"]\n```\nIt simply imports two classes from local modules and declares them as public exports via `__all__`. There are no dynamic behaviors, no input/output handling, no network activity, and no suspicious constructs.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  No, the code is benign and standard for Python module setup.\n\n---\n\n### Flaws, Errors, or Mistakes:\n- **Logical or security flaws?**  \n  None. The code is minimal and performs a common pattern.\n\n---\n\n### Scores and their appropriateness:\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports score 0 or 0.0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n- **Malware:** All reports score 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- **Security Risk:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n\n**However,** the scores are uniformly low, which matches the code's benign nature. There are no issues to escalate.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- Since all reports indicate no malicious or suspicious activity, raising the malware or risk scores would be unjustified.\n- The code is not obfuscated, does not contain malicious logic, and has no security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency and reasoning:\n- The reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n- No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities or malicious intent beyond what the code shows.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on the code and reports, I agree with the current scores:**\n\n| Score Type      | Value | Justification                                              |\n|-----------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| malware         | 0       | No malicious behavior or code present.                       |\n| obfuscated      | 0       | Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.             |\n| securityRisk    | 0       | No vulnerabilities or risky behaviors detected.             |\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\nGiven the complete review, I would assign:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, and the scores should remain at zero across all categories. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
