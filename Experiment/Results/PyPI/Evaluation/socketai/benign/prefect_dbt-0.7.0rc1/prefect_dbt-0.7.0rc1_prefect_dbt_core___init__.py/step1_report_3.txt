{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define module exports for a package, specifically exposing PrefectDbtRunner and PrefectDbtSettings classes or functions for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .runner and .settings",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or external communication present",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only manages imports and exports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports specific classes or functions from local modules and declares them for export. There is no dynamic code execution, no external input handling, no network activity, and no sensitive data handling. It appears to be standard module setup code with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and serves to expose components of a module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks in this snippet.",
