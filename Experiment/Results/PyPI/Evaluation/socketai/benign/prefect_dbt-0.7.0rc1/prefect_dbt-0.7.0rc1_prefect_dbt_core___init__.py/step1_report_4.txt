{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define module exports for a Python package, specifically exporting classes or functions PrefectDbtRunner and PrefectDbtSettings.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.runner and .settings), likely within the same package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data output points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; this is a straightforward module import/export declaration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code patterns are present. No obfuscated or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports specific classes or functions from local modules and sets the __all__ variable to define public API exports. It does not perform any data processing, network operations, or system modifications. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious intent are visible in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python module defining public exports with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is minimal, well-structured, and appears benign.",
