{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python module that imports and exposes specific classes for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.runner and .settings).",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling occurs in this snippet; no untrusted data processing or output.",
  "flows": "Imports modules and exposes classes; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual constructs detected. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two classes, PrefectDbtRunner and PrefectDbtSettings, from local modules and defines an __all__ list for module exports. It contains no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The structure is typical for Python package initialization or module setup. No anomalies, malicious behavior, or obfuscation are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module export setup with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign part of a larger project.",
