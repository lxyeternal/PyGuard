{
  "purpose": "Defines configuration settings for PrefectDbtRunner, including profile and project directories, and log level.",
  "sources": "Environment variables with prefix 'DBT_' that may override default settings.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; the code primarily reads environment variables and sets default paths.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'DBT_' prefix potentially influences configuration; no data flows to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; straightforward configuration class.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and defines a configuration class using pydantic, with defaults for directory paths and log level. It reads environment variables with prefix 'DBT_' to override defaults, which is typical for configuration management. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected; no data exfiltration, malicious code, or obfuscation. The structure is clean, and no hidden or malicious logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate configuration class for a database runner, with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It simply manages settings using environment variables and default paths, with no suspicious behavior.",
