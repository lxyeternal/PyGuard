{
  "purpose": "Defines configuration settings for PrefectDbtRunner, allowing for automatic discovery and manual configuration of paths and log levels.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables prefixed with 'DBT_' to set configuration options.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks observed; no output or data transmission points.",
  "flows": "Environment variables (sources) influence class attributes (sinks) via pydantic settings.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Use of default paths and environment-based configuration is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a class inheriting from BaseSettings to load configuration from environment variables with the prefix 'DBT_'. It sets default paths for profiles and project directories and a log level. No malicious or suspicious behavior, no dynamic code execution, no data exfiltration, and no obfuscated code detected.",
  "conclusion": "This appears to be a standard configuration class for managing settings related to dbt with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
