  "purpose": "Defines configuration settings for PrefectDbtRunner, including environment variable prefix and default paths.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (via pydantic's BaseSettings), Path functions for default directories.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; configuration data is set via environment variables or defaults.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> BaseSettings initialization -> class attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated elements observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a settings class using pydantic's BaseSettings, allowing configuration via environment variables with a specific prefix. Default paths are set to user home directory for profiles and current working directory for projects. No user input is directly processed; the code relies on environment variables for configuration. No sensitive data, external network interactions, or obfuscation present. The structure appears standard for configuration classes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration class with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It securely manages environment-based configuration without any evident security risks.",
