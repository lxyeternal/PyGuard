  "purpose": "Utilities for managing and resolving dbt profiles.yml files, including resolving block document and variable references.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (DBT_PROFILES_DIR), filesystem (loading profiles.yml, creating temp directories), function calls to resolve_block_document_references and resolve_variables.",
  "sinks": "Writing environment variable values into os.environ, writing resolved YAML content to temporary files.",
  "flows": "Loading profiles from disk -> resolving references/variables -> updating environment variables -> writing to temp files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Usage of environment variables is controlled and limited to standard patterns. No obfuscated or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code loads a YAML configuration file from a user-specified or default directory, resolves block references and variables via imported functions, and writes the processed configuration into a temporary directory. It uses environment variables to determine the profiles directory and populates environment variables with slugified placeholders. Both asynchronous and synchronous context managers are used for temporary directories and file handling. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or malicious behaviors are present. The external functions (resolve_block_document_references, resolve_variables) are assumed to perform safe operations. There are no indications of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility module for resolving dbt profile configurations with no malicious intent detected. It safely handles files, environment variables, and references, with no suspicious or malicious activity observed.",
