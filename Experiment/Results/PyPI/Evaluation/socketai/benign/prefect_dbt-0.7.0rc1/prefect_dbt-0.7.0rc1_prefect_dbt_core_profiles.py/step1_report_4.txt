  "purpose": "Utilities for resolving and managing dbt profiles.yml files, including environment variable substitution and reference resolution, both synchronously and asynchronously.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (os.getenv), reading profiles.yml from filesystem, and resolving references via imported functions.",
  "sinks": "Writing resolved profiles.yml to temporary directory; setting environment variables via os.environ.",
  "flows": "Read environment variables -> load profiles.yml -> resolve references and variables -> write resolved file to temporary directory -> set environment variables during replacement.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious hardcoded secrets, no suspicious network connections, no obfuscated code or hidden backdoors. Usage of environment variables and temp files is standard practice. The code performs reference resolution and variable substitution in a controlled manner.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily loads a YAML configuration file, resolves references and variables using imported utility functions, and writes the processed content to a temporary directory for further use. It sets environment variables dynamically based on placeholders. There are no suspicious network activities, no code that exfiltrates data, nor any backdoors or malicious behaviors detected. The functions seem to facilitate predictable and safe operations related to configuration management. No obfuscation or malicious intent is evident, and the operations are consistent with legitimate configuration handling. The only potential concern is the dynamic setting of environment variables, but this is part of normal variable resolution procedures in configuration processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate configuration utility functions for managing dbt profiles with reference and variable resolution. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks beyond normal variable handling. It appears safe based on the provided code.",
