  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code behaviors. Usage of environment variables and file I/O are standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves a directory path from an environment variable or defaults to a user directory, then loads a YAML configuration file from that location. The code uses safe methods for environment access and file handling, with error handling for missing files. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as utility functions for configuration management. No malicious intent or suspicious activity detected.",
