  "sources": "Reads environment variables (DBT_PROFILES_DIR), filesystem (profiles.yml file).",
  "sinks": "Reads from filesystem (profiles.yml), potential to raise exceptions if file not found.",
  "flows": "Environment variable DBT_PROFILES_DIR influences profiles_dir path -> profiles.yml loaded from disk.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets, no suspicious code patterns, no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code safely retrieves a directory path from an environment variable or defaults to a user directory. It then constructs a file path and attempts to load a YAML configuration file. The only sensitive operation is reading a local file, which is typical for configuration management. No data is sent over the network or manipulated in an insecure manner. Exception handling is used for missing files. Usage of 'yaml.safe_load' is appropriate and secure for parsing YAML data. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard configuration file handling with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It reads configuration data securely and does not contain malicious logic.",
