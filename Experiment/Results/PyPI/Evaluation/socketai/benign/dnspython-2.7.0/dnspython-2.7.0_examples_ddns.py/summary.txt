  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, straightforward DDNS updater template with security misconfigurations (hardcoded secrets and server IPs). No evidence of malware or obfuscation exists. The security risks are related to configuration, not malicious activity. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior and potential security weaknesses."
