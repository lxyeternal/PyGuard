  "purpose": "A Python script to perform a TSIG-signed DNS update, changing hostname-to-IP mapping based on input IP address.",
  "sources": "Command-line argument sys.argv[1] for IP address; hardcoded TSIG key, domain, hostname, and DNS server IP.",
  "sinks": "dns.query.tcp sending data to DNS server at 10.0.0.1; dns.update constructing DNS update packet with input IP.",
  "flows": "Input IP from sys.argv[1] flows into dns.update.replace; then dns.query.tcp transmits the update to the server.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded TSIG key, domain, hostname, and DNS server IP; no input validation; straightforward code with no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard DNS update using TSIG authentication, with static credentials and server info. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity is present. The main security concern is the hardcoded secrets and server IP, which pose risks if exposed, but do not indicate malicious intent. The code's simplicity and purpose are legitimate; no backdoors or malicious payloads are detected. The lack of input validation is a security weakness but not malicious. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2–0.4) are appropriate given the context.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, straightforward DDNS updater template with security misconfigurations (hardcoded secrets and server IPs). No evidence of malware or obfuscation exists. The security risks are related to configuration, not malicious activity. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior and potential security weaknesses.",
