{
  "purpose": "The code constructs and sends various DNS queries with EDNS0 options to test server responses and diagnostics.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from fixed IP addresses (root server and ISC server) and constructs DNS query messages with specific EDNS0 options.",
  "sinks": "The code receives DNS responses and processes the options within, printing out option types and data; no untrusted data is written or transmitted externally.",
  "flows": "Queries are constructed with specific EDNS0 options, sent via UDP to fixed addresses, and responses are processed to extract EDNS options, which are then printed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; the code is straightforward and uses standard DNS query construction.",
  "analysis": "The script creates multiple DNS queries with various EDNS0 options (NSID, COOKIE, ECS, buffer size) and sends them to known DNS servers. It does not process or store sensitive data beyond DNS queries, nor does it perform any malicious actions such as data exfiltration or system modification. The code is for testing or diagnostic purposes. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The use of fixed IP addresses and EDNS options is typical for network testing. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the benign, diagnostic nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign DNS diagnostic utility for testing EDNS0 features and server responses. There is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
