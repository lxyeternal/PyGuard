  "purpose": "Load DNS zone files, extract A records, and create a reverse mapping of IP addresses to domain names.",
  "sources": "Reads zone files specified as command-line arguments using dns.zone.from_file().",
  "sinks": "Outputs printed to stdout; no direct sinks for untrusted data, but the code processes data from files that could be maliciously crafted.",
  "flows": "Reads zone file data -> extracts A records -> builds a reverse map from IP addresses to domain names -> prints sorted results.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. The only potentially risky aspect is processing external files without validation, but this is standard for DNS zone parsing scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script loads DNS zone files, extracts A records, and maps IPs to domain names, then outputs the data. There is no network communication, code injection, or data leakage beyond printing parsed data. It uses the 'dns' library functions correctly without apparent malicious modifications. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are present. The overall behavior is consistent with a DNS zone processing utility, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward DNS zone processing script with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It reads user-supplied files, processes them, and outputs information. There are no signs of malware or security risks beyond the inherent trust in external files. Overall, the script is safe.",
