{
  "purpose": "Load DNS zone files, extract A records, and create a reverse mapping of IP addresses to domain names.",
  "sources": "Reads zone files specified as command-line arguments; reads data from files via dns.zone.from_file.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to standard output; processes DNS data but does not write or transmit untrusted data elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Zone file data is read and parsed into DNS zone objects; A records' addresses are mapped to domain names; sorted and printed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded credentials or secret keys; no obfuscated code; no network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The script processes input zone files to extract A records, building a reverse mapping from IP addresses to domain names. It uses standard DNS library functions, performs straightforward data collection, and outputs results. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system modification, or network communication is evident. The code is standard for DNS zone processing and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate DNS zone processing script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply reads zone files, extracts A records, and prints a reverse mapping. No vulnerabilities or malware indicators detected.",
