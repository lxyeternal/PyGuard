  "purpose": "The script loads DNS zone files, extracts 'A' records, and creates a reverse mapping of IP addresses to domain names, then prints the sorted mappings.",
  "sources": "Reading filenames from command line arguments; reading zone data from files via dns.zone.from_file; iterating over 'A' records in the zone data.",
  "sinks": "Printing the final IP-to-domain mappings; no other sink functions present.",
  "flows": "Input filenames -> dns.zone.from_file reads zone data -> iterate_rdatas extracts 'A' records -> rdata.address used as key -> output via print.",
  "anomalies": "None detected. No hardcoded credentials, no unusual or suspicious code structures, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated code. The script is straightforward DNS zone parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and reads DNS zone files specified as command-line arguments. It extracts 'A' records, captures their IP addresses, and maps each address to associated hostnames, constructing a reverse lookup table. The implementation includes error handling when adding hostnames to the mapping. The final output is sorted by IP addresses using dns.ipv4.inet_aton for proper IP sorting. The script performs DNS data processing securely and without suspicious behavior. No malicious or security-threatening code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign DNS zone processing tool with no indications of malicious intent or security issues. It solely parses DNS zone files, builds a reverse IP-to-hostname mapping, and prints the results. No suspicious or malicious activity is detected.",
