{
  "purpose": "The code performs DNS queries over TLS to resolve a domain name, likely for privacy or security purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads the DNS query parameters 'qname' and 'where' (DNS server IP).",
  "sinks": "DNS query function 'dns.query.tls' sending data over network to 1.1.1.1.",
  "flows": "User-defined 'qname' and DNS server IP are used as input; the query is sent via 'dns.query.tls' to the specified server; responses are processed and printed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns observed. No obfuscation or malicious code behaviors present.",
  "analysis": "The script constructs a DNS A record query for 'example.com.' and sends it over DNS over TLS to 1.1.1.1. It utilizes dnspython library functions appropriately for privacy-preserving DNS resolution. There are no signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The code appears straightforward and intended for legitimate DNS querying. No unusual or suspicious code patterns or secrets detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for DNS over TLS queries using dnspython. It performs expected functions without any malicious intent or security risks. No anomalies or malware are present.",
