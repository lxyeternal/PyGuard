  "purpose": "Send DNS queries over TLS (DoT) to a specified DNS server",
  "sources": "User-defined variables 'where' and 'qname' for DNS server address and query name",
  "sinks": "dns.query.tls function sending DNS query over network",
  "flows": "Variables 'q' (DNS query message) passed to dns.query.tls which sends over network to 'where' (1.1.1.1)",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Uses standard dnspython library for DNS over TLS.",
  "analysis": "The script constructs a DNS query for 'example.com.' and sends it over DNS over TLS to 1.1.1.1. It employs standard libraries and functions without obfuscation or suspicious behavior. No data exfiltration, system modification, or malicious network activity is evident. The code is straightforward and intended for legitimate DNS lookups over encrypted channels.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard DNS over TLS query using dnspython library with no signs of malicious behavior. It appears to be a benign example script for DNS security or privacy testing.",
