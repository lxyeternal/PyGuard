  "purpose": "Perform DNS queries over TLS to resolve domain names securely.",
  "sources": "Reads the target DNS server IP ('1.1.1.1') and the query domain ('example.com').",
  "sinks": "Outputs DNS response answers to standard output.",
  "flows": "Reads target server IP and query domain (source) -> Sends DNS query over TLS -> Receives DNS response -> Prints answers.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded IP and domain are typical for DNS queries; no suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports dnspython modules to construct and send a DNS query over TLS to a specified server. It uses hardcoded values for the DNS server ('1.1.1.1') and domain ('example.com'), which are standard for example scripts. The query is made for an A record, and responses are printed. The code performs a simple, intended DNS resolution with no malicious or suspicious logic, no data leaks, environment variable usage, or obfuscation. No external or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward example demonstrating DNS over TLS. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, and performs a benign network operation. It appears to be educational or illustrative.",
