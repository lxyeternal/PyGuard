  "purpose": "Send DNS queries over TLS to a specified DNS server (1.1.1.1) for resolving a domain name.",
  "sources": "Input data is the 'where' variable ('1.1.1.1') and 'qname' ('example.com.').",
  "sinks": "DNS query function (dns.query.tls) sending data to external server; printing DNS response answers.",
  "flows": "Construct DNS query from 'qname' -> send via tls() to 'where' -> receive response 'r' -> iterate and print answers.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior; no obfuscation or suspicious activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The script constructs a DNS query for 'example.com.' and sends it over DNS over TLS to 1.1.1.1 using dnspython library. It simply performs a DNS lookup and prints the answers. The code uses standard library functions, no dynamic code execution, and does not contain hardcoded secrets beyond the server IP and domain name, which are typical for such utility scripts. No signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity are present. The purpose appears to be legitimate DNS resolution over secure transport.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign DNS query over TLS without any suspicious or malicious behavior. No security risks or malware indications are present.",
