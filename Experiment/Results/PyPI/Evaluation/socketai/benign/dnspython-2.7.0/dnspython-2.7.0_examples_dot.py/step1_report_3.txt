{
  "purpose": "The code performs DNS queries over TLS to resolve a domain name (example.com) using the DNS over TLS protocol.",
  "sources": "The code reads the variable 'where' for the DNS server address and the variable 'qname' for the domain to resolve.",
  "sinks": "The code prints DNS answer records, which could potentially leak DNS query results to the console.",
  "flows": "The code constructs a DNS query from 'qname', sends it over TLS to the server specified in 'where', and outputs the response.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or unusual behavior are present. The code uses standard libraries and functions for DNS over TLS.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward example of performing DNS queries over TLS using dnspython. It uses hardcoded IP '1.1.1.1' as the DNS server and 'example.com.' as the query domain. No user input handling, external data sources, or suspicious code features are present. It does not perform any malicious actions like data exfiltration, backdoors, or system manipulation. The use of standard libraries and functions indicates typical functionality for DNS over TLS lookup without obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign example demonstrating DNS over TLS queries. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. No suspicious activity or anomalies are detected.",
