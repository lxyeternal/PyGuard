  "purpose": "Performs a DNS A record query for 'example.com.' over DNS over TLS to 1.1.1.1 using dnspython.",
  "sources": "Reads static variables 'where' (DNS server IP) and 'qname' (domain name).",
  "sinks": "Outputs DNS response answers to the console.",
  "flows": "Constructs DNS query -> Sends over TLS to server -> Receives response -> Prints answers.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward DNS over TLS query with no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets beyond server IP and domain.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, standard implementation of DNS over TLS query using dnspython. It does not contain obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors. It reads static data, sends a network request, and outputs the response. No vulnerabilities, data leaks, or malicious activities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1) are consistent with its benign, illustrative purpose. Confidence in this assessment is high (≥0.9).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performs a standard DNS over TLS query, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
