      "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing internal serialization verification of a DNS MX record object. The use of pickle, while generally insecure, is safe in this context due to the controlled data flow. No malicious activity or malicious intent is detected. The main security consideration is the inherent risk of pickle if the pickle file is replaced or tampered with externally, which is not applicable here. Overall, the code presents minimal security risk."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign DNS zone parser with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The low security risk scores are justified, primarily due to processing external, potentially untrusted files. The debug print statement can be removed for production but does not introduce security issues."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign DNS testing and diagnostic script that employs EDNS options and external IP fetching for ECS configuration. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. Privacy concerns are present but do not constitute malicious intent. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The security risk score could be slightly increased to reflect privacy implications, but current scores are reasonable. Overall, the script is safe and primarily used for network diagnostics."
