  "purpose": "The script performs various DNS queries to specified domain names with different EDNS options, including custom options and retrieving external IP address.",
  "sources": "Reads domain names (l and i), external IP address from https://ident.me",
  "sinks": "DNS resolver queries to 8.8.8.8, print statements outputting DNS query results",
  "flows": "Input domains and external IP to DNS resolver with EDNS options, output results via print",
  "anomalies": "Usage of external IP fetching; multiple EDNS options including COOKIE and ECS; no explicit data validation or security checks; no suspicious code injection or backdoors",
  "analysis": "The code constructs multiple DNS query configurations with different EDNS options, including NSID, COOKIE, ECS, and external IP-based ECS. It fetches external IP address using urllib, then performs DNS queries with these options via dns.resolver. All DNS queries target publicly available DNS servers (8.8.8.8). There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The usage of external IP fetching is benign in this context, intended for DNS EDNS options configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate DNS query testing tool, exploring EDNS options and retrieving external IP address. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities detected. It performs benign network operations with no signs of malicious intent.",
