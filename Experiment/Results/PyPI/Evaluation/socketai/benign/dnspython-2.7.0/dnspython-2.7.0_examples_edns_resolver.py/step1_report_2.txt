{
  "purpose": "The script performs various DNS queries with different EDNS options to test or retrieve DNS information for specific domains.",
  "sources": "The code reads external IP address from https://ident.me and DNS server responses via dns.resolver.Resolver() with custom EDNS options.",
  "sinks": "DNS query responses are printed; external IP data is fetched and used to configure EDNS options, potentially exposing local IP.",
  "flows": "External IP is fetched and used in EDNS ECS options, then DNS queries are made and responses are printed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of external IP fetch could be exploited for data leakage. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors identified. No suspicious behavior or code injection detected.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs multiple DNS queries with different EDNS options, including NSID, COOKIE, and ECS. It fetches the machine's external IP address via urllib.request from a public service and uses it in DNS options. The DNS resolver is configured with Google's DNS server (8.8.8.8). The code performs and prints DNS resolution results. No malicious intent or harmful behavior is evident; it appears to be diagnostic or testing code. The external IP fetch could potentially leak local IP info, but it is a common pattern and not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a DNS querying tool with various EDNS options, fetching external IP data for ECS options. There is no evidence of malicious intent or malware. It may pose a minor privacy concern due to external IP fetching but overall appears benign.",
