  "purpose": "Demonstrates how to construct and send a DNS query with an EDNS Client Subnet (ECS) option using the dns library.",
  "sources": "The address variable 'ADDRESS' used in ECSOption, the DNS query constructed with make_query, and the UDP send to 8.8.8.8.",
  "sinks": "The DNS query packet sent over UDP; potential leakage of 'ADDRESS' via ECS, but no malicious sink or data exfiltration present.",
  "flows": "The code creates ECSOption from ADDRESS and PREFIX, attaches it to the DNS query, and sends the query over UDP to 8.8.8.8.",
  "anomalies": "Use of placeholder address '0.0.0.0' and prefix 0, which are typical for testing; no malicious or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward DNS query with ECS, using standard library functions. No malicious payloads, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The only concern is privacy leakage via ECS, which is a known feature, not malicious. The use of '0.0.0.0' and prefix 0 is typical for demonstration. Scores assigned in reports (malware: 0, risk: ~0.1-0.2, obfuscated: 0) are consistent with this benign assessment. No errors or inconsistencies are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard example of DNS querying with ECS. No malicious activity, malware, or obfuscation detected. Privacy implications are minimal and expected for such scripts. Scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
