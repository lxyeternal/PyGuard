{
  "purpose": "The code constructs a DNS query with an EDNS client subnet option and sends it to a DNS server to retrieve the IP address for 'www.google.com'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the address, prefix, and DNS query response data from the network and DNS modules.",
  "sinks": "The code sends a DNS query over UDP to an external DNS server (8.8.8.8).",
  "flows": "The address and prefix are used to create an EDNS option, which is included in the DNS query; the query is then sent to the external DNS server, and the response is printed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious domain connections, or obfuscated code. Usage of standard DNS libraries and no malicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The script creates an EDNS client subnet option, likely for privacy or location-specific DNS querying, then constructs a DNS query for 'www.google.com' without using EDNS (use_edns=0), which is inconsistent but not malicious. The DNS query is sent via UDP to Google's DNS server, and the response is printed. No suspicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious actions are evident. The code is straightforward and appears to be for legitimate DNS querying purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard DNS query with EDNS client subnet options, without any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain hardcoded credentials or malicious payloads.",
