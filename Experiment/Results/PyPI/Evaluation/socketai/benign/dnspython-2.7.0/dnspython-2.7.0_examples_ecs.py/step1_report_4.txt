{
  "purpose": "Perform a DNS query for 'www.google.com' using EDNS Client Subnet options to customize the DNS request behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads the target domain ('www.google.com'), DNS server IP ('8.8.8.8'), and the address for the ECS option ('0.0.0.0').",
  "sinks": "The DNS query is sent over UDP to 8.8.8.8, which is a trusted DNS server, with no untrusted output or external data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "The address and prefix are used to create an ECSOption, which is included in the DNS query, then the query is sent via UDP to a DNS server, and the response is printed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors; the code is a straightforward DNS query with ECS option configuration. The ADDRESS is set to '0.0.0.0', which is a placeholder and not malicious but indicates incomplete configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports DNS-related modules, constructs an ECS (EDNS Client Subnet) option with user-specified address and prefix, creates a DNS query for 'www.google.com' with this option, and sends the query to 8.8.8.8 over UDP. The response is printed. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The placeholder address suggests the script might be used for testing or configuration purposes. The use of standard DNS libraries and no suspicious external interactions or obfuscated code indicates no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate example of sending a DNS query with an ECS option; it does not contain malicious code or behavior. The only potential concern is the placeholder address, which indicates incomplete or test code, not malicious activity.",
