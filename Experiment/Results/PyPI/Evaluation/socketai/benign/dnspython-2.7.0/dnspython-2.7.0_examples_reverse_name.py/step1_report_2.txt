  "purpose": "Resolve an IP address to its reverse DNS hostname and then convert that hostname back to an IP address.",
  "sources": "Input IP address '127.0.0.1' hardcoded in the code",
  "sinks": "Print statements outputting the hostname and IP address",
  "flows": "The hardcoded IP address is converted to a hostname, which is then converted back to an IP address and both outputs are printed",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs standard DNS reverse lookup and conversion functions without any suspicious or unusual behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports the dns.reversename module, performs a reverse DNS lookup on the local loopback IP '127.0.0.1', prints the hostname, and then converts this hostname back to its IP address. All operations use standard library functions without user input, external data, or hidden behaviors. No hardcoded secrets, malicious payloads, or suspicious code flows are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs simple DNS reverse lookup and conversion without any malicious intent or security issues. It is a benign example of DNS resolution code with no signs of malware or security risks.",
