{
  "purpose": "The code performs a DNS reverse lookup for the IP address 127.0.0.1 and prints the resulting hostname and address.",
  "sources": "The input source is a hardcoded IP address '127.0.0.1' within the code itself.",
  "sinks": "The DNS reverse lookup functions do not send data over the network in an untrusted manner; they query local DNS resolution mechanisms.",
  "flows": "Input IP address -> dns.reversename.from_address() -> hostname -> dns.reversename.to_address() -> IP address",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code uses standard DNS reverse lookup functions without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script uses the 'dns.reversename' module to convert an IP address to its DNS PTR record name and then back to an IP address. The IP address is hardcoded and trusted. The functions perform DNS queries, but these are typical and safe operations for resolving DNS names locally or via DNS servers. There are no signs of data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior. The code's structure is straightforward and uses standard libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple DNS reverse lookup example with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It performs standard operations for DNS resolution without any suspicious activity.",
