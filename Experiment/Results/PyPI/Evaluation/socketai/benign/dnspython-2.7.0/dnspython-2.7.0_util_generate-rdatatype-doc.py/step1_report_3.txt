{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to display the list of DNS resource data types from the dns.rdatatype module with their corresponding integer values.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the dns.rdatatype module, specifically iterating over RdataType enumeration and using to_text function to convert types to text.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input; the code only prints predefined data from a standard library module.",
  "flows": "Iterates over dns.rdatatype.RdataType to create a mapping, then prints each type's name and value.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code performs straightforward enumeration and printing.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific DNS module and enumerates its RdataType members, converting their names for display. It stores these in a dictionary and prints formatted documentation strings for each type. There are no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious data handling or network activity. It appears to be informational and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This script simply enumerates and displays DNS resource data types from a standard library module with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears to be a benign utility for informational purposes.",
