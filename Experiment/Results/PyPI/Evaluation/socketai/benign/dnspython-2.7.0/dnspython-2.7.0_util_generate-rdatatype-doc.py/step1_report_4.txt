{
  "purpose": "The code aims to list and print the numeric values of DNS resource record types by their textual names.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the dns.rdatatype module, specifically accessing RdataType enumeration and to_text function.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or output; all outputs are from a trusted library and are printed directly.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves data from dns.rdatatype.RdataType, processes it, and outputs formatted strings. No untrusted data sources or sinks are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code simply enumerates and formats existing data from a library.",
  "analysis": "The script imports dns.rdatatype, iterates over its RdataType enumeration, converts each type to a text label, replaces hyphens with underscores, and stores these in a dictionary. It then sorts and prints each name with its associated numeric value. All operations are straightforward and involve only reading from a library and printing data, with no external input, network access, or data manipulation that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign enumeration and display of DNS resource record types from a standard library. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
