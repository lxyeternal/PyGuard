  "purpose": "The code enumerates DNS resource record types from the dns.rdatatype module, converting enum values to text and printing their names and integer representations.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the dns.rdatatype.RdataType enumeration.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs data to standard output via print statements.",
  "flows": "Enumeration of RdataType values → Conversion to text and string replacement → Printing formatted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is static, straightforward, and relies solely on a standard library.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a standard DNS data type module, iterates over its enumeration, converts each value to text, replaces hyphens with underscores, and prints the name and value. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. The code serves as a utility for listing DNS resource types. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The scores assigned by all reports (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the benign and static nature of the code. There are no logical errors or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility script that enumerates and displays DNS resource record types from a standard library. It poses no security risks, malware, or obfuscation concerns. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
