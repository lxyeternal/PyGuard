{
  "purpose": "The code outputs the list of DNS resource record data types defined in the dns.rdatatype module, mapping their names to integer values.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the dns.rdatatype.RdataType enumeration when iterating over its members.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or written; the code only prints static information.",
  "flows": "The data flows from the enumeration (source) through transformation (name replacement) to printed output, with no untrusted input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present. The code simply accesses a known enumeration and prints its contents.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific module, dns.rdatatype, then iterates over its RdataType enumeration to extract names, modifies these names by replacing hyphens with underscores, and stores them with their corresponding integer values in a dictionary. It then sorts and prints these names with their integer annotations. There are no external inputs, no data transformations involving untrusted sources, and no sensitive operations. The code appears to serve a documentation or informational purpose without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for displaying DNS resource record types. It does not contain malware, suspicious behaviors, or security risks. No anomalies or malicious activities are evident.",
