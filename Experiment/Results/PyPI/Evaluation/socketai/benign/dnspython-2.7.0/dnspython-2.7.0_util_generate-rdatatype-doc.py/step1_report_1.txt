  "purpose": "The code enumerates DNS resource record types from the dns.rdatatype module and prints their names and corresponding integer values.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the dns.rdatatype.RdataType enumeration.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs data to standard output (print statements).",
  "flows": "Data flows from the dns.rdatatype.RdataType enumeration to the console output via iteration and text conversion.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the dns.rdatatype module and iterates over its RdataType enumeration. It converts each enumeration value to text, replaces hyphens with underscores, and maps the cleaned name to its integer value. The data is then printed in a formatted manner. The code performs simple enumeration and display without any data manipulation, network activity, or potentially malicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and appears to serve as a utility for listing DNS resource record types. No malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks are present. The overall security risk is negligible.",
