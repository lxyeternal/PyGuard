  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, reads data from the `dns.rdatatype` module, and outputs information about DNS resource record types.\n- No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or external input handling are identified.\n- The code is static, relies solely on standard library enumerations, and outputs formatted data.\n- No network activity, dynamic code execution, or handling of untrusted data is present.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious behavior.\n\n**Step-by-step review:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code is simple enumeration and printing; no issues are detected.\n   - No evidence of malicious intent, data manipulation, or security flaws.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - They correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `confidence: 1`.\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No need to adjust scores.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports suggest any risk that warrants a higher score.\n   - The code is purely informational, with no malicious or risky behavior.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n   - Malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid assumptions; they base their analysis on static code inspection.\n   - Their conclusions are justified.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\nGiven the analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is a benign utility for enumerating DNS resource record types, with no malicious intent or security issues.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is entirely safe, with no security risks or malware. The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.",
