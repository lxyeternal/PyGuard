{
  "purpose": "The code iterates over DNS resource data types and prints their names and corresponding integer values, likely for documentation or informational purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the dns.rdatatype module, specifically dns.rdatatype.RdataType and dns.rdatatype.to_text.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs that process untrusted input; only prints to standard output.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the dns.rdatatype module to the local variables, then to formatted print statements.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. The code simply accesses and displays constant values from a standard library.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the dns.rdatatype module and accesses the RdataType enumeration. It creates a dictionary mapping formatted resource record type names to their integer values. It then sorts and prints these pairs with specific formatting. All operations are straightforward and based on a standard library without any dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious behavior indicators.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility script to display DNS resource data types and their corresponding numeric codes. It contains no malicious intent, no suspicious data handling, and no security risks.",
