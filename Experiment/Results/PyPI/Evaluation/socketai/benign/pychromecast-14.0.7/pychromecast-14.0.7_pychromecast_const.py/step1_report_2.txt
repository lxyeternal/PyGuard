  "sources": "No external data sources; static constant definitions and dictionary mappings",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data outputs present",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data handling; purely static configuration data",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns; no obfuscation or dynamic code execution",
  "analysis": "The code only defines constant strings and a dictionary for device types and manufacturer labels. It contains no input handling, network operations, or data processing logic. There are no suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious patterns identified. All data appears static and intended for device identification purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely static configuration data for Chromecast device constants and mappings, with no malicious behavior or security risks present.",
