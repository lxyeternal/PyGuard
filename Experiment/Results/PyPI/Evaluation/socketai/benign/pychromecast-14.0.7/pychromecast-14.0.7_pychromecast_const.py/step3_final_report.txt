  "purpose": "Static configuration defining Chromecast device types, manufacturers, and message keys for device identification and categorization.",
  "sources": "Constants and mappings for device types, manufacturer labels, and message identifiers within the code.",
  "sinks": "No data flows to or from untrusted sources; static constants with no external input or output.",
  "flows": "None; the code contains only static definitions without data flow or dynamic processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; straightforward static constants and mappings.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely static, consisting of string constants and a dictionary mapping device names to device types and manufacturers. There are no functions, data processing, network operations, or dynamic behaviors. The code does not handle external input, perform any data flow, or contain obfuscation. All signals indicate benign static configuration data intended for device identification. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, which are consistent with the code's static and benign nature. The confidence in this assessment is 1.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static, benign configuration module for Chromecast device types and manufacturers. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
