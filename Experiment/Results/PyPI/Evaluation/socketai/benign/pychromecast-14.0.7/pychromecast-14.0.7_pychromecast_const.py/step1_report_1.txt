  "purpose": "Define constants and mappings for Chromecast device types, manufacturers, and related parameters used in a larger project.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions and dictionary mappings; no data input or external data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; the code does not process external inputs or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily sets static constants and mappings.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. No suspicious network or system calls.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises static constant definitions and a dictionary mapping device names to device types and manufacturers. No functions, data processing, or external interactions are present. The constants are straightforward, and the mapping appears to be a static lookup for device identification. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation are evident. The absence of input handling or external communication suggests low risk.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely definitional, establishing constants and mappings for device types and manufacturers. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is a safe, static configuration snippet with no malicious intent.",
