  "purpose": "Library for discovering and controlling Chromecast devices over the network, including device info retrieval and app management.",
  "sources": "Network discovery via zeroconf, socket communication, device info attributes, user inputs, threading events.",
  "sinks": "Potential data flows to network (device control commands), but no untrusted data sinks or exfiltration points evident.",
  "flows": "Discovery callbacks trigger device info retrieval; control commands invoke socket communication; status updates flow from device to client.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad wildcard imports (`from .config import *`, `from .error import *`) could conceal malicious code, but no evidence here; no hardcoded credentials or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard patterns for network device discovery and control, with well-structured classes and methods. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or malicious logic observed. The broad imports are a potential concern but do not constitute malicious behavior without evidence. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation present. The security risk is low, primarily due to typical network interactions and import practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation for Chromecast device discovery and control. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or high security risks are evident. The scores from the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
