The primary security issue is the insecure SSL context, which could be exploited in man-in-the-middle attacks but does not indicate malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score should be around 0.2 to 0.4, reflecting the SSL configuration concern."
