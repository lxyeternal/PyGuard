  "purpose": "Network discovery of Chromecast devices using zeroconf/mDNS, managing device info, and invoking user-defined callbacks upon device addition, removal, or update.",
  "sources": "zeroconf service info, device info fetch functions (get_device_info, get_multizone_status), network responses, callback invocations.",
  "sinks": "User-provided callback functions, network data transmission, device info processing.",
  "flows": "zeroconf service events (add/update/remove) trigger callbacks; device info functions fetch data; callbacks may execute external code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected. Use of threading and callbacks is standard; no malicious signals observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard Chromecast device discovery via zeroconf, with proper threading, SSL context handling, and callback mechanisms. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. External functions are assumed safe, and the logic aligns with typical network device discovery patterns. Callback functions are user-defined, which could be exploited if malicious code is supplied externally, but this is inherent in callback-based designs and not specific to malicious intent within this code. No secrets, suspicious network activity, or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard Chromecast discovery module with no malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The potential risk stems from callback execution if user code is malicious, but this is an inherent pattern, not a flaw. Scores are consistent with the code's behavior.",
