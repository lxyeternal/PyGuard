  "purpose": "Helper functions and classes for waiting for and handling command responses asynchronously.",
  "sources": "Initialization of threading.Event(), callback invocations, and imported modules. No external or untrusted input sources are explicitly read in this code.",
  "sinks": "Invocation of callback functions, setting of threading.Event, raising exceptions. No untrusted data output or external network calls are present.",
  "flows": "Thread sets event upon callback; wait_response waits for the event; chain_on_success calls callbacks based on message success.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious behaviors. The code uses threading.Event to synchronize callback completion safely.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility classes and functions for asynchronous response handling with threading. It manages callback invocation and response waiting safely without external data sources. No data leaks, injections, or malicious patterns are evident. No backdoors, network activities, or sensitive data handling are present. The structure and imports are standard for such utility modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility module for managing asynchronous command responses. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks. It is safe for use.",
