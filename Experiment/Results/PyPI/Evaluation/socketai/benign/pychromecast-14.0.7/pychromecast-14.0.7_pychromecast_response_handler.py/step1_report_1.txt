  "purpose": "Helpers and types for waiting for and handling command responses in asynchronous workflows.",
  "sources": "Code reads request strings, callback functions, and response data.",
  "sinks": "Callback functions may process untrusted data; no explicit sinks for system or network calls are present.",
  "flows": "Response data flows from callback invocations to callback functions; callback results may be processed or logged.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors observed. No system or network calls, file modifications, or credential handling present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data structures and utility functions for handling asynchronous request responses, including waiting mechanisms and callback chaining. It uses threading events for synchronization and a Protocol for callback type enforcement. No external system calls, network operations, or data leaks are evident. The code appears straightforward and safe, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The functions focus on request handling and callback management, which are common patterns in asynchronous programming.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of asynchronous response handling with callback chaining. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. It is safe and does not pose security risks.",
