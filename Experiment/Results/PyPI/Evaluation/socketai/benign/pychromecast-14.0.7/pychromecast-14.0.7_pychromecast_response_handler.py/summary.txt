  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for handling command responses asynchronously. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is evident. The primary security consideration is the potential execution of untrusted callback functions, which is typical in callback-based designs. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature."
