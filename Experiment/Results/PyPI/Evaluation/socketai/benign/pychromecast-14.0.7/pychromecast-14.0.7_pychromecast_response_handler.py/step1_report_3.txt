  "purpose": "Helpers and types for managing asynchronous command responses, including waiting for responses and callback chaining.",
  "sources": "None explicitly reading untrusted input; relies on internal threading events and callback functions.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the callback functions which could be user-supplied and may execute untrusted code if maliciously crafted.",
  "flows": "Callbacks invoke user-defined functions which may be untrusted; wait_response waits for threading events, unlikely to be exploited.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscation detected. Use of threading for synchronization is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines types and classes to handle asynchronous command responses via threading.Event. It provides mechanisms to wait for responses and chain callbacks. The callback functions are user-defined and invoked with response data, which could be malicious if supplied from untrusted sources. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or covert data exfiltration. The use of logging and threading appears standard for such utility functions. No obfuscated code or hardcoded credentials are present.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a standard utility for handling asynchronous command responses with callback support. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security breaches. The main security consideration is that callback functions executed are user-defined, which could potentially execute malicious code if supplied maliciously, but this is expected behavior for callback mechanisms and not inherently malicious.",
