  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports agree that the code consists solely of custom exception class definitions for error handling in the PyChromecast library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code is static, with no external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is straightforward, well-structured, and typical for error handling. No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - Malware: 0\n   - Obfuscated: 0\n   - SecurityRisk: 0  \n   \n   These scores are appropriate given the analysis. Since there's no malicious or obfuscated code, and no security vulnerabilities, these scores seem reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since all reports concur that the code is benign, the risk scores should remain at 0. The code is purely for defining exception classes, which are standard practice and do not introduce security concerns.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct. There is no indication of malicious code or behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on direct analysis of the code structure, content, and behavior. They correctly identify that the code is a standard error handling scaffold.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis. No discrepancies are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, standard, and poses no security risks.**\n\n---\n\n### My Expert Estimate:\n\nGiven the detailed analysis, I concur with the reports' conclusions. The code is purely for error handling, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis provided.",
