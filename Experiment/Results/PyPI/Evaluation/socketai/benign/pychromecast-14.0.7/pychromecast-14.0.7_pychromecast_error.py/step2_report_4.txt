  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of custom exception class definitions for error handling in the PyChromecast library.\n   - There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly note the absence of dynamic code, external data, or suspicious patterns.\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - These scores are reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:\n   - Since the code is purely defining static exception classes with no external interactions or dynamic behavior, higher risk scores are unwarranted.\n   - The reports' scores of 0 for malware and security risk are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:\n   - The code shows no malicious intent, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious behavior.\n   - The malware score of 0 across all reports is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - All reports are based on factual analysis, not assumptions.\n   - They correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:\n   - The scores are consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Systematic Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The code is a standard pattern for defining custom exceptions in Python.\n- No external dependencies, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- The static messages are safe and typical for such classes.\n\n**Conclusion**: The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risk in this code.\n\n---\n\n**Final Estimated Scores**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
