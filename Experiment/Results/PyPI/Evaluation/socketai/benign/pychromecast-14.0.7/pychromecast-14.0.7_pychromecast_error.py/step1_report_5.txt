  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in the PyChromecast library.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external interactions are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow exists; code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual patterns detected. The code is straightforward class definitions for exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from Exception or a base PyChromecastError class. Each class is used for specific error scenarios within the PyChromecast library, with no dynamic code execution, data processing, or external communication. The __init__ methods only format messages for exceptions and do not perform any suspicious actions. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns are present. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions for error handling within a library. It does not contain malware, security risks, or suspicious activity.",
