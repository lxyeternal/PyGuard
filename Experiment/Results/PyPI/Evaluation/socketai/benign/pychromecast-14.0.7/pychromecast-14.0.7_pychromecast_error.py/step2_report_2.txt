  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports confirm that the code consists solely of custom exception class definitions with static messages and no dynamic or external data handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. This aligns with the code provided, which is straightforward error handling scaffolding.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is purely for defining exceptions, with no suspicious or malicious elements. No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - Malware: 0\n   - Obfuscated: 0\n   - Security Risk: 0  \n   \n   These are appropriate given the code's nature. The risk scores are all zero, which is reasonable because there's no indication of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since all reports indicate no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues, elevating the risk score above 0.5 is unwarranted. The code is standard exception class definitions with no apparent security concerns.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious actions, such as executing code, network communication, or data exfiltration.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports are cautious and based on the code's static nature, with no assumptions about hidden behavior. They correctly conclude the code is benign.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis. No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exceptions for error handling.**  \nThere are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThe code is benign and poses no security risk. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as-is.",
