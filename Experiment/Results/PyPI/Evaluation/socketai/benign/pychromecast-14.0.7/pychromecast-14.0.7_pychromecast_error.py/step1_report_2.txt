  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in the PyChromecast library.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes and constants, no input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or output occurs within this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow, as this is a set of class definitions without execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded messages are static and relevant to error contexts. No suspicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of custom exception class definitions for the PyChromecast library, each representing specific error conditions. The classes inherit from a base exception class, with some providing custom messages initialized with parameters. There are no input, output, data processing, or network activities. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and contains no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is solely for defining custom exceptions related to Chromecast error handling. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The static messages and class structure are typical for error management, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
