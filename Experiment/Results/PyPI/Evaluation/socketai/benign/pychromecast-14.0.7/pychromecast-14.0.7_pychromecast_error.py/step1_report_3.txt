  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in the PyChromecast project.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; all exceptions are predefined and instantiated internally.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; exceptions are for control flow and error reporting within the application.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; exceptions are used internally and are not influenced by external input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from the base Exception class. Each class includes docstrings explaining its purpose and some have message templates for constructing error messages. There are no external data inputs, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The exception classes are standard practice for structured error handling and do not contain malicious code or behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of custom exception definitions for error management in the PyChromecast library. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, no suspicious activities, and no security risks. The structure is standard, with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation.",
