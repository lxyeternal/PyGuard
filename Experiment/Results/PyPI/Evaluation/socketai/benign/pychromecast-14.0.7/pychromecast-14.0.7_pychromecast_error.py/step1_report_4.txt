  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in the PyChromecast library.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs; class definitions are static and do not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data handling or external communication present.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or processing logic present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from a base exception. Each class provides specific error semantics for the PyChromecast library. The constructor methods format error messages for some exceptions, but there are no dynamic or external inputs involved. There are no code injections, network activities, or suspicious behaviors. The code is straightforward, purely defining exception types with descriptive messages. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard, static exception class definitions with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It serves as part of the error handling framework for the library without introducing security concerns.",
