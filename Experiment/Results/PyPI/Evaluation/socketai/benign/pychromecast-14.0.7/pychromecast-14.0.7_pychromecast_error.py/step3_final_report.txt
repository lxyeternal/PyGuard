  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in the PyChromecast library.",
  "sources": "Class definitions for exceptions; no external data or input sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static exception messages and class structures.",
  "flows": "No data flow; purely static class definitions with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, static, and standard for exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions with static messages, serving as error handling scaffolding. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution. The code does not interact with external data, network, or system resources. The structure is typical and safe, with no suspicious patterns or anomalies. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of zero. The code's static and transparent nature supports a conclusion of no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exceptions for the PyChromecast library. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
