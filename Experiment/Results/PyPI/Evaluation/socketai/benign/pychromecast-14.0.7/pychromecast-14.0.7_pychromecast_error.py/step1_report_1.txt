  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in the PyChromecast library.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and string constants within the code.",
  "sinks": "Instantiation of exception objects with formatted messages.",
  "flows": "Code execution flow involves raising specific exceptions based on different error conditions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from a base exception. The classes provide descriptive error messages and are used for handling various error conditions related to Chromecast operations. There are no inputs, data processing, or external interactions; the code serves as a structured error taxonomy. No suspicious or malicious behavior, data leaks, or backdoors are evident. The message formatting is straightforward and safe, with no dynamic code execution or external data usage. Overall, the code appears to be standard error handling scaffolding for a library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of custom exceptions for a Python library, with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
