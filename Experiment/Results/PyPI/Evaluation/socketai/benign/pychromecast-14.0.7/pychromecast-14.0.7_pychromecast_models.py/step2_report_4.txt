  "review": "Let's analyze this step-by-step.\n\n### 1. Confirm if the reported issues are present in the code\n- All reports indicate \"Empty response\" with no raw response data.\n- Since the code snippet provided is just class definitions and constants, there is no actual network interaction or response handling shown.\n- Therefore, **the reports of \"Empty response\" are not directly related to the code provided**. They likely refer to some external process or network request that is not included here.\n- **Conclusion:** The reported \"Empty response\" issues are not evident in the provided code snippet.\n\n### 2. Identify and record any errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic, reasoning, or summary\n- The reports lack context; they only mention \"Empty response\" without any details about the request, expected data, or how the response is handled.\n- Since no code for response handling or network requests is shown, these reports seem to be about external interactions, not the code itself.\n- **Error in reasoning:** The reports seem to assume the code is responsible for the empty responses, but based on the snippet, there's no evidence of such logic.\n- **Flaw:** The reports are not actionable without additional context or code.\n\n### 3. Review the scores given to each issue\n- No scores are provided in the reports, only error messages.\n- Since the reports are just stating \"Empty response,\" they do not specify any severity or risk.\n- **Suggestion:** Without scores, there's nothing to adjust. If scores were assigned, they should be low unless further context suggests otherwise.\n\n### 4. Justify any risk score higher than 0.5\n- No risk scores are provided, and the code itself does not exhibit any evident vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n- The code is primarily data class definitions and error handling constants.\n- **Conclusion:** No justification for high risk scores based on the provided code.\n\n### 5. Pay close attention to the malware score\n- The code does not contain any malicious logic or behavior.\n- No indication of malware activity in the code snippet.\n- The reports do not mention any malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Malware score should be 0.\n\n### 6. Challenge any claims about potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions\n- The reports are about empty responses, which could be normal in network operations or indicative of network issues.\n- Without additional context, claiming these are vulnerabilities is speculative.\n- **No evidence of vulnerabilities** in the code snippet.\n\n### 7. Ensure the scores are consistent with the report\n- Since no scores are provided, no inconsistency is apparent.\n- The reports lack sufficient detail to assign meaningful scores.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Code review:** The code appears correct and secure; it defines data structures and error constants.\n- **Issue reports:** They are not directly related to the code provided and lack context.\n- **Risk and malware scores:** Should be very low or zero, given no malicious or vulnerable code is present.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (nothing obfuscated)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal risk, mainly due to lack of context)\n\n**Summary:** The reports of \"Empty response\" are not indicative of issues within the provided code. They likely refer to external network interactions not shown here. The code itself is straightforward and does not contain vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.",
