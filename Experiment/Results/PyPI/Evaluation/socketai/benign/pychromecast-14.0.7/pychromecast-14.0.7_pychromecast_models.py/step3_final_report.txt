  "purpose": "Defines data structures for Chromecast device info and sets up error handling for zeroconf exceptions.",
  "sources": "No input sources; static data class definitions and error constants.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "None; code only declares classes and constants without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions and error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely structural, defining data containers for device info and error types. It does not perform network operations, response parsing, or any data handling that could be exploited. The reports indicating 'Empty response' are external and do not relate to this static code. No vulnerabilities, malicious code, or obfuscation are present. The code is correct, clear, and safe. Given the lack of active logic, the malware score is 0, and the security risk score is minimal.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a safe, well-structured set of data classes with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The 'Empty response' reports are unrelated to this code snippet and likely originate from external network interactions. Scores should reflect low risk and malware likelihood.",
