  "purpose": "Dispatcher function selecting and invoking media controllers based on app_name, managing registration with Chromecast.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: app_name, data, cast object",
  "sinks": "controller.quick_play method, which may process untrusted data",
  "flows": "app_name determines controller; cast.register_handler(controller); controller.quick_play(**data, timeout); cast.unregister_handler(controller)",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code; direct passing of untrusted data to controllers without validation",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward dispatcher mapping app_name to controller classes, registering the controller, invoking its quick_play method with provided data, and then unregistering. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or secrets. The main concern is passing unvalidated data to controllers, which depends on their internal implementation. The code structure is standard, with no dynamic code execution or network activity. Scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are justified given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard dispatcher for media controllers with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk score reflects potential concerns over unvalidated data passing, but overall, the code appears secure and legitimate.",
