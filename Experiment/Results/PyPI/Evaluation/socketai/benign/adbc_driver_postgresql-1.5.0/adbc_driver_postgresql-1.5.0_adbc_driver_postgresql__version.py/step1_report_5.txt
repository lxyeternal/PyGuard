{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to determine and return the version of a Python package, either from an environment variable override or from a static version file.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (os.environ.get) and opens a version file (_static_version.py) from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "The version information is stored in a dictionary and printed if executed directly; no direct sink for untrusted data leading to security issues is present.",
  "flows": "Input from environment variable or reading and executing code from the version file flows into the version determination logic; the data is used to return or print version info.",
  "anomalies": "Uses exec() to execute code read from a file, which can be dangerous if the file content is malicious or tampered with. The file is named '_static_version.py', which is a static file, but executing its content still poses risks if the file is compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code imports os for filesystem and environment variable access. It reads a version file ('_static_version.py') and executes its content with exec() to populate a dictionary. It also checks for an environment variable 'SETUPTOOLS_SCM_PRETEND_VERSION' to override version info. The use of exec() on file contents is a security concern, as malicious code could be embedded in the version file. However, since the version file is typically a static, controlled file, the risk is lower but not negligible. The code does not contain any network activity, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors beyond the exec() use.",
  "conclusion": "The main concern is the use of exec() to execute code from a version file, which could be malicious if the file is compromised. Otherwise, the code's functionality is straightforward and limited to version retrieval with no evident malicious intent.",
