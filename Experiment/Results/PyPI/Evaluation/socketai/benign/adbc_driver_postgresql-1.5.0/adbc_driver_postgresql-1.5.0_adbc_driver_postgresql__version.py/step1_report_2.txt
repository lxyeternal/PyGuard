{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to determine and retrieve the version information of a package, either from an environment variable override or from a static version file.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables ('SETUPTOOLS_SCM_PRETEND_VERSION') and reads a version file ('_static_version.py') from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "The code writes to the version_info dictionary via exec(), and reads environment variables and a file from disk.",
  "flows": "If environment variable is set, returns its value; otherwise, reads and executes the version file to extract version info.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on file contents can execute arbitrary code if the version file is malicious or tampered with.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily retrieves version info from a static file, using exec() which is inherently risky if the file content is malicious. The environment variable override is a typical pattern. No network activity, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic present. The use of exec() on a known filename is a potential security concern but appears intended for dynamic version parsing. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors identified. Overall, the code's purpose is benign but contains a potential execution risk if the version file is compromised.",
  "conclusion": "The code is intended for version retrieval and is not malicious. However, the use of exec() on a file read from disk presents a security risk if the version file is tampered with. The code does not exhibit malicious behavior or obfuscation. The risk is low but warrants caution regarding the integrity of the version file.",
