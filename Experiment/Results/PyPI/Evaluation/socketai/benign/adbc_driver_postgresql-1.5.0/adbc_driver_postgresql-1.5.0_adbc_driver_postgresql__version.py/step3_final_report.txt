  "purpose": "Retrieve package version information either from an environment variable or a static version file, executing code from the file to extract version info.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variable 'SETUPTOOLS_SCM_PRETEND_VERSION'; opening and reading '_static_version.py' file.",
  "sinks": "Execution of code read from '_static_version.py' via exec(), which can run arbitrary code if the file is compromised.",
  "flows": "Environment variable check -> get_static_version_info() -> open and read file -> exec() executes file content -> version info extracted.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on a static file to execute code, which can be malicious if the file is tampered with; no validation or sanitization performed.",
  "analysis": "The code's purpose is benign: to determine package version. The main security concern is the use of exec() on a file that could be maliciously modified, allowing arbitrary code execution. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present. The malware score is 0, as no malicious payloads are evident. The security risk score should be around 0.6 due to the unsafe exec() pattern, which could be exploited if the version file is compromised. The environment variable override is standard but can be exploited if environment variables are controlled by an attacker. The code should be refactored to avoid executing code from untrusted sources, such as importing the version directly or parsing the file safely.",
  "conclusion": "The code is generally benign but employs a risky pattern (exec() on a static file) that introduces a moderate security risk. No evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation is present. The malware score remains at 0, but the security risk score should be elevated to approximately 0.6 due to the potential for arbitrary code execution if the version file is compromised.",
