  "purpose": "To determine the version of the package based on static information or environment override.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'SETUPTOOLS_SCM_PRETEND_VERSION', reads version information from a file '_static_version.py'.",
  "sinks": "exec() function used to execute code read from a file.",
  "flows": "get_static_version_info() reads and executes code from '_static_version.py', which is then used by get_version() to obtain the version string.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to run code from a file, which could be malicious if the file contents are tampered with; reliance on external environment variable for version override.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily reads version information from a static file and an environment variable. The critical operation is the exec() call, which executes arbitrary code read from '_static_version.py'. If this file is modified or maliciously crafted, it could execute harmful code. However, the rest of the code appears straightforward, with no network operations, data exfiltration, or hidden behaviors. The use of exec() is a potential security concern, especially if the version file can be controlled by an attacker.",
  "conclusion": "The code is generally intended for version management and does not contain explicit malicious behavior. However, the use of exec() to execute contents of a version file poses a security risk if the file is compromised. No malicious intent is evident, but the exec() usage warrants caution.",
