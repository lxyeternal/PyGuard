  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the details, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard test suite for PostgreSQL driver, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.\n- **Analysis:** No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code. Uses standard libraries and practices.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1.0\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's straightforward nature. The low security risk score seems appropriate given the absence of sensitive data or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the code being a test suite, no malicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.95\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher security risk score, possibly due to the mention of error handling, but still justified given the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard test suite with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Analysis:** Uses typical testing libraries, no suspicious patterns, no external data leaks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.95\n\n**Assessment:** The zero security risk score is justified; no issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard testing code, no malicious intent.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious or malicious code, no dynamic execution, no external data leaks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The slightly higher security risk score might be conservative, but still consistent with the benign code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Clear, controlled test cases with no malicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** Uses static, controlled inputs; no untrusted data flow.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.0\n\n**Assessment:** Fully justified. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, standard testing code for a PostgreSQL driver.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n- The malware scores are consistently zero, which is appropriate.\n- The security risk scores are low, with some variation (0.1–0.2), which is reasonable given the context.\n\n### Final Step: Overall Assessment\n\n**Malware Score:**  \nAll reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, and I concur. The code does not exhibit any malicious behaviors.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:**  \nAll reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Risk Score:**  \nGiven the benign nature, I would assign a very low risk score, around **0.05**. The existing scores are slightly higher (up to 0.2), but still within reason considering the code's simplicity and testing purpose.\n\n**Additional Justification:**  \n- The code does not perform any dynamic code execution, network exfiltration, or handle untrusted user input beyond standard testing parameters.\n- The use of environment variables or external configuration for 'postgres_uri' is typical and not suspicious.\n- The test cases are safe, well-structured, and do not contain any hidden or obfuscated logic.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendation:**\n\n| Score Type     | Recommended Value | Justification                                              |\n|----------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0                   | No malicious behavior detected.                              |\n| Obfuscated     | 0                   | Clear, straightforward code.                                |\n| Security Risk  | 0.05                | Very low risk; standard testing code with no vulnerabilities.|\n\nThis reflects a cautious but accurate assessment based on the evidence.",
