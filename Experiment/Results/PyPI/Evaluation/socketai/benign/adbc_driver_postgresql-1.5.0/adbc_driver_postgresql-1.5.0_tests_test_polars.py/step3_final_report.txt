  "purpose": "Integration testing of Polars DataFrame writing to PostgreSQL database and cleanup.",
  "sources": "DataFrames created within the test function, uuid-generated table names, internal SQL commands.",
  "sinks": "Execution of raw SQL commands like DROP TABLE with internally generated table names.",
  "flows": "DataFrame creation -> write_database call -> SQL execution -> table cleanup via DROP TABLE.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external data influence detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard pytest-based test suite that creates DataFrames with uuid-based table names, writes them into PostgreSQL via Polars' write_database, and cleans up by dropping tables. The table names are generated internally, mitigating SQL injection risks. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The use of raw SQL commands is safe here due to controlled table name generation. The optional import of polars does not introduce risk. Overall, the code is benign, with minimal security risk primarily due to executing raw SQL commands, which are controlled and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard testing script with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the critical reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
