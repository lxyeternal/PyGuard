{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a metadata or versioning file generated for a Python package, providing version, reference names, and git hash information.",
  "sources": "Reads hardcoded version, refnames, and git_hash variables.",
  "targets": "No explicit data sink, but the metadata could be used by package managers or build tools.",
  "flows": "Hardcoded data (version, refnames, git_hash) is assigned and possibly utilized by external tools; no flow from untrusted sources detected.",
  "anomalies": "The file contains only static metadata; no suspicious code, dynamic execution, or obfuscated segments are present. No hardcoded credentials or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The file is a standard license and metadata header generated by a build tool (miniver). It includes licensing info, version, and git reference data. It does not contain code execution, external data input, or any behavior that could be malicious. Its structure and content are typical for open-source package metadata files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard metadata file with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
