  "sources": "Static variable assignments: version, refnames, git_hash.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output or external data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static assignments do not involve untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "None; code contains only license headers and static metadata variables.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely static, containing license headers and metadata variables with no dynamic code, input/output operations, obfuscation, or embedded logic. All reports correctly identify it as benign metadata. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's static, metadata-only nature. Confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, static metadata with no malicious or suspicious content. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
