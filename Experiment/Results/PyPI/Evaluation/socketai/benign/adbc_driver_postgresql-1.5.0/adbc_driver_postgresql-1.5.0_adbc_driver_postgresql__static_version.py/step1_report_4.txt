{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a versioning or metadata file for a Python package, specifically generated by a tool called 'miniver' to embed version and source control information.",
  "sources": "Reads static variables for versioning, git hash, and reference names",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs identified",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; purely static data assignments",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious logic",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static comments and variable assignments for version metadata. It is generated code from a versioning tool. There are no external inputs, no network operations, and no data processing. The variables 'version', 'refnames', and 'git_hash' store version control info and are hardcoded. The file's structure and content do not indicate any malicious intent or unusual behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated metadata file containing version and source control information. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and shows no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
