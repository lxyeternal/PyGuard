{
  "purpose": "Provides a PostgreSQL connection interface with dynamic driver library location resolution across platforms.",
  "sources": "Filesystem checks for driver library files, import statements for modules like adbc_driver_manager and importlib_resources, and the URI parameter for database connection.",
  "sinks": "The URI parameter used in establishing the database connection; filesystem access for locating driver libraries.",
  "flows": "Filesystem checks determine driver path, which is then used in the AdbcDatabase constructor along with the provided URI.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Filesystem checks are standard for driver loading.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard cross-platform driver library resolution by checking known filesystem locations, then uses the resolved path to establish a database connection. No signs of malicious behavior, secrets, or obfuscation are present. The filesystem checks are routine for dynamic library loading. The overall structure is straightforward and aligns with typical driver management patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured module for establishing PostgreSQL connections with dynamic driver loading. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is evident. The minor risk score of 0.1 reflects the filesystem checks, which are standard and unlikely to be exploited maliciously in this context.",
