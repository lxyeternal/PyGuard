  "purpose": "This script appears to be a setup utility for a Python package, specifically handling library resolution, version extraction, and package setup.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (ADBC_POSTGRESQL_LIBRARY, _ADBC_IS_SDIST, _ADBC_IS_CONDA), filesystem (checking for existing library file), version.py file in the package directory.",
  "sinks": "shutil.copy (copying library file), importlib.util functions (loading version module), setup() function (defining package version).",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> filesystem checks -> copying library file -> loading version.py -> setting up package.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. No obfuscated code. Use of shutil.copy based on environment variable could potentially overwrite files if environment is manipulated, but this is standard for build scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script performs environment variable checks for library paths, resolves the library file, possibly copies a user-provided library file into a target directory, loads version information from a specific file, and then calls setup() with the version. No network activity, no data exfiltration, no command execution beyond standard package setup procedures. The code uses standard libraries and follows typical patterns for package setup. No malicious behavior or sabotage evident. It appears to be a legitimate build script for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, handling library resolution, version extraction, and package setup. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The script performs typical build operations securely.",
