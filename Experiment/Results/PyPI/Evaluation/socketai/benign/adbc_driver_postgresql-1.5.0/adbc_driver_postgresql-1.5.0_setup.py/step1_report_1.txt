  "purpose": "The script is primarily used for setup and configuration of a Python package, resolving dependencies, and retrieving the package version.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (ADBC_POSTGRESQL_LIBRARY, _ADBC_IS_SDIST, _ADBC_IS_CONDA), filesystem (target.so file, _version.py)",
  "sinks": "shutil.copy() function (copies library file), exec_module() (executes code in _version.py)",
  "flows": "Environment variables determine whether to copy library file; get_version loads and executes _version.py to retrieve version info",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors; code is standard setup logic. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment checks and copies a shared library if needed, then loads package version info without executing the entire package. The use of environment variables and file copying is standard for setup scripts. The dynamic import of _version.py is a common pattern. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate setup script for a Python package with standard environment checks and version retrieval. No malicious behavior or malware indicators are present.",
