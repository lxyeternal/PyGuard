  "purpose": "The script is used for setting up a Python package, resolving library paths, and retrieving version information without executing the package code.",
  "sources": "Environment variables ('ADBC_POSTGRESQL_LIBRARY', '_ADBC_IS_SDIST', '_ADBC_IS_CONDA'), filesystem (target library file, '_version.py')",
  "sinks": "shutil.copy(library, target), loading and executing '_version.py'",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence copying or building decisions; loading '_version.py' to extract version info",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or backdoors; legitimate package setup code",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup tasks: managing dependencies via environment variables, copying library files, and extracting version info from a local file. The logic handles different build environments ('sdist', 'conda') and ensures necessary libraries are present. The '_version.py' is loaded dynamically to retrieve version info. There are no signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The use of environment variables and file operations is typical for build scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate setup utility for a Python package, with no indicators of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It handles library dependencies and version retrieval securely and transparently.",
