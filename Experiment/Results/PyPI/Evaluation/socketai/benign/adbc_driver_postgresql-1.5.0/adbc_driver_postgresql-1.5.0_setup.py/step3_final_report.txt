{
  "purpose": "This script performs environment checks, copies a shared library if necessary, and dynamically loads version information for package setup.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'ADBC_POSTGRESQL_LIBRARY', filesystem checks for the shared library, and the '_version.py' file for version info.",
  "sinks": "Copying a library file from a path controlled by an environment variable; executing code from '_version.py'.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'ADBC_POSTGRESQL_LIBRARY' -> shutil.copy() -> shared library; '_version.py' -> exec_module() -> version info.",
  "anomalies": "Copying a library file based on an environment variable, which could be manipulated to inject malicious code; no validation of the library's integrity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup tasks: environment variable checks, file operations, and dynamic import. No malicious code or obfuscation is present. The main concern is that the shared library source is controlled via an environment variable, which could be exploited if an attacker sets this variable to a malicious library path. The dynamic import of '_version.py' is typical and safe if the file is trusted. Overall, the script is benign but contains a potential supply chain attack vector through environment variable manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate setup utility with no evidence of malicious intent. The only notable risk is the environment-controlled copying of a shared library, which could be exploited if environment variables are compromised. The code is straightforward, and no obfuscation is present. The malware score remains 0, but the security risk should be acknowledged as moderate (around 0.4) due to the potential for malicious library injection via environment variables.",
