  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate setup utility with no evidence of malicious intent. The only notable risk is the environment-controlled copying of a shared library, which could be exploited if environment variables are compromised. The code is straightforward, and no obfuscation is present. The malware score remains 0, but the security risk should be acknowledged as moderate (around 0.4) due to the potential for malicious library injection via environment variables."
