{
  "purpose": "The script sets up and resolves dependencies for a Python package, specifically handling shared library files and package versioning.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (ADBC_POSTGRESQL_LIBRARY, _ADBC_IS_SDIST, _ADBC_IS_CONDA), file system (target library path), version file (_version.py).",
  "sinks": "shutil.copy() function copying library files, dynamic import and execution of version module.",
  "flows": "Environment variable ADBC_POSTGRESQL_LIBRARY -> shutil.copy() to target; get_version() reads and executes _version.py -> retrieves __version__",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious dynamic code; standard dependency resolution logic with environment-based conditional behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages setup dependencies and version retrieval. It reads environment variables to determine if a shared library needs to be copied or if certain build conditions are met. The get_version() function dynamically loads a version module from a file, which is a common pattern to avoid executing the entire package. There are no suspicious network calls, data leaks, or malicious code snippets. All operations are standard for setup scripts, involving file system checks, environment variable reads, and dynamic module import. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It manages dependencies and retrieves version info securely without any indication of malware or security risks.",
