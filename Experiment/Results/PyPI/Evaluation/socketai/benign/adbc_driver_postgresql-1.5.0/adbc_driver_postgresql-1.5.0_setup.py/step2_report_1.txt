  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Summary:** The script performs standard setup tasks, environment checks, and version retrieval. No suspicious or malicious code is identified.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.  \n- **Security Risk:** 0 — no evident vulnerabilities.  \n- **Assessment:** This report correctly identifies the script as benign. No issues here.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on standard setup operations and no malicious activity. Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still high.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent with the analysis.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — very minimal, possibly due to the copying of files based on environment variables, but this is typical for build scripts.  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no malicious behavior is evident.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Summary:** Same as above, with high confidence (1.0).  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- **Security Risk:** 0 — standard setup logic.  \n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies the script as legitimate.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Summary:** Highlights a potential vector: copying a library file from a user-controlled environment variable, and executing code from `_version.py`.  \n- **Confidence:** 0.7 — reasonable, given the potential risk.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no explicit malware, but the potential for malicious library injection exists if environment variables are manipulated.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.4 — moderate, due to the environment-controlled file copy.  \n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly notes the potential vector but does not identify actual malicious activity. The risk is real but not confirmed.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to others, standard setup operations, no malicious activity.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — clear code.  \n- **Security Risk:** 0 — standard and safe.  \n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Confirmation:** The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, involving environment checks, file copying, and dynamic version loading. No actual malicious code or backdoors are present.  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is justified.  \n- **Obfuscated:** All reports correctly identify the code as not obfuscated.  \n- **Security Risk:** While some reports note potential risks due to environment-controlled file copying, these are typical in build scripts and do not constitute malicious activity.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Estimated scores based on analysis:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious activity detected or implied.  \n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is straightforward.  \n- **Risk:** **0.1 to 0.2** — minimal, mostly related to potential manipulation of environment variables, but this is standard in build processes and not inherently malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe script is a legitimate setup utility with standard practices. No evidence of malware or malicious intent is present. The potential for misuse exists if environment variables are manipulated, but this is a common risk in build scripts and not indicative of malicious behavior.\n\n**Final notes:**  \nNo changes needed to the existing report scores. They are consistent with the code and the analysis.",
