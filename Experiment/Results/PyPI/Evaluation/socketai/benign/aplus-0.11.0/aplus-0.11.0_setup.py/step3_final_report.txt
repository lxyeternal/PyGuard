  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'aplus' Python package.",
  "sources": "Static strings in the setup() call: name, version, packages, author, author_email.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Static metadata assigned directly to setup() parameters; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup from distutils.core and calls it with static, hardcoded package information. There are no dynamic inputs, network activities, or suspicious behaviors. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard Python packaging practices, albeit using an outdated module. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard Python package setup configuration with no malicious or security issues. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are justified and consistent with the code.",
