  "purpose": "Define the package metadata and setup configuration for distribution using distutils.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded package name, version, author name, and author email within the setup() function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted input or data processing; no external data or user input involved.",
  "flows": "N/A - static metadata assignment without data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual code constructs. Usage of 'distutils' is outdated but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script for Python package distribution, specifying package metadata. No user input, data processing, or network activity occurs. The use of 'distutils.core' instead of 'setuptools' is noted but not suspicious. No signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard package setup file with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It solely defines package metadata for distribution purposes.",
