  "sources": "Reads package metadata such as name, version, packages, author, and email during installation.",
  "sinks": "None observed. No untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only defines metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; uses standard setup pattern with no suspicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal setup script utilizing 'distutils.core.setup' to define package metadata. It does not perform any network operations, data processing, or system modifications beyond package installation configuration. No obfuscated code, no external inputs, and no security-sensitive operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign setup script for distributing a Python package. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
