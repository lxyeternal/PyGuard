  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'aplus' Python module for distribution.",
  "sources": "The script reads metadata about the package such as name, version, packages, author, and author_email.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted input or data; no potential data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "Input data (metadata) is defined statically in the setup() function parameters; no external data flows or untrusted sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code is straightforward and standard for packaging purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' from distutils.core and calls it with static package metadata. No dynamic code execution, no use of untrusted inputs, no hardcoded credentials beyond basic author info, and no suspicious behavior. It appears to be a standard package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for Python packaging with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely defines package metadata for distribution.",
