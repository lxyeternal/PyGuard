  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'aplus' Python module.",
  "sources": "Input source is the setup configuration parameters within the script itself, notably the package name, version, author, and email.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data flows into a security-sensitive operation or potential data leak point.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive operations; the code is purely declarative configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials or secrets, and no dynamic or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script uses the standard 'distutils.core.setup' function to define package metadata. It only contains static configuration data without any user input, network activity, or code execution beyond standard setup declaration. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward package setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be a typical, benign packaging script.",
