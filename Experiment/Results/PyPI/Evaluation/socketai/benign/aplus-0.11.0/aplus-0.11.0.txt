      "conclusion": "The code is benign, implementing standard Promise and concurrency utilities. The main security consideration is the execution of external functions via spawn, which is typical but should be managed carefully in untrusted environments. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The risk scores are justified and align with the code's behavior."
