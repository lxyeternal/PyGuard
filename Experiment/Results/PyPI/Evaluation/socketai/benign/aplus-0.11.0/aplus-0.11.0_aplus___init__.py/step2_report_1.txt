  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: presence of malicious code, logical flaws, consistency of scores, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code implements a Promise system with spawn functions that execute arbitrary functions in threads or greenlets. The main concern is executing user-supplied functions, which could be malicious.\n\n- **Analysis:** No malicious code or backdoors are detected. The only risk is the execution of potentially malicious functions via spawn, which is inherent in such frameworks.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0.3, Obfuscated: 0. \n\n- **Justification:** Since spawn executes arbitrary functions, if those functions are malicious, system compromise is possible. The code itself is benign, but the execution context could be exploited.\n\n**Verdict:** The score aligns with the logic. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is a Promise framework with spawn functions executing arbitrary code.\n\n- **Analysis:** No malicious code detected. The main concern is untrusted callback execution.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0.2, Obfuscated: 0.\n\n- **Justification:** Same reasoning as above; the potential for malicious behavior depends on external inputs, not the code itself.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the Promise implementation and spawn functions that execute arbitrary functions asynchronously.\n\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious code. The only concern is executing untrusted functions, which is standard in such frameworks.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0, Obfuscated: 0.\n\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity detected. The code is a typical async utility.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, highlighting that spawn functions execute arbitrary functions, which could be malicious if untrusted.\n\n- **Analysis:** No malicious code detected. The potential risk is from external functions, not the code itself.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0.3, Obfuscated: 0.\n\n- **Justification:** The reasoning is consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code executes user-defined functions asynchronously, with potential risks if those functions are malicious.\n\n- **Analysis:** No malicious code or backdoors. The main concern is execution of untrusted functions, which is inherent in such design.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0.2, Obfuscated: 0.\n\n- **Justification:** The code is standard, and the potential for malicious activity depends on external inputs, not the code itself.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious code or backdoors are present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 in all cases, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation, mostly around 0.2–0.3, reflecting the inherent risk of executing arbitrary functions supplied externally.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- The core logic of the code is benign, implementing standard Promise and concurrency utilities.\n- The primary security concern is the execution of user-supplied functions via spawn, which could be malicious if misused.\n- No evidence of code obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — moderate, due to execution of external functions, but this is typical for such frameworks.\n\n**Conclusion:** The current reports' scores are reasonable and aligned with the code's behavior. No adjustments necessary.",
