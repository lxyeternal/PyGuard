{
  "purpose": "This code defines Pulumi resource classes for managing Databricks Lakehouse Monitors, including configuration classes and resource initialization logic.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to constructors (__init__ methods) such as assets_dir, table_name, schedule, and other configuration objects; property getters for resource attributes.",
  "sinks": "Property setters that assign values to resource properties; resource initialization (__init__ methods) that set up resource state.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (sources) are passed into constructors and property setters; these values are stored in resource state; getters retrieve stored values for resource attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or sensitive information are present. No code explicitly performs network operations, file system access, or data exfiltration. The comments mention resource management and configuration, with no suspicious or misleading code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a structured class definition for Pulumi resources and their configuration data types, including constructors, property getters/setters, and resource registration logic. It handles resource property assignment and retrieval without executing any dynamic code, network operations, or malicious actions. There are no signs of obfuscation, code injection, or malicious code. The code adheres to expected patterns for defining infrastructure resources. The presence of detailed comments and configuration logic aligns with standard resource management code. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign, well-structured resource definition for managing Databricks Lakehouse Monitors using Pulumi. It contains no malicious intent, backdoors, or harmful behaviors. The code solely defines configuration data types and resource classes without executing any external or harmful actions.",
