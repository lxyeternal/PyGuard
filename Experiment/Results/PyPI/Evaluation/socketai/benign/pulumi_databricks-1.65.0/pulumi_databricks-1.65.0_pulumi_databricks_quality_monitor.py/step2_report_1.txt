  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as Pulumi resource classes for managing Databricks Lakehouse Quality Monitors.\n- They highlight that the code primarily consists of class definitions, property getters/setters, and resource initialization logic.\n- No mention of network activity, file I/O, or dynamic code execution.\n- The code is described as auto-generated, with detailed documentation, type annotations, and standard resource management patterns.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or backdoors are detected.\n- The reports consistently conclude that the code is benign, well-structured, and poses no security risks.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports indicate the code is not obfuscated.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, with minor mention (0.1) possibly due to the auto-generated nature, but no actual vulnerabilities.\n\n**Assessment of logical flaws or suspicious claims:**\n- The reports are thorough and align with the code's content: resource class definitions for infrastructure management.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is cautious and consistent.\n- The code does not perform any external or unsafe operations; it is purely declarative.\n\n**Scores justification:**\n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all appropriately set to 0 or near-zero.\n- Given the absence of any malicious indicators, these scores are reasonable.\n\n**Final conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard Pulumi SDK resource class implementation for managing Databricks Lakehouse Monitors.\n- It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious code.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n---\n\n### My personal estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — negligible, mainly due to auto-generated code, not an actual security concern.\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, benign, and purely infrastructural.",
