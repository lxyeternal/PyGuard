{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes for managing a QualityMonitor resource in Databricks using Pulumi, including arguments, state, and resource creation logic.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to constructors and property getters (e.g., assets_dir, table_name, custom_metrics, inference_log, schedule, snapshot). These are used for configuring the resource.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks found. The code does not perform network operations, data leakage, or system modifications. It primarily sets up resource configurations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into resource properties during initialization. Property getters retrieve configuration values for resource management. No data flows are directed to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "The code is heavily decorated with detailed documentation and type annotations. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments are present. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution is observed. The code appears to be standard resource class definitions with proper validation and property management.",
  "analysis": "The script consists of Pulumi resource classes and argument/state classes for managing Databricks QualityMonitor resources. It performs type validation, sets resource properties, and provides mechanisms to get existing resources. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as network communication, code injection, or data exfiltration. The code is purely infrastructural, focused on resource configuration, with thorough documentation and no hidden or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is standard Pulumi resource class code for managing Databricks monitors. It contains no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is a typical, well-structured infrastructure-as-code class definition.",
