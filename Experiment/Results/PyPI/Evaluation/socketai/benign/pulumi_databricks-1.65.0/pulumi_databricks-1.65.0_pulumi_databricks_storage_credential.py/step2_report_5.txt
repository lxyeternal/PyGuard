  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The report correctly identifies that the code defines Pulumi resource classes and argument structures for managing storage credentials, with data flowing from inputs to resource properties.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external network calls or data exfiltration code are present; data flows are confined within resource property assignments.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code patterns are detected. The code appears to be a standard SDK/resource definition with sensitive data handled via inputs, which is normal.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment is consistent; no malware or malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, it notes resource class implementation, with input parameters for credentials.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No malicious network activity; sensitive data is passed as parameters.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation; the code appears boilerplate and legitimate.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid; no signs of malware.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 are appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, standard resource class definitions with credential parameters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows from user inputs into resource properties; no external calls.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code or obfuscation; code is typical for IaC SDKs.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar resource class with credential handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No network or malicious data handling; data flows are within resource lifecycle.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, standard resource code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines resource classes for storage credentials; standard pattern.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No malicious network activity; data flows from inputs to resource properties.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, secrets hardcoded, or malicious code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code or behavior. Given the code is resource SDK boilerplate, this is expected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; all reports agree.\n- **Risk score:** Slight variation, but generally low, reflecting the potential for sensitive data exposure if misused, but no active malicious behavior.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0** across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** Confirmed as **0**.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly higher than 0 might be justified if sensitive data handling is considered a potential risk, but since no actual leakage or malicious activity is present, keeping them low (around 0.1–0.2) is appropriate.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (due to handling of sensitive credentials but no malicious activity)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, auto-generated Pulumi SDK resource implementation for managing cloud storage credentials in Databricks. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity are present. The handling of sensitive data via inputs is consistent with best practices, and no backdoors or exfiltration mechanisms are evident. The scores given in the reports are reasonable and should remain as they are.",
