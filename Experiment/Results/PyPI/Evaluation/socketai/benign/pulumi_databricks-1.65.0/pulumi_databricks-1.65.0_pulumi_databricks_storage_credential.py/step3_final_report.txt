{
  "purpose": "The code defines Pulumi classes for managing storage credentials in Databricks, handling credential parameters via input properties and resource classes. It facilitates creation, lookup, and management of cloud storage credentials across AWS, Azure, and GCP.",
  "sources": "Input parameters provided during resource instantiation or property setters, including credential details, tokens, keys, and configuration options.",
  "sinks": "Resource properties that store credential data; no external network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user inputs and parameters into resource properties; no external or network activity is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious patterns detected. The code is auto-generated SDK boilerplate with standard patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of resource class definitions with input and output properties for managing cloud storage credentials. It handles sensitive data via parameters, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The structure is typical for Pulumi SDK resources, with clear getter/setter patterns and resource registration. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious logic are present. The code's purpose is to facilitate infrastructure as code management of credentials, not to perform any malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, auto-generated Pulumi SDK resource implementation for managing Databricks storage credentials. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or malicious activity. Handling of sensitive data via inputs aligns with best practices, and no suspicious patterns are evident.",
