  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, data flows, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The report correctly identifies that the code defines Pulumi classes for managing storage credentials, with data flowing from inputs to resource properties.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external network calls or data exfiltration mechanisms are present; data flows are confined to resource property assignments.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The code is auto-generated, with no obfuscated or malicious patterns. Sensitive data (API tokens, keys) are passed as inputs, which is standard in IaC. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are evident.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment that there's no malicious activity, backdoors, or malware is accurate. The malware score of 0 aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 (low, typical IaC risk due to handling of sensitive data)\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard resource class implementation, handling sensitive data via parameters.  \n- No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or backdoors.  \n- The extensive comments and pattern are typical for generated SDK code.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, standard resource management risk)\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Focuses on credential parameters, with no evidence of malicious code or obfuscation.  \n- Data flows are from user inputs into resource properties, with no external network activity.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 (standard IaC handling of secrets, no malicious activity)\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Again, a typical resource class with credential parameters, no signs of malicious intent.  \n- Sensitive data are passed as inputs, with no embedded secrets or suspicious code.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0 (no malicious activity, just resource definitions)\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Similar to others, with standard patterns for resource and input type definitions.  \n- No suspicious code, network activity, or obfuscation detected.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 (normal IaC handling of credentials)\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently show no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, as expected for auto-generated SDK/resource code.  \n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero but low, reflecting the handling of sensitive data, which is typical for infrastructure code but not inherently malicious.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 (standard handling of secrets, no signs of malicious intent)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code appears to be a legitimate, auto-generated Pulumi SDK for managing Databricks storage credentials. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The handling of sensitive data is consistent with best practices in IaC, relying on user inputs and resource properties, with no evidence of malicious activity.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like further analysis or specific focus on any part.",
