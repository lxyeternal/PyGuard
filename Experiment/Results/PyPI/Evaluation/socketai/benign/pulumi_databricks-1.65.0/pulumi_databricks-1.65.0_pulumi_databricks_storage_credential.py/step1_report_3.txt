{
  "purpose": "This code defines Pulumi resource types for managing storage credentials in a cloud environment, specifically for Databricks integrations with AWS, Azure, and GCP.",
  "sources": "Code reads input parameters for resource configuration, such as credentials, IDs, and access modes, from function arguments and class properties.",
  "sinks": "Potential untrusted data flows to resource properties like credentials, IDs, and configuration options that, if maliciously set, could affect resource security or leak information.",
  "flows": "User provides input parameters during resource instantiation which are then assigned to resource properties and used in resource creation or updates, passing data from source inputs to resource configuration endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs detected. The code appears to be standard resource class definitions for Pulumi. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution observed. No embedded network calls or data exfiltration logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for resource arguments and resource creation, following Pulumi conventions. It manages credential parameters for cloud storage access and defines getter/setter properties for resource attributes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. It appears to be boilerplate code generated by Pulumi tools for resource management. The only notable aspect is the presence of numerous credential parameters, which must be provided securely by the user; however, their handling in code is straightforward and appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Pulumi resource class implementation for managing storage credentials in a cloud environment. It does not contain any malicious behavior or sabotage indicators. It is designed for resource configuration and management, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
