{
  "purpose": "The code defines Pulumi resource classes and argument structures for managing storage credentials in Databricks, including various cloud provider authentication methods.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input parameters during resource creation (__init__ methods), property getters, and optional arguments such as aws_iam_role, azure_managed_identity, gcp_service_account_key, etc.",
  "sinks": "The resource properties and arguments could potentially lead to data leaks if sensitive info (like API tokens, keys, roles) are exposed or misused. No explicit data exfiltration code or network connections are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arguments (potentially untrusted) into resource properties and stored configurations. No untrusted data flows directly into network actions or external system calls within this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a warning comment about generated code, but no obfuscated language features, malicious code patterns, or hidden backdoors are evident. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present; all sensitive data are passed as inputs.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions for resource arguments, state, and the resource itself, with properties, getters, and setters for various credential parameters. It uses Pulumi conventions for resource management. There are no network calls, system modifications, or suspicious code blocks. The input parameters include sensitive data but are handled through Pulumi's input system, which relies on user-provided secrets. There are no indicators of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, system compromise, or backdoors. The only potential security concern is the handling of sensitive data through inputs, but this is standard practice and does not indicate malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Pulumi resource implementation for managing Databricks storage credentials. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. It handles sensitive data via inputs and properties, consistent with infrastructure-as-code practices. No malicious activity or sabotage is detected.",
