  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes Pulumi classes and functions to generate/retrieve AWS cross-account IAM policies for Databricks, based on input parameters and Pulumi's invoke API.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows from parameters into Pulumi API calls, returning policy JSONs and resource identifiers.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code constructs, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation. Uses Pulumi SDK as intended.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate infrastructure code, no malware, low security risk (0.1), high confidence (0.95).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard Pulumi pattern, input validation, and safe data retrieval.\n- No malicious activity, no obfuscation, and standard SDK usage.\n- Security risk is slightly higher (0.2) but still very low, with high confidence (0.9).\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Continues the pattern: resource classes, functions invoking Pulumi APIs, no signs of malicious behavior.\n- No suspicious data handling or code obfuscation.\n- Security risk 0.2, confidence 0.9.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Reiterates that the code is auto-generated Pulumi resource code, with no malicious indicators.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- Security risk 0.2, confidence 0.9.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same pattern: data classes, Pulumi API calls, no malicious activity.\n- Very low security risk (0.1), high confidence (0.95).\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Synthesis:\n- **Code Presence & Functionality:** All reports confirm that the code is a standard Pulumi SDK-based module for managing AWS cross-account IAM policies in a Databricks context.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** None of the reports find any obfuscated code, malicious logic, or backdoors. The code is straightforward, generated by Pulumi tools, with proper input validation.\n- **Potential Vulnerabilities:** The only concern might be the use of Pulumi's invoke functions which, if the provider were malicious, could potentially leak data or perform unintended actions. However, these are standard SDK functions, and the code does not manipulate data beyond expected API calls.\n- **Security Risks:** Given the code's purpose—interacting with cloud APIs for resource management—and the absence of any suspicious patterns, the security risk remains very low.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (very low, standard infrastructure code)\n\nThis aligns with the nature of the code being auto-generated SDK resource definitions for cloud infrastructure management.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, auto-generated Pulumi module for managing AWS cross-account IAM policies for Databricks. It performs expected operations with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nMaintain a malware score of **0**, obfuscated **0**, and risk score **0.1**. No further action needed based on this review.",
