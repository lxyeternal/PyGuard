{
  "purpose": "The code defines functions and classes to retrieve AWS cross-account policies for Databricks, primarily for infrastructure configuration and automation.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for functions (e.g., aws_account_id, aws_partition, pass_roles, etc.), environment variables, and module imports.",
  "sinks": "Data returned by Pulumi invoke functions, which may include sensitive information such as policy JSONs and account identifiers.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used in function calls to invoke Pulumi's backend API; the responses are processed and returned as structured objects containing policy data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code appears to strictly perform data retrieval and object construction based on external API calls. No use of dynamic code execution, obfuscated patterns, or unusual behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Pulumi Python module for infrastructure as code, using type hints, Pulumi resource types, and invoke functions to gather cloud configuration data. It includes input validation for parameters and constructs response objects accordingly. There are no indications of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors. The use of Pulumi's SDK functions suggests intended cloud resource management rather than malicious code. The initial comments warn about code generation but do not suggest malicious intent. Overall, the code is standard for infrastructure automation with no suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate Pulumi infrastructure module designed to retrieve AWS cross-account policies for Databricks. It performs input validation and uses Pulumi APIs appropriately. No malicious code, backdoors, or malware indicators are present. The security risk is low.",
