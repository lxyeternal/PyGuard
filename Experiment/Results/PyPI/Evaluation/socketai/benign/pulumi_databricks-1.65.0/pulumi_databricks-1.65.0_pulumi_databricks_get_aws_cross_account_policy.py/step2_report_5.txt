  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its behavior, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a Pulumi module for retrieving AWS cross-account IAM policies for Databricks.\n- The code is generated by a Pulumi Terraform bridge tool, which is common in infrastructure as code.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns are identified: no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no network activity beyond Pulumi SDK calls, and no data exfiltration.\n- The code performs standard input validation, resource invocation, and property accessors.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code matches the description: it uses Pulumi's invoke functions to retrieve policy data.\n- No anomalies or malicious behaviors are present.\n- The code is consistent with typical Pulumi SDK patterns.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- The reports are accurate; the code appears correct and legitimate.\n- The only minor point is that the code is auto-generated, which is noted, but this does not indicate a flaw.\n\n### Score assessments:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code being straightforward and generated, not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** All reports give low scores (~0.1–0.2), which aligns with the low security risk observed.\n\n### Justifications:\n- No reason to adjust scores upward; the code is safe.\n- The highest risk score is 0.2, which is reasonable given the code's function and context.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** (low, due to the nature of the code being infrastructure management, not security vulnerability)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, auto-generated Pulumi module for managing AWS cross-account policies in the context of Databricks. It performs no malicious actions, contains no obfuscation, and has minimal security risk.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nNo changes needed to the scores. The code is safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
