  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as auto-generated Pulumi modules for managing AWS cross-account IAM policies in the context of Databricks.\n- The code performs input validation, uses Pulumi's invoke functions to retrieve data, and exposes properties for accessing policy details.\n- No suspicious code constructs, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are indicated.\n- The reports consistently conclude that the code is legitimate, with very low security risks and no malware signs.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears syntactically correct, with proper type checks and Pulumi API usage.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Security risks:** Low, mostly related to the inherent trust in Pulumi's SDK and external provider APIs, which is standard.\n\n### Specific points:\n- The code is typical for Pulumi infrastructure as code, generating resource definitions and fetching data via Pulumi's invoke functions.\n- No hardcoded secrets, network calls to suspicious domains, or dynamic code execution are observed.\n- The code comments mention code generation but do not suggest malicious obfuscation or payloads.\n\n### Scores assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis. No signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** Very low (around 0.1-0.2), justified by the code's purpose and the use of trusted SDKs.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports suggest any activity that warrants a high risk score.\n- The only potential concern is the reliance on external APIs, but this is standard for infrastructure code and not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nBased on the detailed reviews, the code is a standard Pulumi module for managing AWS cross-account policies with Databricks. It performs input validation, uses Pulumi SDK functions appropriately, and does not exhibit any malicious or obfuscated behavior.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, generated code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, inherent to infrastructure code relying on external SDKs)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is safe, legitimate, and intended for cloud infrastructure automation. No modifications to the scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always ensure external SDKs and providers are from trusted sources, but in this context, Pulumi's SDK is well-known and trusted for infrastructure management.",
