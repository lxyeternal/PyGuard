{
  "purpose": "The code defines Pulumi resource types and functions to generate AWS cross-account IAM policies for Databricks, with no indication of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions such as get_aws_cross_account_policy and get_aws_cross_account_policy_output, which read configuration data like account ID, region, and security group ID.",
  "sinks": "Use of pulumi.runtime.invoke and pulumi.get to retrieve data from external providers, which could potentially be manipulated if the provider is malicious, but this is standard for Pulumi resource invocations.",
  "flows": "Parameters flow from user input to provider invocation functions, and retrieved data flows back into resource result objects, with no suspicious data manipulation or untrusted data handling beyond standard resource management.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code mainly performs type checks, resource definition, and data retrieval through Pulumi's SDK, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Pulumi provider resource module, defining data classes and functions to interact with AWS and Databricks APIs. It includes type validation, resource result encapsulation, and standard invoke patterns. No signs of obfuscated code, hidden payloads, or malicious behavior are present. All external interactions occur through official Pulumi SDK functions designed for resource provisioning. There are no suspicious data exfiltration points or malicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate Pulumi module for managing AWS cross-account IAM policies in the context of Databricks. It does not contain malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware indications. The code's structure and functionality align with expected resource management tasks, with no malicious signals.",
