  "purpose": "This code defines Pulumi resource classes and functions to retrieve AWS cross-account IAM policies for Databricks, facilitating infrastructure automation through Pulumi SDK calls.",
  "sources": "Inputs such as aws_account_id, aws_partition, pass_roles, policy_type, region, security_group_id, vpc_id; Pulumi invoke functions fetching data from cloud provider APIs.",
  "sinks": "Data flows from input parameters into Pulumi API calls, with responses processed into resource property objects.",
  "flows": "Input parameters → Pulumi invoke functions → Response data → Resource property accessors.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, suspicious network activity, or unusual code constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is auto-generated Pulumi resource code for managing AWS IAM policies, with standard input validation and API calls. It does not contain malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security flaws. The code relies on Pulumi SDK functions for data retrieval, with no suspicious data handling or dynamic code execution. The scores assigned across reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's purpose and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, safe, and intended for cloud infrastructure management. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present. The current scores are appropriate and should remain unchanged.",
