{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions and classes to generate and retrieve AWS cross-account IAM policies for use with Pulumi and Databricks, primarily to facilitate cloud infrastructure provisioning and management.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions (`get_aws_cross_account_policy`, `get_aws_cross_account_policy_output`) including AWS account IDs, regions, security group IDs, and VPC IDs; data fetched via Pulumi's invoke methods; properties of the defined classes.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the invocation of Pulumi's `invoke` and `invoke_output` functions which generate and return policy JSON documents, and property accessors that retrieve resource identifiers and policy data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into Pulumi invocation calls, which retrieve or generate policy data, then are passed through output objects and properties, with the JSON policy data ultimately accessible via class properties.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard Pulumi resource definitions and utility functions for infrastructure as code; no unusual code constructs, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, and no obfuscated code. The warning comment indicates code generation origin, but this is normal for Pulumi-generated code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes and functions for interacting with Pulumi to generate AWS IAM policies related to cross-account access, utilizing Pulumi's `invoke` functions to retrieve data based on input parameters. The code performs type checks on inputs and safely manages output data. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network operations, or malicious logic are present. It is designed for legitimate infrastructure management. The presence of generated code and standard property accessors suggests a typical Pulumi SDK pattern, not malicious obfuscation or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Pulumi-generated resource interaction script for managing AWS cross-account policies. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It functions as intended for cloud infrastructure automation without any suspicious or harmful activity.",
