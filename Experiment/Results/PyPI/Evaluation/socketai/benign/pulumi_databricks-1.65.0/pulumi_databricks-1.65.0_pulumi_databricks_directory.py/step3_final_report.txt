  "purpose": "Auto-generated Pulumi resource module for managing Databricks directories, defining input parameters and resource properties.",
  "sources": "Constructor arguments for directory path, delete_recursive, object_id; property getters retrieving internal state.",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission, no network activity, no data leaks, no embedded secrets.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into resource properties; getters retrieve internal state; no external or malicious data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "Standard boilerplate code, auto-generated, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code segments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Pulumi resource class for managing directories, with input types, property accessors, and resource retrieval functions. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external network activity. The initial comment indicates auto-generation, which aligns with the observed patterns. The code performs resource management tasks without any embedded secrets, data exfiltration, or suspicious logic. The low malware and security risk scores are justified given the nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, auto-generated Pulumi resource module for managing Databricks directories. It contains no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low risk scores and absence of suspicious patterns confirm its benign nature.",
