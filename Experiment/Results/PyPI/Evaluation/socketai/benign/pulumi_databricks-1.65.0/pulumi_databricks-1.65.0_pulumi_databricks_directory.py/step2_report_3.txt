  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to determine if there are any signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Summary:**\n- **Purpose:** Auto-generated Pulumi resource code for managing Databricks directories.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, standard resource management.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (low).\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies that the code is boilerplate, auto-generated, and performs standard resource management. No suspicious code, external network activity, or malicious logic is evident. The low security risk score aligns with this.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Summary:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, defining Pulumi resource classes.\n- **Findings:** No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior; standard patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the code appears to be straightforward resource definitions. No suspicious patterns or malicious indicators are present. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Summary:**\n- **Purpose:** Resource classes for managing directories, including input and state management.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or external data leaks.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis is consistent; the code is standard, auto-generated, with no malicious behavior. The very low security risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Summary:**\n- **Purpose:** Defines Pulumi resource types for Databricks directories.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, boilerplate code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly concludes that the code is boilerplate, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The zero security risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Summary:**\n- **Purpose:** Standard resource class definitions.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior, no external calls, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe code is typical infrastructure as code, with no malicious indicators. The risk score, while slightly higher than zero, remains low and justified given the context.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, and I concur. The code is standard resource management code with no malicious payloads or behaviors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is correct. The code is clear, auto-generated, and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation, but all are low (0.1-0.2). Given the code's nature, this is appropriate.\n\n### Final Justified Assessment:\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Code is clear and auto-generated.\n- **Risk:** **0.1-0.2** — Very low, consistent with infrastructure code.\n\n**Note:** The code is a typical auto-generated Pulumi resource module for managing Databricks directories. It performs resource management tasks without any signs of malicious intent or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis supply chain dependency, based on the provided code and reports, appears safe and free from malware or obfuscation. The low risk scores are justified. No further action needed.",
