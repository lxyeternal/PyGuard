  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, the presence of any issues, and the appropriateness of their scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as auto-generated Pulumi resource definitions for Databricks directories, focusing on input parameters and property accessors.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No evidence of data leaks or external data transmission; data flows are typical for resource management.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The report notes the auto-generated nature and absence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately concludes the code is benign with high confidence (0.9). Malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, and security risk is low (0.2).\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is accurate. The code is standard, auto-generated resource management code with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states that the code defines Pulumi resource classes for Databricks directories.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No dangerous data sinks or external operations are present.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Recognizes the boilerplate nature and the auto-generated origin, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid conclusion with high confidence (0.9). Malware score is 0.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's reasoning is sound. The code is typical infrastructure code, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes resource classes and input parameters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks or external system interactions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Notes the code is standard, generated, with no suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly states it's legitimate infrastructure code with high confidence (0.9). Malware score is 0.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is appropriate and well-justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as auto-generated Pulumi resource definitions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or unsafe data flows detected.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Recognizes the boilerplate, generated nature, and absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid conclusion, high confidence (0.9). Malware score is 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes resource creation and lookup.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No unsafe data sinks or external operations.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Notes the code is standard, generated, with no suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriate conclusion, high confidence (0.9). Malware score is 0.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports agree that the code is auto-generated Pulumi resource definitions for managing Databricks directories.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of malware or obfuscation in any report.\n- **Security Risks:** Very low, as the code is standard resource management code without external calls or sensitive data handling.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, with security risks also very low. The confidence levels are appropriate given the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.2 (consistent with the low security risk and generated nature)  \n\nThe code appears to be a typical, auto-generated infrastructure-as-code resource definition with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n**Conclusion:** No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risk beyond the minimal, expected for auto-generated resource code.",
