  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code is a typical auto-generated Pulumi resource module for managing Databricks directories, with input parameters and property accessors.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows from constructor args into resource properties; property getters retrieve internal state.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no external network activity, credentials, or malicious logic. The warning indicates auto-generation, which is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious behavior; standard resource code. Confidence: 0.9. Malware: 0. Obfuscated: 0. Security risk: 0.2 (a low, acceptable level for infrastructure code).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing boilerplate resource class definitions, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard pattern, no suspicious code, no external data leaks.\n- **Confidence & Scores:** Same as above. Malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on resource class implementation, with input parameters and getters.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, no external network activity. Clearly auto-generated code.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar pattern, standard resource class for Databricks directories.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity, no obfuscation, no external data leaks.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same as others: resource class with input parameters, getters, and resource retrieval functions.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, no suspicious external activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Presence of Malware:** All reports indicate the code is a standard, auto-generated Pulumi resource module for managing Databricks directories.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; code is clear, boilerplate, and generated by Pulumi's tooling.\n- **Security Risks:** Very low; typical infrastructure as code with no external network calls, no embedded secrets, no code injections, or suspicious behaviors.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is purely infrastructure management code, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- The initial warning comment about auto-generation aligns with the observed patterns.\n- No suspicious data flows, external communications, or obfuscated code segments are present.\n- The low malware and security risk scores are justified.\n\n### Suggested Adjusted Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 (confirmed no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (minimal, typical for auto-generated resource code)\n\n**In conclusion**, this code is a standard, auto-generated Pulumi resource module for managing Databricks directories, with no malicious or security issues detected.",
