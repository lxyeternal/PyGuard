{
  "purpose": "The code defines Pulumi resources and input types for managing directories in Databricks workspace, enabling infrastructure as code.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'path', 'delete_recursive', 'object_id', and 'workspace_path'; property getters and setters; resource initialization methods.",
  "sinks": "Resource creation and retrieval functions, especially within '__internal_init' and 'get' methods, which may send or store input data; property accessors that could expose internal state.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into resource properties during creation and update; getters retrieve stored state; resource initialization and 'get' method pass data to Pulumi backend.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a warning comment indicating it was auto-generated by Pulumi Terraform Bridge. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity is evident. Use of standard Pulumi patterns and typical resource management code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Pulumi resource definition for managing directories in Databricks, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious behavior. It utilizes standard patterns for defining input types, resource classes, and property accessors. The presence of a generation warning suggests it was auto-generated and intended for resource management only. No code injections, external data exfiltration, or suspicious external communications are present. All operations appear to be standard infrastructure management tasks with no embedded malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard auto-generated Pulumi resource module for Databricks directories. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data leaks, and no malware. The code performs resource management functions in a typical manner without evident security issues.",
