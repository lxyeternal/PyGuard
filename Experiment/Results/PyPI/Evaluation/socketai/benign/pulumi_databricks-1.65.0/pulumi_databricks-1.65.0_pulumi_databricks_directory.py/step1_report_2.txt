{
  "purpose": "This code defines Pulumi resource classes for managing directories in Databricks workspace, including input types, resource initialization, and lookup functionalities.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration data such as directory path, delete_recursive flag, object_id, and workspace_path from class constructors, properties, and resource arguments.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive properties like 'path', 'object_id', 'delete_recursive', and 'workspace_path' could be used in resource management operations but there are no direct sinks leading to data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "Input sources (constructor parameters, property setters) flow into resource initialization, with no evidence of untrusted data flow to dangerous sinks like network or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code is largely boilerplate for resource class definitions with no signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or unusual logic. The warning at the top indicates the file is generated by a tool, which is normal. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines Pulumi resource types for managing directories, including input argument classes and resource classes with standard patterns for property getters, setters, and resource retrieval. It does not perform any data manipulation beyond setting and retrieving properties. No dynamic code execution, network access, or security-sensitive operations are detected. The presence of generated code and structured resource management suggests this is boilerplate code for infrastructure as code, not malicious. The initial warning clarifies the code is auto-generated, reducing suspicion of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, auto-generated Pulumi resource definition for managing directories in Databricks workspace, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It functions as intended for infrastructure management without performing any harmful operations.",
