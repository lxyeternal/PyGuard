{
  "purpose": "The code defines Pulumi resource classes for managing directories in a Databricks workspace, including input types, resource initialization, and state management.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for directory path, delete_recursive, object_id, and workspace_path; internal resource creation methods.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive properties like object_id, directory path, and workspace_path; no evident data leaks or external data transmission points.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into resource creation and state management, with properties retrieved via Pulumi's get method; no untrusted data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns; the code appears to be a standard resource class implementation with clear comments and structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Pulumi resource class implementation for managing directories within Databricks, including input definitions, resource instantiation, and getter properties. It contains no dynamic code execution, obfuscated parts, or external data transmissions. The code's structure and comments suggest autogenerated code from Pulumi's tooling, with no signs of malicious intent. All data handling is consistent with resource management and no anomalies like hardcoded secrets or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate, autogenerated Pulumi resource class for managing Databricks directories. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code functions as expected for resource definition and management without any suspicious or malicious elements.",
