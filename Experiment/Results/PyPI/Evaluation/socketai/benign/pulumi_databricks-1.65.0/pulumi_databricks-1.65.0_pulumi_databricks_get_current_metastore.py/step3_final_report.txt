{
  "purpose": "Auto-generated Pulumi module for retrieving Databricks metastore information, performing data validation, and API invocation to fetch metadata.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'id' and 'metastore_info'; Pulumi API calls via pulumi.runtime.invoke and invoke_output.",
  "sinks": "Data returned via pulumi.get and pulumi.apply; no untrusted data sinks or external data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Input parameters → validation and assignment → Pulumi API invocation → returned structured result → apply functions for output processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns; standard API usage and data validation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, auto-generated Pulumi SDK resource module for Databricks metastores. It performs input validation, invokes Pulumi's API to retrieve metadata, and structures the output. No malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The malware score is 0, reflecting no malicious intent. The security risk score is low (0.2), consistent with reliance on external APIs and infrastructure management, which is typical for such code. The confidence score is high (above 0.9), given the straightforward, well-understood pattern and lack of suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard SDK code for managing Databricks metastores, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with its purpose and structure.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
