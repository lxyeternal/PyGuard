  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Auto-generated Pulumi code for fetching Databricks metastore info.\n- Findings: No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, standard API calls, input validation present.\n- Malware Score: 0\n- Security Risk: 0.2 (low, due to reliance on Pulumi's API)\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar resource retrieval code for Databricks metastores.\n- Findings: No suspicious code, no backdoors, standard Pulumi SDK usage.\n- Malware Score: 0\n- Security Risk: 0\n- Confidence: 1\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Pulumi module for metastore info retrieval.\n- Findings: No malicious logic, no obfuscation, standard API invocation.\n- Malware Score: 0\n- Security Risk: 0.2\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Infrastructure code for Databricks metastore info.\n- Findings: No signs of malicious activity, standard API calls, no secrets.\n- Malware Score: 0\n- Security Risk: 0.2\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Pulumi-generated code for managing Databricks metastores.\n- Findings: No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, standard patterns.\n- Malware Score: 0\n- Security Risk: 0\n- Confidence: 0.95\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None of the reports identify any malicious logic, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code is standard for Pulumi SDK-generated resource modules.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports agree the code is straightforward, auto-generated, and non-obfuscated.\n- **Malware score:** Consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.2) in most reports, justified by the fact that the code interacts with cloud APIs and potentially sensitive metadata. However, these are inherent to the nature of infrastructure code, not indicative of malicious intent.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the code is read as a standard SDK module.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- The code is a typical Pulumi provider module for Databricks, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- The malware score should remain at 0.\n- The security risk score can stay low (~0.2), reflecting the inherent risk in API interactions but not malicious intent.\n- The confidence in this assessment is high (>0.9).\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my own estimate:**\n\n| Malware Score | Obfuscated | Risk Score |\n|-----------------|--------------|------------|\n| **0**          | **0**       | **0.2**  |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus among the reports.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, standard, and non-malicious. No adjustments needed based on the provided reports.",
