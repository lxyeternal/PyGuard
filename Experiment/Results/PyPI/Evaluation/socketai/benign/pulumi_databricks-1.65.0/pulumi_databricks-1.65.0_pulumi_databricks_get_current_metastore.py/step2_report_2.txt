  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, scoring consistency, and potential security implications.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is an auto-generated Pulumi module for fetching Databricks metastore info. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are identified.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.  \n  The low risk score seems appropriate given the benign nature of the code, but perhaps slightly conservative. The malware score of 0 aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Justification:** The report's reasoning is sound. No suspicious patterns or malicious intent are evident.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. The code is a standard Pulumi data source module with no security concerns.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the code's role in retrieving metadata without malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n  The risk score is even lower here, which is reasonable. No malware or obfuscation detected.\n- **Justification:** Correct. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. No security issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Same as above, highlighting the standard nature of the code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.  \n  Slightly higher risk score, but still low, reflecting the benign analysis.\n- **Justification:** Appropriate, given the code's typical API interaction pattern.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the standard API invocation pattern, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.  \n  Consistent with prior assessments.\n- **Justification:** Correct. No malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Reinforces the benign, generated nature of the code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n  Appropriate given the code's straightforward API calls.\n- **Justification:** Well-founded.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior, so a malware score of 0 is justified.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; 0 is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly conservative but reasonable, given the code's function as an API wrapper. The scores of 0.2 or 0 are acceptable.\n\n### Final expert estimation:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and generated.\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 — minimal security risk, primarily due to reliance on external APIs and infrastructure management, which is standard.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent, accurate, and justified. The code is a benign, auto-generated Pulumi module for managing Databricks metastores, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
