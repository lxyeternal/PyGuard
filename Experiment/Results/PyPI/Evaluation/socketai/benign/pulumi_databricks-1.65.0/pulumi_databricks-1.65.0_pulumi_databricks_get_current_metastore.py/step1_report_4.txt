{
  "purpose": "The code defines functions and classes to retrieve information about a databricks metastore attached to a workspace, primarily for infrastructure management and automation.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions (id, metastore_info), environment variables via pulumi, and external API calls through pulumi.runtime.invoke and invoke_output.",
  "sinks": "The API call via pulumi.runtime.invoke and invoke_output could potentially transmit data to external services; however, this is standard for infrastructure code. No sensitive data is directly written or transmitted within the code itself.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are passed to the invoke functions, which then perform external API calls; the responses are processed and returned as Pulumi output objects. No untrusted data is processed without validation, and the data flow appears straightforward.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be auto-generated, indicated by comments; there are no hardcoded secrets, suspicious logic, or backdoors. The code performs typical API invocation and data encapsulation routines without unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of Pulumi data sources for managing and retrieving databricks metastore information. It uses typical patterns such as input validation, API invocation, and output wrapping. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious network activity. The only external interactions are standard API calls through Pulumi's runtime, which are expected for this purpose. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard auto-generated Pulumi data source module intended for infrastructure automation. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks beyond normal API call operations. It is safe and aligns with typical infrastructure-as-code practices.",
