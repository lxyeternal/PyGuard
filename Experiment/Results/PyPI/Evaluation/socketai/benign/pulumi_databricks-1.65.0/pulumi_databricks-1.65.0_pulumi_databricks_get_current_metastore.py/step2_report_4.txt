  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, assessing the reasoning, and ensuring consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is an auto-generated Pulumi module for fetching Databricks metastore info. It performs input validation, invokes Pulumi's API, and returns structured data. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — a low but non-zero risk, possibly considering the reliance on Pulumi APIs which, if compromised, could expose data.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high confidence that the code is benign.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No issues found, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, confirming standard Pulumi resource code for Databricks metastores. No suspicious behaviors or obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — no significant risks identified.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — absolute confidence.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is thorough and justified. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard Pulumi provider code for Databricks, with proper validation and API calls. No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — similar low risk as previous reports.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high confidence.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues or anomalies. The reasoning is consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a typical Pulumi data source module for Databricks metastores. No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — consistent with previous assessments.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high confidence.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern: generated Pulumi SDK code for resource management, no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — no concerns.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95 — very high confidence.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is thorough and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- **Code Presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is auto-generated Pulumi SDK code for Databricks metastores.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Security Risks:** Slightly conservative with a score of 0.2, considering the reliance on Pulumi's API, which is standard and not inherently malicious.\n- **Confidence Levels:** High across all reports, justified by the code's straightforward, auto-generated nature.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected or implied.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear, auto-generated, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 to 0.2 — minimal, mostly considering the API reliance, but not a security concern.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is standard, benign Pulumi SDK code for managing Databricks metastores, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.",
