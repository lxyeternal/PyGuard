  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is auto-generated Pulumi code for fetching Databricks metastore info. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected. The malware score is 0, and security risk is low (0.2).\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is standard Pulumi SDK code, performing data validation and API calls without malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0 is appropriate. Security risk at 0.2 is acceptable given the reliance on Pulumi's APIs, which could be compromised but isn't evident here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the standard nature of the code, with no suspicious activity or obfuscation. Malware score remains 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No signs of malicious code or backdoors.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0 is appropriate; security risk remains low.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard Pulumi resource code with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The code is typical for cloud resource management.\n\n- **Assessment:** Valid. No malicious activity or hidden backdoors.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, security risk = 0.2, consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard Pulumi code for API calls, no malicious intent, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets. The API interactions are typical.\n\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious behaviors detected.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, security risk = 0.2.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, standard Pulumi-generated code with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The API calls are legitimate.\n\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, security risk = 0.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the analysis. The code is standard SDK code, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, which is correct; the code is clear and auto-generated, not obfuscated.\n\n- **Risk scores:** Set at 0.2 in most reports, which seems to be a conservative baseline for infrastructure code that interacts with external APIs. Given the nature of the code, this is reasonable.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware risk:** **0** — No malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected.\n\n- **Obfuscation:** **0** — The code is clear, auto-generated, with no obfuscation.\n\n- **Security risk:** **0.2** — Slightly elevated due to reliance on Pulumi's APIs, which, if compromised, could lead to data exposure, but this is inherent to the framework, not the code itself.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard Pulumi SDK module for Databricks, with no malicious or suspicious features. The assigned scores reflect this appropriately.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated:** **0**  \n- **Risk:** **0.2**  \n\nThese are aligned with the analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No changes needed; the assessments are justified and consistent with the code's purpose and structure.",
