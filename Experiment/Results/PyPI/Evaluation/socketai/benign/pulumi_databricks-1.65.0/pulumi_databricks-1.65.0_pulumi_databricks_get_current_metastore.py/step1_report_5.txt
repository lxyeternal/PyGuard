{
  "purpose": "This code provides a Python interface for retrieving metadata about a Databricks metastore associated with a workspace, using Pulumi for infrastructure as code.",
  "sources": "Reads include input parameters for functions (`id`, `metastore_info`) and Pulumi's internal data retrieval (`pulumi.get`, `pulumi.runtime.invoke`, `pulumi.invoke_output`).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve Pulumi's invoke functions which access external API data, but these are standard for infrastructure management; no data leaks or untrusted command executions are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters to Pulumi invoke calls, then outputs are wrapped or returned as Pulumi outputs or results, with no untrusted data execution or malicious data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected. The code is straightforward, generated by a known tool (Pulumi). No hidden or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a generated API wrapper for Pulumi's Databricks provider. It performs standard input validation, uses Pulumi's API calls to fetch metadata, and exposes this data via class properties and functions. There are no signs of malicious code such as network connections, file modifications, or data exfiltration. The code's structure and imports are typical for Pulumi SDK-generated modules. No anomalies or suspicious behavior are detected. External API calls are legitimate for infrastructure management, and no secrets or credentials are hardcoded. Overall, the code is benign and standard for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, generated Pulumi SDK module for querying Databricks workspace metastores. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It functions as a safe, infrastructure-as-code utility.",
