{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Pulumi-based Python module for managing and retrieving metadata about Databricks metastores, including functions to get current metastore info and classes to handle the results.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters such as 'id' and 'metastore_info' from function arguments and property decorators, and it imports modules like 'pulumi', 'pulumi.runtime', and 'sys'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not directly write to files, execute commands, or send data over the network. It relies on Pulumi's runtime for cloud resource management. No evident sinks handle untrusted data in a potentially malicious way.",
  "flows": "Input parameters ('id', 'metastore_info') are passed into functions; these are then processed and passed into Pulumi's runtime.invoke functions, which perform cloud resource queries and return results. The data flow is limited to resource management operations without external data leakage.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for a Pulumi resource provider module. There are no hardcoded secrets, suspicious code constructs, or obfuscated code. No backdoors or unusual behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Pulumi resource definition for managing Databricks metastores. It employs type annotations, property getters, and function wrappers to facilitate resource data retrieval. It uses Pulumi's invoke mechanism for cloud API calls, which is standard. No external network calls beyond the expected cloud API interactions are visible, and no potentially malicious logic or obfuscated patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Pulumi provider module for Databricks metastores, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It operates within expected parameters for cloud resource management. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or security issues are detected.",
