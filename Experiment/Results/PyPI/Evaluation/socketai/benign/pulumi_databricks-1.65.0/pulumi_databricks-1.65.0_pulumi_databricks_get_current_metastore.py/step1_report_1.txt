{
  "purpose": "Define functions and classes to retrieve and handle metadata about a databricks workspace metastore using Pulumi infrastructure as code framework.",
  "sources": "Code reads function parameters, Pulumi's invoke functions, and properties of classes for data retrieval.",
  "sinks": "Potentially insecure use of Pulumi's invoke functions that could expose sensitive metadata if misused, but no direct data leaks or malicious data handling are evident.",
  "flows": "Parameters (id, metastore_info) flow into Pulumi invoke calls; retrieved data flows back into objects and properties for further use.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code structures, or obfuscated code. The code is primarily auto-generated and follows typical Pulumi patterns. No signs of malicious backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be an auto-generated Pulumi data source module for fetching metastore details from Databricks. It performs data validation, invokes Pulumi's runtime methods to retrieve resource info, and returns structured result objects. The use of Pulumi's invoke functions is standard for infrastructure management and does not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are identified. The code is well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation or hidden malicious logic. The only potential concern is reliance on Pulumi's APIs which, if compromised, could lead to data leaks, but this is inherent to the framework, not the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, auto-generated Pulumi resource data source for managing Databricks metastores. It performs expected operations without any malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks within the provided fragment.",
