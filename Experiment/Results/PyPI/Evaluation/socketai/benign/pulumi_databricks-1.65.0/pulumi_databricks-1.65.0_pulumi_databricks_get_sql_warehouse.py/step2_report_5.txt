  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to identify any inconsistencies, potential issues, or signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a generated Pulumi module for managing Databricks SQL warehouses. It performs type checks, uses Pulumi's invoke/get functions, and exposes resource attributes via properties. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior is evident.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n  Justified: No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code is standard SDK-generated resource management code.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1  \n  Justified: Very low, as it’s just resource data retrieval without any external system modifications or data exfiltration.\n\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues. The code appears safe, standard, and well-structured.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it describes a resource data retrieval module with no signs of malicious behavior. Uses Pulumi's invoke and get mechanisms, with type safety and no suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n  Justified: No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no malicious code.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0  \n  Justified: No evident security risks.\n\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Conclusion:** Fully legitimate, standard Pulumi SDK code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a resource management module for Databricks SQL warehouses, with no signs of malicious activity. Uses Pulumi's SDK functions, with proper data handling.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n  Justified: No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0  \n  Justified: No security issues detected.\n\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Conclusion:** Safe, standard, generated code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports—standard resource data retrieval code, no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n  Justified: No malicious patterns.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2  \n  Justified: Slightly higher, but still minimal. No external modifications or secret leaks are present.\n\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Conclusion:** No malicious intent, safe for use.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a typical Pulumi data source for Databricks SQL warehouses, with no suspicious behavior. The code is generated, with standard patterns.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n  Justified: No signs of malware.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0  \n  Justified: No security issues.\n\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Conclusion:** Legitimate, safe code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** All reports confirm that the code is a standard, generated Pulumi SDK module for managing Databricks resources. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected.\n\n- **Malware and Obfuscation:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the analysis. The code is straightforward, uses Pulumi's SDK, and contains no signs of malicious payloads.\n\n- **Security Risks:** The minimal risk scores (mostly 0 or 0.2) are justified, as the code only interacts with cloud APIs and resource attributes.\n\n- **Potential Assumptions:** The reports do not assume any malicious intent beyond the code’s functionality. They correctly identify the code as auto-generated, with no signs of sabotage.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Scores:** The assigned scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n- **Risk Estimation:** Given the detailed analysis, I concur that the malware score should remain at 0, obfuscated at 0, and overall security risk at or near 0.\n\n- **Additional Notes:** Since the code is generated and interacts solely with Pulumi and Databricks APIs, the likelihood of malicious activity is negligible.\n\n---\n\n**Final Verdict:**  \n**The code is safe, standard, and free of malicious intent. The scores assigned are appropriate.**",
