{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes and functions for retrieving and managing Databricks SQL warehouse information via Pulumi SDK. It handles resource data retrieval, property access, and resource invocation, with no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Parameters passed to functions, resource attribute getters, and Pulumi's invoke/get mechanisms.",
  "sinks": "Data flows into Pulumi resource properties and returned objects; no external or untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into Pulumi invoke calls; retrieved data flows into resource attribute properties and return objects.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns; code is generated and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a generated Pulumi resource module for Databricks SQL warehouses, performing standard data retrieval and property access. It contains explicit type checks, uses Pulumi SDK functions, and does not execute external commands or network calls. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or backdoors are present. The data flow is typical for infrastructure as code, with no suspicious sinks or flows. The code's structure and purpose align with safe, SDK-generated resource management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, auto-generated Pulumi module for managing Databricks SQL warehouses, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks detected. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score of 0.1 are consistent with the analysis.",
