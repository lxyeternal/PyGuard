{
  "purpose": "This code defines data structures and functions to retrieve information about SQL warehouses in Databricks using Pulumi.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions such as get_sql_warehouse and get_sql_warehouse_output; environment variables for credentials if used externally.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the functions invoke external services and return data, but no direct data sinks or malicious data exfiltration points are present in this code.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into the get_sql_warehouse and get_sql_warehouse_output functions, which invoke the Databricks API to retrieve warehouse info; data is returned as Pulumi outputs and objects.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code is a typical Pulumi resource and data source definition. The warning comment indicates it is generated code, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Pulumi resource and data source implementation for querying Databricks SQL warehouse details. It performs type checks on constructor arguments, uses Pulumi's invoke mechanism to fetch data, and wraps results in classes. No signs of malicious behavior such as network data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors are present. The code is explicitly marked as generated and primarily handles data retrieval with no external side effects beyond the API call, which is expected for such a resource.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, generated Pulumi data source implementation for Databricks SQL warehouses. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It solely retrieves configuration data and exposes it via Pulumi constructs.",
