  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's logic, potential vulnerabilities, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is boilerplate for Pulumi resource management, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. It handles secrets properly, and no suspicious data flows are evident.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate, no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — correct, code is clear and generated code warnings are standard.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, given the lack of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is standard resource management, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing proper secret handling and no malicious behavior. It notes the use of `pulumi.Output.secret` for sensitive data.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — still low, considering the code is mainly resource boilerplate.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's nature. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on standard resource definitions, proper secret handling, and no malicious code.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct; the code is typical for Pulumi resource classes.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights standard patterns, secret management, and no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is valid; no malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Notes the handling of sensitive tokens within `recipient_profile_str`, which is marked as secret, and no malicious code.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The code manages secrets properly; no issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None. All reports correctly identify that the code is boilerplate resource management code, with standard secret handling.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; the code is clear and generated by Pulumi's tools.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The only minor concern is that `recipient_profile_str` may contain sensitive tokens (like bearer tokens), but the code handles this as a secret output, which is appropriate.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is straightforward, generated boilerplate.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.2** — minor risk due to handling of sensitive tokens, but this is standard practice and not a vulnerability.\n\n### My Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThe code is a standard, well-structured Pulumi resource definition for managing Databricks MetastoreProviders. It handles secrets properly and contains no malicious or obfuscated logic. The slight risk score accounts for the sensitive data involved but does not indicate any security issue.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, standard, and free of malicious content. The assigned scores are appropriate.",
