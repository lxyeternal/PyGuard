{
  "purpose": "This code defines Pulumi resource classes and input types for managing a MetastoreProvider in Databricks, mainly to facilitate infrastructure as code for data sharing configurations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for resource creation such as 'authentication_type', 'recipient_profile_str', 'comment', 'name'; data retrieval through Pulumi's get methods.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data outputs like 'recipient_profile_str' (which may contain JSON with tokens), and 'authentication_type'. The code handles secret data via Pulumi's secret output wrapping.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (source) are passed during resource creation or retrieval; 'recipient_profile_str' can be secret. These flow into resource state and outputs, which may be used elsewhere. No untrusted data flows or execution paths are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic detected. The code includes a warning comment about auto-generation but that is standard. No indications of malicious intent or privacy violations.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines data structures and resource classes for Pulumi. It uses standard patterns for resource creation, property management, and retrieval, with no signs of malicious behavior. The handling of secret outputs is consistent with best practices. No suspicious flows, anomalies, or code injections are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate resource definition code for managing Databricks MetastoreProvider resources via Pulumi. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior. It securely manages sensitive data, with no signs of security risks.",
