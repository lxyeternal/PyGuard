{
  "purpose": "The code defines Pulumi resource classes for managing a Databricks MetastoreProvider, handling input parameters, secrets, and resource properties for infrastructure automation.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'authentication_type', 'recipient_profile_str', 'comment', and 'name'; data flows from user inputs and environment into resource properties.",
  "sinks": "The 'recipient_profile_str' may contain sensitive JSON data (e.g., bearer tokens), wrapped as Pulumi secrets; no external data exfiltration or network activity detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters to resource properties; sensitive data is marked as secrets, preventing leakage; no external sinks or network connections observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious logic detected; code is auto-generated boilerplate with standard secret handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Pulumi resource class for Databricks MetastoreProvider, with proper secret management and no signs of malicious behavior. It handles sensitive data correctly, with no external data flows or obfuscation. The code comments and structure are consistent with generated boilerplate, and no anomalies or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, well-structured, and free of malicious intent or obfuscation. It manages secrets appropriately and contains no suspicious behavior. The overall security risk is minimal.",
