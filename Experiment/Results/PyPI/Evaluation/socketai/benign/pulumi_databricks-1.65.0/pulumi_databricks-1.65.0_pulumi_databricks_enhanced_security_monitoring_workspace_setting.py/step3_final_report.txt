  "purpose": "Auto-generated Pulumi resource class for managing enhanced security monitoring workspace settings in a cloud environment.",
  "sources": "Resource property initializations, getter/setter methods, input argument handling, resource lookup functions.",
  "sinks": "Property accessors, resource creation, and lookup functions; no external network or file operations detected.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into resource properties via setters; data retrieved through getters; no external or untrusted data sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual control flow; standard boilerplate generated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical auto-generated Pulumi resource class with well-structured input types, property accessors, and resource management functions. It does not contain any obfuscated code, network activity, or malicious patterns. The resource handles configuration data securely via Pulumi's input/output abstractions. No external or untrusted data sources are processed in a suspicious manner. The code strictly follows Pulumi SDK conventions, indicating legitimate infrastructure management functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, auto-generated Pulumi resource class for managing security monitoring workspace settings. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code content. Overall, it is safe for use with no security concerns.",
