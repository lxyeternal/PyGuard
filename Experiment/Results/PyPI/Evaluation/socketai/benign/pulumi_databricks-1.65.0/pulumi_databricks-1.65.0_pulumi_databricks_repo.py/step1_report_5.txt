{
  "purpose": "The code defines Pulumi resource types and input arguments for managing Git repositories (Databricks Repos) within a Pulumi infrastructure as code setup.",
  "sources": "User input for repository URL, branch, commit hash, git provider, path, sparse checkout, tag, and workspace path; resource instantiation parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted inputs (e.g., URL, branch, tag) used in resource creation and configuration; no direct data leak points or dangerous operations identified.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (sources) are assigned to resource properties, which are then used to configure Git repositories; no data flows to external systems or network connections within this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a warning comment about being auto-generated; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs; no obfuscated code or unusual logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Pulumi resource and input type definition for managing Git repositories. It performs typical data assignments, property management, and resource instantiation with no signs of malicious behavior. The presence of auto-generated code is normal and does not imply malicious intent. All inputs are used for resource configuration and do not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical Pulumi resource module for managing Databricks Repos with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is a straightforward implementation of infrastructure as code with no suspicious or harmful code elements.",
