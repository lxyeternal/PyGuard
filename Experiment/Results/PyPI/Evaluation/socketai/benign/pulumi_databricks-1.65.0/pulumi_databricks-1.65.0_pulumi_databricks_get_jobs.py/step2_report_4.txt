  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its behavior, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n\n- The code is a set of auto-generated Pulumi SDK wrapper classes and functions for managing Databricks jobs.\n- It primarily performs data retrieval via Pulumi's invoke mechanisms, with input parameters for filtering.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors are evident.\n- The code appears standard for infrastructure as code tooling, with proper type checks and documentation.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Analysis\n\n#### 1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Backdoors**\n\n- **Observation:** No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is standard SDK wrapper code, not malicious.\n\n#### 2. **Potential for Data Leakage or Security Risks**\n\n- **Input parameters (`ids`, `job_name_contains`)** could be controlled by users, but this is typical.\n- **No untrusted data flows into dangerous operations** like command execution or data exfiltration.\n- **No external system commands or network calls** beyond Pulumi's API, which is expected.\n\n#### 3. **Obfuscation or Hidden Malicious Intent**\n\n- **No obfuscated code or unusual patterns**.\n- The code contains a warning about being auto-generated, which is normal.\n- No signs of code hiding or malicious payloads.\n\n#### 4. **Score Justification**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:** Slightly above zero (0.2) in some reports, reflecting the fact that input parameters could influence API calls. This is reasonable but not indicative of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Consistency and Reasonableness\n\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis; no report overstates risk.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or 1), which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment & Recommendations\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and auto-generated, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** — reflects minimal inherent risk due to input parameters but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### My Expert Estimate\n\nConsidering all factors, I would assign:\n\n- **Malware:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated:** **0**  \n- **Risk:** **0.2** (consistent with the reports, as the only concern is potential misuse of input parameters, which is typical for such SDK wrappers)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is legitimate, safe, and typical for infrastructure automation. No evidence suggests malicious intent or security vulnerabilities beyond the inherent risks of exposing API parameters.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always ensure proper access controls and validation on input parameters in the broader system context, but the code itself is safe.",
