  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's behavior, potential security implications, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is an auto-generated Pulumi SDK wrapper for Databricks jobs, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe code performs standard API calls with input validation, no obfuscation, and no malicious patterns. The low malware score is justified. The security risk is low, considering the code's purpose and lack of dangerous operations.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1; standard Pulumi provider code with no malicious intent.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, no signs of malicious behavior. The code is typical for resource data retrieval. The scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard generated Pulumi code for resource management, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nNo suspicious patterns or dangerous operations. The code is straightforward, with no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Typical Pulumi resource code, no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with previous assessments; standard API interaction with no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above; legitimate infrastructure code.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nNo malicious behavior detected. The low security risk is appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's content—no malicious payloads, obfuscation, or backdoors are present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, as the code is clear and generated.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.2) in most reports, justified by the fact that the code interfaces with external systems and accepts parameters that could be misused if misconfigured, but this is standard for resource management code.\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, auto-generated Pulumi SDK wrapper for Databricks, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Adjusted Scores (if any):**  \n- **Malware:** 0 (unchanged)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (unchanged)  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 (consistent with the reports and typical for such SDK code)\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe code performs no malicious operations, no obfuscation, and only interacts with external APIs in a controlled manner. The slight security risk score accounts for potential misuse of input parameters but does not indicate actual vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, legitimate, and aligns with the reports' assessments. No further action is necessary.",
