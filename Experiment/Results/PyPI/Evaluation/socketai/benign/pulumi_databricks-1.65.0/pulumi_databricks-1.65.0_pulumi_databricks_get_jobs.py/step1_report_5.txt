{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes and functions for retrieving Databricks job information via Pulumi, enabling infrastructure as code management and automation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function parameters (e.g., ids, job_name_contains), Pulumi's invoke system, and environment (via sys and pulumi modules).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the use of Pulumi's invoke system which could process untrusted input; however, it is a standard API call, not a malicious sink. No data leakage, command execution, or external network connections are directly evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into invoke functions (get_jobs and get_jobs_output), which retrieve job data and return structured results. No external or untrusted data flows into system commands or network communications.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a warning comment about auto-generated code; no obfuscated code, suspicious dynamic code execution, or hidden backdoors are present. No hardcoded credentials or secret keys are detected. Usage of standard Pulumi API and typing constructs appear normal.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Pulumi-based resource provider wrapper for Databricks, using standard API invocation patterns, typing, and class structures. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code execution. The invocation methods are standard for Pulumi plugins, and no untrusted inputs are processed in insecure ways. The code is well-structured, with clear separation of data classes and API functions. No anomalies, suspicious behaviors, or malicious intents are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, serving as an infrastructure automation interface for Databricks jobs with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It is standard auto-generated code with no suspicious activity.",
