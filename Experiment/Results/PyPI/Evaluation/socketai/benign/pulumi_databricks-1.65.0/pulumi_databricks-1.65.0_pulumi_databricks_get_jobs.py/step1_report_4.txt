{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Pulumi resource and functions to retrieve information about Databricks jobs, including filtering by name or IDs, for managing cloud infrastructure.",
  "sources": "Data is read from function parameters (ids, job_name_contains), and from Pulumi invoke calls retrieving job information.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data are present; output functions process data for return or export, with no apparent data leakage or command execution.",
  "flows": "Parameters (ids, job_name_contains) flow into Pulumi invoke functions; retrieved data flows into return objects or outputs; no untrusted data is used in dangerous operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard resource management code; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The comment warns about generated code, but does not indicate obfuscation or malicious intent. No use of dangerous functions or external command executions is observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Pulumi resource definition for managing Databricks jobs. It uses standard type annotations, invoke calls, and property accessors. No suspicious code, data leaks, or malicious behavior are evident. The warning at the top indicates generated code, not malicious activity. The code's purpose is to facilitate cloud resource management, not to execute untrusted or malicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard resource management script for Databricks jobs, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be legitimate, generated code used for infrastructure automation.",
