{
  "purpose": "Auto-generated Pulumi SDK wrapper for managing Databricks jobs, facilitating data retrieval and resource management.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'ids' and 'job_name_contains' used in API invocation; data retrieved via Pulumi's invoke mechanisms.",
  "sinks": "API calls to external Databricks services; no untrusted data flows into system commands or sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Parameters flow into Pulumi API invocation functions, which fetch job data; no dangerous or malicious data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns; standard auto-generated SDK code with warning comments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical auto-generated Pulumi SDK wrapper for Databricks resources, performing data retrieval via API calls with input validation. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors are present. The input parameters could be controlled by users, but this is standard for resource management SDKs. The code does not execute system commands, perform network operations beyond API calls, or contain malicious payloads. The malware score is appropriately 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is around 0.2, reflecting minimal potential misuse but no active vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, safe, and typical for infrastructure as code SDKs. It does not contain malware or malicious intent. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
