  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard utility for syncing git tags between upstream and forked repositories. It contains no malicious code, obfuscation, or security flaws. The security risk is minimal and inherent to its function. The existing scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low risk score (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
