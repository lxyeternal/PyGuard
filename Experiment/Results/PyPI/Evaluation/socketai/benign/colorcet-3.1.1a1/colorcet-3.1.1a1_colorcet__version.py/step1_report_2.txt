{
  "purpose": "Define version information for the package using setuptools-scm conventions.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and version tuple variables.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the code only assigns static version info without external data input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets version variables for a Python package, including __version__, version, __version_tuple__, and version_tuple. It uses conditional type checking, but no dynamic code execution or untrusted data input is present. The version string is hardcoded as '3.1.1a1', which is standard practice for versioning. The code is straightforward and adheres to common version definition patterns without any malicious or suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, static version declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves a benign purpose of version tracking in a package.",
