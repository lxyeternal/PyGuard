  "purpose": "Define version information for the package using setuptools-scm conventions.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuples, static definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points; purely static code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; static definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of version strings, but nothing unusual or suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes version variables and tuples, including static version information. It contains standard boilerplate for version management, including type hints and conditional assignment. No input/output handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution is present. No signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version metadata definition with no malicious behavior or security issues detected. It serves as static configuration data for package versioning.",
