{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, using variables and type annotations, generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded string and tuple literals to set version variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data output.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flows from external sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and only contains static version definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes version-related variables with static values, with conditional type annotations that do not execute at runtime. The version string '3.1.1a1' appears to be an alpha release indicator but is a normal practice in versioning, not malicious. No input/output, network activity, or obfuscated code present. The code’s purpose is solely to provide version metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard version declaration boilerplate with no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. It is safe and typical for package versioning.",
