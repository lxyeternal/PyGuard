{
  "purpose": "Provides static version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version string '3.1.1a1' and version tuple (3, 1, 1); conditional type hint imports.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Assignment of static version data to variables; no dynamic or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, auto-generated, with standard type hinting.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, auto-generated module for version info, with no dynamic behavior, external data, or malicious patterns. It uses conditional type hints for static analysis, which are harmless. The version string indicates an alpha release but is not suspicious. All signals point to benign, straightforward code with no obfuscation or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static version declaration module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security concerns. All scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero, and confidence is high.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
