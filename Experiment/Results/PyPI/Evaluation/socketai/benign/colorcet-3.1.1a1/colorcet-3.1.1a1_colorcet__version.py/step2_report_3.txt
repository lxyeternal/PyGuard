  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is static, auto-generated, and solely for version information.\n- No untrusted data sources, dynamic code, network activity, or obfuscation are present.\n- The version string '3.1.1a1' is a typical alpha release indicator, not malicious.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The security risk score is consistently 0, which seems appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**Confirming code issues:**\n- The code is straightforward, with no evidence of code injection, obfuscation, or malicious logic.\n- The conditional type hinting is standard practice and does not introduce security concerns.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n**Scores and their reasonableness:**\n- Malware score: 0 across all reports is justified.\n- Obfuscated score: 0 is correct, as the code is clear and generated.\n- Risk score: 0 is appropriate; no security issues are evident.\n\n**Potential issues or assumptions:**\n- The reports assume static, benign code, which is accurate.\n- No claims of vulnerabilities based on assumptions are present.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is a typical version declaration module with no security risks.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- Malware score: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- Obfuscated score: 0 (no obfuscation)\n- Risk score: 0 (no security concern)\n\n**Final note:**\n- No changes needed to the scores.\n- The code is safe, benign, and standard for package versioning.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are correct. The code is a benign, static version info module with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
