  "purpose": "Define version information for a Python package generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuples, static code initialization.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or data sinks; only static assignments and type hints.",
  "flows": "Initialization of version variables from static strings and tuples.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward version info setup with no dynamic or external data processing.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard versioning setup for a Python package. It assigns static version strings and tuples, includes conditional type hinting imports, and avoids dynamic or network-related operations. There are no suspicious behaviors, hidden code, or data leaks. The variables are statically assigned and do not interact with external inputs or perform any malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, typical versioning module generated by setuptools-scm with no malicious intent or security risks.",
