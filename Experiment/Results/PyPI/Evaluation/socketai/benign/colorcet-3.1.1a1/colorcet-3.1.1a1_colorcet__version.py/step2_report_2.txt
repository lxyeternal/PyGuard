  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a static, auto-generated version declaration.\n- No dynamic code, external data sources, or network activity are involved.\n- The version string '3.1.1a1' indicates an alpha release, which is standard practice.\n- The code uses conditional type hints, but these are for static analysis and do not affect runtime behavior.\n- No obfuscation, malicious patterns, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Logical Checks:\n- The code assigns static version strings and tuples; no evidence of dynamic or malicious code.\n- The type hinting conditional is standard for type checking and does not introduce risk.\n- The version string is hardcoded and typical for pre-release versions.\n- No data flows, external inputs, or outputs are involved.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are evident.\n- The code's purpose is clear and straightforward.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n### Scores and Reasoning:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as code is straightforward and auto-generated.\n- **Security risk score:** 0, no external data or dynamic behavior.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- The reports assign a risk score of 0.5 or higher only in some cases, but given the analysis, these should remain at 0.\n- The version string '3.1.1a1' is a pre-release indicator but is not malicious or risky; it's standard versioning.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a typical, benign version declaration module with no security risks. The reports are accurate, but perhaps overly cautious in some cases.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThis code is a standard, auto-generated version info module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores should all remain at 0, reflecting its benign nature.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
