  "purpose": "Define and assign version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements for version strings and tuples.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; all data is hardcoded.",
  "flows": "Assignment of hardcoded version strings and tuples to variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard version assignment, and includes comments indicating auto-generation.",
  "analysis": "The code sets version metadata for a Python package, using hardcoded version strings and tuples. It includes a type checking conditional to define type hints but defaults to objects at runtime. The comments explicitly state the file is generated and should not be altered. No user input, network data, or external sources are involved. There are no suspicious behaviors, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated version information module with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply defines version variables for the package. The overall security risk is minimal.",
