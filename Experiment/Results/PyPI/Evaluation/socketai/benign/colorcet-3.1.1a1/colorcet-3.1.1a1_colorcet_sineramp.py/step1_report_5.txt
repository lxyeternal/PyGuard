{
  "purpose": "Generate a sine wave superimposed on a ramp color map test image for evaluating perceptual contrast of color maps.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: size, amp, wavelen, p; internally, the range of size and parameters; data generated by numpy operations.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any explicit sinks such as network connections, file I/O, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Input parameters influence the calculation of the sine wave, modulation, and normalization steps; the generated image data is returned as a numpy array.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, no hardcoded credentials, no data exfiltration, no obfuscated code, and no hidden functionalities observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily generates a test pattern using mathematical sine functions, meshgrid, and normalization routines with numpy. It does not perform any network, file, or system modifications. All operations are mathematical and related to image data creation. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data theft, remote control, or sabotage. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a visual test pattern generator, consistent with its described purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign image generation function with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It solely creates a mathematical pattern for testing color maps and has no network, file, or system access capabilities. Overall, it is safe for use.",
