{
  "purpose": "Generates a sine wave superimposed on a ramp pattern for evaluating color maps, useful for visual assessment of perceptual contrast and feature discernibility.",
  "sources": "Uses numpy functions such as np.sin, np.meshgrid, np.arange, and array manipulations to compute the pattern data.",
  "sinks": "No external data or network activity; purely computational with no data leaks or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "Calculates sine wave across columns, modulates amplitude with a power function across rows, combines these to form the image, and normalizes each row to span 0-255.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected; straightforward mathematical implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard numpy operations to generate a visual test pattern. It adjusts the number of sine wave cycles to fit the image width, applies a vertical attenuation, and normalizes each row. There are no external data dependencies, network calls, or system modifications. The purpose is solely for visual evaluation of color maps, with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-documented utility for creating test images for color map assessment. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The previously assigned low security risk scores (e.g., 0.1) are overly cautious; the appropriate score is 0.",
