  "purpose": "Generate a sine wave superimposed on a ramp color map test image for evaluating color map effectiveness.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: size, amp, wavelen, p; meshgrid ranges; sine calculation; normalization process.",
  "sinks": "Normalization step where image data is scaled; potential to influence how data is represented but no malicious data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> sine wave and ramp calculations -> meshgrid creation -> normalization of rows -> output image array.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The code performs standard mathematical and array operations without obfuscation or misleading variable names. No external data sources or network connections are present.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by defining parameters with defaults and checks the size input for correctness. It calculates the number of sine wave cycles based on image width, ensuring an integer number of cycles. It generates a sine wave pattern and a vertical modulation function, combines them, and adds a ramp to create the test image. Each row is then normalized to span the full data range (0-255). There are no network calls, file operations, or external data inputs. The code performs standard mathematical operations for image synthesis, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious payloads. It adheres to typical data processing patterns for image generation, with no suspicious anomalies or obfuscated code features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility to generate a specific test image pattern for evaluating color maps. It contains no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The operations are purely mathematical and array-based, with no external or secret data handling.",
