  "purpose": "Generate a sine wave superimposed on a ramp function for evaluating the effectiveness of different colour maps in visual perception tests.",
  "sources": "Reads parameters for size, amplitude, wavelength, and attenuation power; creates sine wave and ramp data; normalizes the data for display.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network transmission, file writing, or sensitive data access are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters influence sine wave and ramp generation; normalized image data is returned for visualization, with no data leaving the system.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated segments. The code is straightforward in generating a test image.",
  "analysis": "The function defines default parameters for image size, sine wave amplitude, wavelength, and attenuation. It adjusts the number of columns to ensure an integer number of sine wave cycles, then creates a sine wave pattern. The vertical modulation is applied to attenuate the sine wave amplitude from top to bottom, based on a power function. A ramp function is added horizontally to shift the data across the full data range. Each row of the resulting matrix is normalized to span from 0 to 255 to ensure consistent display. The process involves standard numpy operations, meshgrid, and normalization, with no external data input or network activity. There are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for generating test images to evaluate colour maps. It performs mathematical operations to create a visual pattern without any malicious intent or suspicious behaviors.",
