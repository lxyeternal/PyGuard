  "purpose": "Generate a sine wave superimposed on a ramp for evaluating color maps.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: size, amp, wavelen, p; internal calculations with numpy functions; meshgrid creation; range functions.",
  "sinks": "No evident data sinks that send data externally, no network or file I/O operations, no credential or secret handling.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> Calculation of sine wave and ramp -> Normalization process -> Output image array.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code. The code performs mathematical operations and normalizes data in a straightforward manner.",
  "analysis": "The function takes size and parameters to generate a 2D numpy array representing a sine wave on a ramp. It adjusts the width for an integer number of sine cycles, computes the sine wave, applies a vertical attenuation factor, adds a ramp overlay, and normalizes each row to the full data range. The code uses standard numpy functions for mathematical operations, meshgrid for grid creation, and simple array manipulations. There are no external data transmissions, no file or network I/O, no dynamic code execution, nor any suspicious behavior such as hidden backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for generating test images of sine waves on ramps for color map evaluation. It contains no malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The implementation is straightforward and adheres to typical data processing patterns, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
