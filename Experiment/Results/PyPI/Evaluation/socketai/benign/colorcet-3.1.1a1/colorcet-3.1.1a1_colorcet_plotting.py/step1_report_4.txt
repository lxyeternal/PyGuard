{
  "purpose": "This module provides functions to facilitate plotting of colormaps and sine ramps using Holoviews with support for multiple backends (Bokeh and Matplotlib). It primarily serves visualization purposes within larger projects.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include user-supplied 'name', 'cmap', 'bounds', and 'args' parameters, as well as internally generated arrays and meshgrids. Data is also read from imported modules such as 'get_aliases', 'palette', 'cm', and 'sineramp'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain sinks that lead to data leakage or malicious actions. It generates visualizations and does not perform network communication, file access, or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user parameters or internal generated data into plotting functions, which configure visualization objects (hv.Image, hv.Points, hv.Layout). There are no untrusted data flows into sensitive operations; all data used for visualization appears safe and controlled.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic code execution are present. The code follows standard visualization patterns and uses well-known libraries. The 'data' array is generated internally with no external data dependencies beyond visualization inputs.",
  "analysis": "The code provides functions for visualizing colormaps and sine ramps, using external libraries (numpy, holoviews). It handles user inputs for selecting colormaps or groups, and dynamically adjusts visualization parameters based on available backends. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification. The only data manipulation involves array creation and shuffling for visualization purposes. Overall, the code performs safe visualization routines without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code module is intended for visualization purposes and does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior. It safely generates visual representations using user and internal data. There are no signs of malware or security risks.",
