{
  "purpose": "This module provides functions for visualizing colormaps and related data using Holoviews, supporting both Bokeh and Matplotlib backends.",
  "sources": "Imports numpy, holoviews, and local modules; reads from 'palette', 'get_aliases', 'all_original_names', and 'cm'; accesses hv.Store.loaded_backends().",
  "sinks": "Uses hv.Points with data 'data' for visualization; no untrusted data sinks, network connections, or sensitive data outputs detected.",
  "flows": "Source data (e.g., 'array', 'data') flows into visualization functions like hv.Image and hv.Points; no external untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Functions are for visualization; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines visualization functions for colormaps and sample data, utilizing Holoviews with support for Bokeh and Matplotlib. It reads local data, functions, and configuration parameters. No input/output vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are evident. The 'candy_buttons' function uses a static dataset for plotting, with no network activity or data exfiltration. Use of 'hv.Store.loaded_backends()' is for backend detection and not suspicious. No obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic execution, and no hidden backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is solely for visualization purposes, with no malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks detected. It operates on static data and standard visualization libraries without any suspicious behavior.",
