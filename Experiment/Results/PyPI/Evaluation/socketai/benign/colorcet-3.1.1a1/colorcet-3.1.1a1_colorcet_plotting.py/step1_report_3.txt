{
  "purpose": "This module provides visualization functions for colormaps and data points, mainly for documentation purposes and plotting colormap swatches, sine ramps, and interactive color points.",
  "sources": "Imports from external libraries (numpy, holoviews), internal module functions (get_aliases, all_original_names, palette, cm, sineramp), and internal data arrays (array, sine, data).",
  "sinks": "hv.Image and hv.Points objects used to generate visualizations; no explicit data leaks or external communications; no user input processing observed.",
  "flows": "Input data arrays are used to generate visualization objects via holoviews; colormap names and configurations are passed to plotting options; no untrusted data flow to external systems or files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code; plotting functions use static datasets and configurations; no dynamic code execution or network operations observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines visualization functions for colormap swatches, sine ramps, and data points using holoviews. It dynamically adapts to available backends (matplotlib, bokeh) and provides options for customization. The arrays used for visualization are generated within the code and are not sourced from external inputs. No external data or user inputs are processed, and there are no signs of malicious activities such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoor access. The code is straightforward and intended solely for visualization purposes, with no evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be purely for visualization and documentation, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It uses static data and well-defined plotting libraries without any suspicious operations. Overall, it poses no security threat.",
