  "purpose": "Visualization functions for colormaps and sine ramps, mainly used for documentation and plotting purposes.",
  "sources": "Internal data arrays, static data generated within the module, and user-supplied parameters for visualization.",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission, network activity, or file I/O; outputs are local visualizations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from internal arrays or parameters into visualization functions, with no external untrusted data sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors; uses standard libraries and static data.",
  "analysis": "The code provides visualization utilities for colormaps and sine ramps, relying solely on internal data and standard visualization libraries. There are no external data sources, network activities, or dynamic code execution. The functions are straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The use of hv.Store.loaded_backends() is standard for backend detection and does not indicate malicious intent. The data is static or generated internally, and no secrets or sensitive information are handled.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign visualization utility with no malicious, obfuscated, or high-security-risk behaviors. The assigned scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
