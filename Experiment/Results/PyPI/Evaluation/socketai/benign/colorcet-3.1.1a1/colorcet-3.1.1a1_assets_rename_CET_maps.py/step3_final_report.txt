  "purpose": "Batch renaming and moving of CET CSV files to descriptive names using a mapping, then removing the original directory.",
  "sources": "Filesystem filenames in 'CETperceptual_csv_0_1_v2' directory, and the 'mapping' dictionary from CET_to_py.py",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls executing 'git mv' commands with filenames embedded in shell commands",
  "flows": "Filesystem filenames → mapping lookup → filename modification → subprocess.run with shell=True → 'git mv' commands → directory removal",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess.run with shell=True without sanitization of filenames; no validation of filenames before passing to shell commands",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward file renaming using git commands via subprocess. Filenames are sourced from the filesystem and a static mapping, with no user input. The primary security concern is the use of shell=True, which could be exploited if filenames are manipulated maliciously. However, given the controlled environment and filenames from trusted sources, the risk is minimal. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent is evident. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.1-0.4) are consistent with this assessment. Improving security by avoiding shell=True or sanitizing filenames would be advisable, but overall, the code is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign batch file renaming utility with minimal security concerns. The main issue is the use of subprocess with shell=True without sanitization, which could be exploited if filenames are manipulated maliciously. No malware or obfuscation is present. The current scores are appropriate, though slightly increasing the securityRisk score could reflect best practices.",
