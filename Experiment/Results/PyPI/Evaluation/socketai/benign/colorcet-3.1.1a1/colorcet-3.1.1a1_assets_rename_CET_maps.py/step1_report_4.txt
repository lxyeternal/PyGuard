  "purpose": "Convert specific CSV files to descriptive names using a mapping and move them to a single directory, then remove the original directory.",
  "sources": "Reading CSV filenames from the directory 'CETperceptual_csv_0_1_v2', importing the 'mapping' dictionary from 'CET_to_py'.",
  "sinks": "Executing shell commands via subprocess.run to rename files with 'git mv' and remove the directory with 'git rm -rf'.",
  "flows": "Directory listing -> filename lookup in 'mapping' -> filename modification -> 'git mv' command -> directory removal.",
  "anomalies": "Use of shell=True in subprocess.run; no validation or sanitization of filenames before passing to shell commands; reliance on external 'mapping' for filename translation. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs file renaming and directory cleanup using Git commands. It reads filenames from a specific directory, maps them to descriptive names, and moves them with 'git mv'. The use of subprocess.run with shell=True could pose risks if filename inputs are malicious, but filenames are sourced locally from the filesystem and not externally influenced in this script. There are no indications of code injection, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The code's intent is straightforward, and no malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate file management operations related to renaming and cleaning up CSV files using Git commands. There is no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or malware. The use of subprocess with shell=True is potentially risky if filenames are manipulated externally, but within this context, it appears to be used safely. Overall, the script is benign with minimal security concerns.",
