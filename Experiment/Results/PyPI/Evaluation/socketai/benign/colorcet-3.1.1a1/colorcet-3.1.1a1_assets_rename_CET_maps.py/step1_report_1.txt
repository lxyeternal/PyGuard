  "purpose": "Convert CET-*.csv files to descriptive names using a mapping and move them to a single folder with version control commands.",
  "sources": "The code reads CSV files from the directory 'CETperceptual_csv_0_1_v2' and the 'mapping' dictionary imported from CET_to_py.",
  "sinks": "Uses subprocess.run to execute 'git mv' commands to rename and move files, and 'git rm' to remove a directory.",
  "flows": "Reads filenames from the directory -> Looks up new names in 'mapping' -> Constructs new paths -> Executes 'git mv' for each file -> Removes the original directory with 'git rm'.",
  "anomalies": "Uses subprocess with shell=True for executing git commands, which could be risky if input were untrusted; however, input is filenames from the filesystem and a static mapping. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script systematically processes CSV filenames, mapping them to new names, and moves them within a git-controlled environment. The use of subprocess with shell=True could be risky if filenames were manipulated maliciously, but since filenames are sourced from the filesystem and controlled mapping, this risk is minimal. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration present. The script performs standard file manipulation commands under version control.\n\nNo evidence of malware or malicious behavior such as data theft, network activity, or backdoors. The operations are limited to file renaming and directory removal, consistent with normal project maintenance.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a controlled batch rename and move of files within a version control context, with no signs of malicious intent or malware. Usage of subprocess with shell=True is a potential minor concern but not malicious given the context. Overall, the code appears benign and related to project maintenance tasks.",
