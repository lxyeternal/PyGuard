  "purpose": "Convert CET-*.csv files to descriptive names using a mapping and move them into a single folder, then remove the original folder.",
  "sources": "Reading CSV filenames from the directory, accessing the 'mapping' dictionary imported from CET_to_py, reading and modifying filename strings.",
  "sinks": "Executing 'git mv' commands to move and rename files, executing 'git rm' to remove directories, subprocess.run calls executing shell commands.",
  "flows": "Filename paths are read from the filesystem, then mapped via 'mapping', filenames are modified, then 'git mv' commands move the files based on these names. Final 'git rm' deletes the directory.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'subprocess.run' with 'shell=True' can be risky if filenames are manipulated, but filenames are derived from directory listings and controlled mapping. No hardcoded secrets or credentials. No obfuscated code. The code relies on the 'mapping' dict which could be manipulated if compromised, but is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The script enumerates CSV files in a specific directory, uses a mapping to rename them, modifies filenames based on conditions, and moves files with 'git mv' through subprocess. It then deletes the source directory. The use of subprocess with shell=True could be risky in a different context, but here filenames are controlled. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration present. The code performs filesystem operations and version control commands to organize files, which is typical for such a script.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, designed solely to rename and move CSV files in a controlled manner, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. No malware indicators are present.",
