  "purpose": "Convert specific CSV files in a directory to new descriptive names based on a mapping, and move/rename them within a git repository.",
  "sources": "Reading CSV files from the directory CETperceptual_csv_0_1_v2, importing the mapping dictionary from CET_to_py.py",
  "sinks": "Running 'git mv' commands to rename/move files, executing shell commands via subprocess.run",
  "flows": "Listing CSV files -> Mapping filenames -> Renaming files via 'git mv' -> Removing original directory with 'git rm -rf'",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess with shell=True (potential command injection if variables are manipulated), no validation of mapping keys, no sanitization of filenames, direct execution of shell commands, no error handling for subprocess failures",
  "analysis": "The script reads CSV filenames from a directory, matches them to a mapping dictionary imported from an external module, constructs new filenames, and renames/moves files using 'git mv' via subprocess with shell=True. It also removes the original directory with 'git rm -rf'. The use of subprocess with shell=True introduces a potential command injection risk if filenames are manipulated or maliciously crafted. No validation or sanitization of filenames or paths is present, which could lead to unintended command execution. The code appears to perform intended file operations with no overt malicious intent, but the method of executing shell commands is insecure and could be exploited. The code does not contain obfuscated code or hidden backdoors. No suspicious network activity or data exfiltration is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a file renaming and moving script with some insecure subprocess calls. There is no clear evidence of malicious behavior or malware, but the insecure handling of shell commands poses a security risk that could be exploited in a malicious environment. Overall, the script appears to be intended for legitimate batch file renaming but should avoid 'shell=True' or sanitize inputs.",
