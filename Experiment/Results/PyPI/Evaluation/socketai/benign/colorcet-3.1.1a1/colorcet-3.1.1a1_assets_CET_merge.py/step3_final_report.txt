{
  "purpose": "Merge new alias and cetname dictionaries with existing ones, report conflicts, and output formatted dictionaries.",
  "sources": "Imports new_aliases and new_cetnames from CET_updates; reads existing aliases and cetnames dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "None; data is merged and printed; no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Data flows from imported new_aliases/new_cetnames into merge functions, then to print functions.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward dictionary merging, conflict detection, and formatted printing. It imports data from a trusted module, processes it with simple dictionary operations, and outputs results. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is present. The conflict detection logic compares dictionaries and reports differences without executing or modifying external systems.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for managing color mapping dictionaries, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. It poses minimal security risk, primarily related to data handling, which is low and acceptable for such a utility.",
