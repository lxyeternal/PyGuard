{
  "purpose": "The script merges new alias and cetname mappings with existing ones, reporting conflicts and printing the merged dictionaries.",
  "sources": "Imports CET_updates for new data; reads no external input during execution; uses hardcoded dictionaries for current data.",
  "sinks": "Print statements output the merged dictionaries and conflict reports; no external data sinks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Merge functions take new data and existing data, combine them while checking for conflicts, then output the results via print.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. No use of eval or exec; no obfuscated code. No suspicious string operations or system calls.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs data merging and conflict reporting for dictionary data structures. It imports new data from CET_updates, processes merging with conflict detection, and prints formatted dictionaries. The functions operate on data structures without performing network operations, file manipulations, or external system modifications. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are apparent. The code’s logic is straightforward and does not include any obfuscated or hidden behavior. The initial appending to sys.path is standard for modular code inclusion. The print functions merely output data in a formatted manner. Overall, the script appears to be a benign utility for dictionary management within a larger context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a utility script for merging and reporting conflicts in alias and cetname dictionaries. It performs no malicious actions, contains no backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious network activity. It is safe from a supply chain security perspective based on this analysis.",
