{
  "purpose": "The script merges alias and cetname dictionaries from new updates into existing ones, with conflict detection and formatted output.",
  "sources": "Imports new_cetnames and new_aliases from CET_updates; reads existing alias and cetname dicts defined as empty at start.",
  "sinks": "Print statements for outputting dictionaries and conflict notices.",
  "flows": "Merge functions update_aliases and update_cetnames combine new and old data; print_dict outputs formatted dictionaries; conflicts detected and printed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious code patterns; standard dictionary merge logic; no obfuscated code; no network or system modification activities.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing necessary modules and appending a parent directory to sys.path to access CET_updates. It imports new alias and cetname data, then initializes empty dicts for existing data. Functions are defined for conflict detection, merging, and formatted printing. The main block updates the dictionaries with new data, detects conflicts, and prints the merged dictionaries along with conflict notices. The logic is straightforward, focusing on data merging and reporting, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The code does not perform any network communication, system modification, or data exfiltration; it strictly manages data structures and outputs results.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions as a safe, straightforward merge utility for dictionary data. It includes conflict detection and formatted output but shows no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The code appears intended for data management within a controlled environment without external harm or privacy violations.",
