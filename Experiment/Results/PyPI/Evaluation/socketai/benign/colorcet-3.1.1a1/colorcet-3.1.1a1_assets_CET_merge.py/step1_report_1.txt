{
  "purpose": "The script merges new alias and cetname dictionaries into existing ones for color mapping purposes, while reporting conflicts.",
  "sources": "Imports new_aliases and new_cetnames from CET_updates; reads existing alias and cetname dictionaries; command-line execution triggers merge functions.",
  "sinks": "Outputs printed to console, including merged dictionaries and conflict notices; no external data sinks or network connections observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from imported dictionaries through merge functions, resulting in printed representations and conflict reports; no untrusted data flows to critical sinks like system calls or network.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors detected; the code primarily performs dictionary merging, printing, and conflict detection without obfuscation or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The script imports updates, initializes empty alias and cetname dictionaries, defines functions to find conflicts and merge dictionaries, and prints results with formatted output. The main execution merges new data into existing dictionaries, reports conflicts, and outputs the merged dictionaries. No code injection, dynamic execution, or suspicious behavior is present. It performs straightforward dictionary operations and formatted printing aligned with its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility script designed for managing and merging color mapping dictionaries with conflict detection. There are no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior within this code.",
