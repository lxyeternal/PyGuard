{
  "purpose": "This script merges new alias and cetname data into existing dictionaries, checks for conflicts, and prints the merged results, primarily for updating color mapping configurations.",
  "sources": "Data is read from imported variables new_aliases and new_cetnames, and from the existing aliases and cetnames dictionaries, which are intended to be manually copied in from another source.",
  "sinks": "The script outputs merged dictionaries and conflict notices to the console, but does not write to files or network. No untrusted data is executed or sent elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external source variables (new_aliases, new_cetnames) into internal merge functions; conflicts are detected by comparing incoming and existing data; final merged data is printed to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic execution are present. The code relies on manual data input and straightforward dictionary manipulations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports data from CET_updates and merges it into existing alias and cetname dictionaries, resolving conflicts and printing the results. Merge functions ensure old data takes precedence. The code employs regular expressions for sorting cetnames, and uses standard data structures and simple I/O. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or malicious side effects; the code appears to be a utility for data management with no network or system alterations.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility designed for merging and reporting updates to color mapping datasets. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. Its purpose is configuration management, and it operates solely via console output.",
