{
  "purpose": "The script merges new alias and cetname dictionaries into existing ones, checking for conflicts, and outputs formatted dictionaries with conflict notices.",
  "sources": "Imports from CET_updates.py (new_aliases, new_cetnames), external input in the form of the imported dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks such as network, file I/O, or system commands are present; output is only to standard output (print statements).",
  "flows": "Data flows from imported new_aliases and new_cetnames into the update functions, then into print functions for display.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behavior; the code uses standard Python functions, regular expressions, and data structures. No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated parts.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs dictionary merging and conflict detection, with no evidence of malicious activities. It imports new data, updates existing dictionaries, and outputs formatted representations. The code does not perform network operations, file modifications, or execute system commands. The only external input is the imported data, and the output is simply printed text. There are no suspicious functions, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns observed. The overall behavior appears safe and typical for a configuration/merge script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data merging and formatting utility with no signs of malicious intent or malicious code. It solely manages internal data structures and outputs formatted data. There is a very low likelihood of malicious behavior.",
