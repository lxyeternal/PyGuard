  "purpose": "Configuration script for setting up documentation build settings for the 'colorcet' project using Sphinx.",
  "sources": "Imports from nbsite.shared_conf, colorcet.__version__, and static/static paths in the HTML configuration.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data leading to security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "flows": "Imports data from external modules (nbsite.shared_conf, colorcet.__version__) and assigns values to configuration variables.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily sets documentation build options, including project info, theme settings, static paths, and analytics. It imports configurations and version info from external modules. All imported modules are standard for documentation setup; no suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The configuration variables are static and serve the purpose of customizing the documentation site. The code does not perform any network operations, file manipulations, or data leaks. No anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard configuration script for documentation with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It relies on external modules that are presumed safe. The overall security risk is negligible.",
