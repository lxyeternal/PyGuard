  "purpose": "The code generates visualizations of color palettes from the 'colorcet' library, arranging them into a layout and saving as an image.",
  "sources": "Reads color palette names and categories from 'colorcet' functions ('all_original_names', 'aliases')",
  "sinks": "Saves the generated visualization image to './images/named.png'",
  "flows": "Retrieves palette data -> creates visual components (sine_combs, swatches) -> arranges components in layout -> saves image file",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports trusted visualization libraries, retrieves palette data, constructs visual components, arranges them into a layout, and saves the output image. No network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation is present. The data flow is straightforward, and the code performs standard visualization tasks. No anomalies or malicious patterns are identified. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign visualization script with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are accurate and justified based on the code's behavior. No adjustments are necessary.",
