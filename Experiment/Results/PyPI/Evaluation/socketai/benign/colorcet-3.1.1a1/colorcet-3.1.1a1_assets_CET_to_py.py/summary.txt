  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign utility for generating colormap modules from trusted CSV sources. No malware, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The primary security consideration is ensuring the CSV files are from trusted sources to prevent injection of malicious data into the generated code. The current scoring of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.2 is appropriate and justified."
