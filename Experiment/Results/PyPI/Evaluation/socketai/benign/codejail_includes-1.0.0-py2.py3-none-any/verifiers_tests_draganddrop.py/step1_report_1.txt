{
  "purpose": "The code provides unit tests for a drag-and-drop functionality, including comparison and grading methods, as well as data population and position comparison classes.",
  "sources": "Code reads JSON strings (simulating user input), and data structures for correct answers and configurations.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are evident; the code only performs data comparison and validation without executing untrusted code or network operations.",
  "flows": "JSON input is parsed and processed through grading functions; data structures are compared via class methods without executing code or data injection points.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code mainly consists of test cases and data structures; no suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is structured as a set of unit tests targeting a drag-and-drop validation library. It uses JSON serialization/deserialization for input data and compares user responses with correct answers. There are no indications of malicious code such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. The functions only perform data validation and comparison logic, with no obfuscated code or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test suite for validating a drag-and-drop functionality. It contains no malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code strictly performs data comparisons and test assertions, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
