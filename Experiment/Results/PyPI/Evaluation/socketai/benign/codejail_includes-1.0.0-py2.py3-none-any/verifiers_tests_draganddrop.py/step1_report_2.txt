{
  "purpose": "The code provides unit tests for a drag-and-drop interaction module, including comparison and grading functionalities.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local module '.draganddrop', input data for grading functions via JSON strings, and method calls on draganddrop objects.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involved; the code does not send data over networks, write to files, or execute system commands.",
  "flows": "Input JSON strings are parsed and used to create draganddrop.DragAndDrop objects, then methods compare positions or grade user responses based on predefined correct answers.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors. The code appears solely focused on testing logic with no suspicious side-effects.",
  "analysis": "The script consists exclusively of test cases designed to verify the functionality of a drag-and-drop module. It uses standard libraries like json and unittest without dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leakage. All data manipulations involve parsing JSON and invoking methods on imported classes. No suspicious code structures, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads are present. The code is clearly for testing purposes and does not perform any operations outside normal testing scope.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a comprehensive set of unit tests for a drag-and-drop utility module, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It is benign and solely aimed at verifying functionality.",
