{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for a drag-and-drop interaction module, including comparison and grading functions for user inputs against correct answers.",
  "sources": "Input data read from json strings in test cases (e.g., user_input, correct_answer). Also, data read from JSON files when instantiated with JSON strings in draganddrop.DragAndDrop.",
  "sinks": "The code processes input data for testing purposes but does not write to or send data over networks. No explicit data leakage or harmful sink detected.",
  "flows": "Input data (json strings) are parsed into Python objects; these are then used within class methods to compare and grade user responses. No data is sent or written externally.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. No obfuscated code, malicious system modifications, or suspicious external interactions. Code is straightforward and test-focused.",
  "analysis": "The script is a comprehensive suite of unit tests targeting a drag-and-drop module. It tests various scenarios, including matching positions, reusing draggables, and handling multiple correct answers. No code performs network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration. No malicious or sabotage code detected. The module relies on the imported 'draganddrop' package, which appears to be used solely for grading logic, without malicious behavior. Overall, the code is well-structured, standard for testing, with no suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit testing suite for a drag-and-drop grading system. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious network or system activity, and no obfuscated code. It appears purely to validate functionality of the draganddrop module. Security risk is minimal, with no signs of malware or sabotage.",
