The scoring scheme is consistent with the described behaviors. Unless concrete code evidence contradicts these descriptions, the scores are justified and accurate."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for grading drag-and-drop responses. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The minimal security concern relates to parsing untrusted JSON inputs, which is common and manageable. Therefore, the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is very low (0.1) to reflect the minimal potential for issues with untrusted input size."

      "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign; no malicious activity is evident. The main concern is the use of 'import *', which can hide malicious code if the imported module is compromised. Scores are consistent with the minimal code and potential risks. Further review of 'loncapa_check' is advised to ensure its integrity."

      "conclusion": "The code is safe, benign utility code with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score (around 0.1) is appropriate given the silent error handling. The malware score is correctly 0, and the obfuscated score is 0. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent."
