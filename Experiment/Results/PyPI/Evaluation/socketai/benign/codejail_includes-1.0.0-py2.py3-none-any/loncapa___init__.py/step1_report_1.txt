  "purpose": "Import all components from the 'loncapa_check' module for use in the current script.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .loncapa_check import *",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the imported module could contain sinks if it executes untrusted code or performs malicious actions upon import.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow is visible in this snippet; reliance on external module behavior is implied.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' which can obscure imported content and behavior; no other anomalies are evident in this minimal code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a shebang line, a comment about linting, and a single import statement using a wildcard import from a relative module. The import style can hide malicious code if the module itself is malicious, but the code snippet alone does not contain malicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials, network connections, or suspicious logic are present in this fragment. The main concern is the use of wildcard import which can import unintended or malicious code if the module is compromised, but this cannot be confirmed from this snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself appears to be a simple module import with no direct malicious actions. The security concern lies in the content of the 'loncapa_check' module, which is not provided here. Overall, there is no evident malicious behavior, but the import method warrants caution.",
