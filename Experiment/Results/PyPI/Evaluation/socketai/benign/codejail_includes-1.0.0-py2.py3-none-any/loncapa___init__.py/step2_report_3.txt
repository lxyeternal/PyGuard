  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports focus on the same code snippet: a shebang, a comment, and a wildcard import from a local module (`from .loncapa_check import *`).\n- The primary concern raised across reports is the use of `import *`, which can obscure imported symbols and potentially hide malicious code if the module is compromised.\n- No actual malicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, network activity, or suspicious logic is present in the snippet itself.\n- The security risks depend heavily on the content and integrity of the `loncapa_check` module, which is not provided.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present in the code:\n- The code itself is minimal and does not contain malicious actions.\n- The wildcard import (`import *`) can be risky in general because it obscures what is imported, but this is a coding practice concern rather than an immediate security vulnerability.\n- **Issue presence:** No direct malicious code or vulnerabilities are evident in this snippet.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:\n- The reports correctly identify the use of `import *` as a potential concern but often overstate the risk without evidence.\n- They assume that malicious code could be hidden in the module, which is true in principle but cannot be confirmed here.\n- Some reports suggest that the import could execute malicious code if the module is compromised, which is a valid point but speculative without further evidence.\n- The comments about disabling pylint warnings are not security issues per se but reflect coding style choices.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the lack of evidence.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is reasonable; no obfuscation is evident.\n- **Security risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.3, reflecting mild concern about the use of `import *`. This seems appropriate, but given the minimal code, a lower score (e.g., 0.1) might be more justified.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk score higher than 0.3, which is reasonable.\n- If a higher score were suggested, it would need concrete evidence of malicious behavior or a compromised module.\n\n### Potential assumptions:\n- The reports assume that the module `loncapa_check` could be malicious or compromised, which is a valid concern but cannot be confirmed here.\n- They do not assume any actual vulnerabilities or malicious actions in the code snippet itself.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the minimal code and the cautious stance regarding the import method.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal concern due to use of `import *`, but no actual security risk evident.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- Given the minimal code and lack of evidence, I would assign:\n  - **Malware:** 0\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0\n  - **Risk:** 0.1 (due to the potential issues with `import *`, but no concrete risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code snippet itself is benign. The primary concern is the use of `import *`, which can hide malicious code if the imported module is compromised. Without access to `loncapa_check`, we cannot determine if it contains malicious code. The current scores and reasoning are appropriate, but overall, the risk remains very low.\n\n**Final note:** Always review the contents of imported modules, especially when using wildcard imports, to ensure no malicious code is present.",
