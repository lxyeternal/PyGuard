  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign; no malicious activity is evident. The main concern is the use of 'import *', which can hide malicious code if the imported module is compromised. Scores are consistent with the minimal code and potential risks. Further review of 'loncapa_check' is advised to ensure its integrity."
