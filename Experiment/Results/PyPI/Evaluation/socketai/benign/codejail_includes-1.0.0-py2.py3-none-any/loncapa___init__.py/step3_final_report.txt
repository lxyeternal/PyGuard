{
  "purpose": "Minimal Python module import statement, likely to include functions or classes from 'loncapa_check' for use in the current module.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from .loncapa_check import *' reads symbols from the local module 'loncapa_check'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident; the import brings symbols into the namespace but does not involve data processing or transmission.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' from a local module; no evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or unusual code patterns in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is a shebang, a comment, and a wildcard import from a local module. No malicious behavior or vulnerabilities are visible. The primary concern is the use of 'import *', which can obscure imported symbols and potentially hide malicious code if the module is compromised. Scores for malware and obfuscation are appropriately zero. The security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting the import style's potential to hide malicious code but no evidence of such in this snippet. Confidence in benign assessment is high (0.8), but the risk associated with the import method warrants cautious interpretation. Overall, the code is benign, with the main recommendation to avoid wildcard imports for clarity and security.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign; no malicious activity is evident. The main concern is the use of 'import *', which can hide malicious code if the imported module is compromised. Scores are consistent with the minimal code and potential risks. Further review of 'loncapa_check' is advised to ensure its integrity.",
