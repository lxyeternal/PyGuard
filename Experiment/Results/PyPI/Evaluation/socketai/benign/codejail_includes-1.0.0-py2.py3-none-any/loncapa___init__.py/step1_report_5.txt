{
  "purpose": "Import all functions and classes from the module 'loncapa_check' within the same package",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from .loncapa_check import *'",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present in this snippet",
  "flows": "Import statement potentially imports all code from 'loncapa_check' module, which could include malicious code if the module is compromised or malicious",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' is generally discouraged and can obscure what code is being executed, but it is not inherently malicious; no other anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'loncapa_check' module using a relative import and wildcard import. This pattern can hide imported code behaviors and make static analysis more difficult. However, the snippet alone does not reveal malicious activity or anomalies. The import could potentially execute malicious code if 'loncapa_check' is compromised or contains malicious code, but there is no direct evidence here. The file is minimal and primarily responsible for importing functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard import statement with no evident malicious intent or security risks on its own. The potential concern lies in the contents of 'loncapa_check', which are not provided. The code itself is benign but could be risky depending on the integrity of the imported module.",
