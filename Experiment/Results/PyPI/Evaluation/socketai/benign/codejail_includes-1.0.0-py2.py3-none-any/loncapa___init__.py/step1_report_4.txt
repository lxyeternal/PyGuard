  "purpose": "Import all contents from the module 'loncapa_check' in the current package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the current package, specifically 'from .loncapa_check import *'.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no direct data sinks such as network, file, or system calls are shown.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable in this snippet since it only contains an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import 'import *' which can hide imported symbols, making code harder to audit and potentially hiding malicious code or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only shebang, comments, and an import statement from a local module. The wildcard import may be suspicious as it can import unintended or malicious symbols if the module is compromised. However, with only this snippet, no actual malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities are directly observable. The lack of other code limits assessment; no network or system operations are visible.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is minimal and does not demonstrate malicious behavior, but the use of 'import *' is a poor practice that can obscure security issues. No immediate malicious activity is evident from this fragment.",
