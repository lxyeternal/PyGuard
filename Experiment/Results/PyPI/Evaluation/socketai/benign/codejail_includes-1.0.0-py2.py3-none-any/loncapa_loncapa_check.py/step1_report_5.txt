{
  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for random number generation and selection, and define degree-radian conversion constants, used in LON-CAPA problem translation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function arguments and the random module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs are present; functions return calculated values based on inputs.",
  "flows": "Input arguments are processed within functions; no external data or untrusted sources flow into sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code detected. The functions are straightforward and serve utility purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for random number generation (`lc_random`) and selection (`lc_choose`) using only the standard `random` module. It includes degree-radian conversion constants. No external data sources, network activity, or insecure operations are evident. The functions do not perform any malicious actions or harmful operations. There is no use of obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious logic. The code appears benign and intended for mathematical or randomization utility purposes within a problem translation context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It is safe to use in its current form.",
