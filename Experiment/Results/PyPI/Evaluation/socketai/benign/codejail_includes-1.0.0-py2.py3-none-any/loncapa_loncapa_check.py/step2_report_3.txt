  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-reference with the provided code.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward utility functions for random number generation (`lc_random`) and argument selection (`lc_choose`).\n- The code imports only standard libraries (`math`, `random`, `six.moves`) and defines constants for angle conversions.\n- No external data input, network activity, or file operations are present.\n- The try-except block in `lc_choose` suppresses exceptions silently, which could mask errors but does not introduce malicious behavior.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The functions are simple, serve internal utility purposes, and do not perform any harmful actions.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the analysis that there's no malicious activity.\n- The security risks are minimal, mostly due to the silent exception handling, which is a coding concern but not a security risk.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or 1.0), indicating the reviewers agree on benignity.\n\n**Score justification:**\n- The malware scores are appropriately 0, as there's no evidence of malicious intent.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, matching the clear and straightforward code.\n- The overall security risk scores are low (~0.1 to 0.2), reflecting minor concerns about error handling but not actual security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is benign utility code with no security risks or malware.\n- The scores given are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal risk due to silent exception handling, but not security-critical)\n\n**Final note:** The code appears safe, well-understood, and suitable for its purpose within the larger system.",
