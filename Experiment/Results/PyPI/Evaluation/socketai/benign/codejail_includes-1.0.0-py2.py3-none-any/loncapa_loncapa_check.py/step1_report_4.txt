{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for random number generation and selection, likely used in LON-CAPA problem translation scripts.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters (lower, upper, stepsize, index) and internal constants.",
  "sinks": "Uses the 'random.choice' function which can select from generated choices; no external data sinks or network calls are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (lower, upper, stepsize, index) flow into calculations and decision branches; 'random.choice' consumes the choices list.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are observed. Functions are straightforward utility implementations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom random function 'lc_random' that generates a list of values and randomly selects one, which appears benign. The 'lc_choose' function safely returns an argument based on index with error handling. The constants for degree-radian conversions are standard. There are no external calls, network operations, or data leaks. No suspicious patterns or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical utility script providing randomization and selection functions without malicious intent. No signs of malware or security risks are evident.",
