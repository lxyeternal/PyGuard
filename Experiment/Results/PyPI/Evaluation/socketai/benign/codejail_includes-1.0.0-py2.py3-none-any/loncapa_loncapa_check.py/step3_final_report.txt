  "purpose": "Utility functions for random number generation and argument selection, used in translating LON-CAPA problems.",
  "sources": "Function parameters and internal calculations; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data leaks, network activity, or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "In-memory calculations within functions; no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Silent exception handling in 'lc_choose' masks errors but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple utility functions with straightforward logic, using only standard libraries. No external data handling, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. The silent try-except in 'lc_choose' could hide errors but does not pose security risks. The constants for angle conversions are benign. Overall, the code is benign, with no obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, benign utility code with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score (around 0.1) is appropriate given the silent error handling. The malware score is correctly 0, and the obfuscated score is 0. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent.",
