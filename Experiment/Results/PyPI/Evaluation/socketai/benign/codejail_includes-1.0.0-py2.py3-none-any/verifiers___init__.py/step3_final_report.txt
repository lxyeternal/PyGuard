  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, parameters, files, network resources, dynamic code execution functions (eval()/exec()), hardcoded credentials.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file writes, environment modifications, dynamic code execution, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or input flow into processing functions, potentially leading to network transmission, file modifications, or backdoors via eval()/exec().",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded credentials, dynamic execution functions, obfuscation, unusual variable names, suspicious network domains, or code patterns that suggest concealment.",
  "analysis": "The code in Report 1-4 appears benign, straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation, justified by high confidence (0.9) and low malware/risk scores. Report 5 indicates suspicious elements such as hardcoded credentials, eval()/exec(), obfuscation, and potential data exfiltration, justifying higher scores (malware=0.6, obfuscated=0.6, securityRisk=0.75). The reasoning aligns with typical indicators of malicious or backdoored code. Without actual code snippets, these assessments rely on descriptions, but they are consistent with standard security signals.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports describe benign code with appropriate low scores. Report 5 presents suspicious patterns, justifying elevated malware and risk scores. The scoring scheme is consistent with the described behaviors. Unless concrete code evidence contradicts these descriptions, the scores are justified and accurate.",
