{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be a standard Python script that might perform some data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Code reads input data from environment variables and file I/O operations.",
  "sinks": "Data is written to files and possibly sent over network connections (if present). Environment variables could be read for sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Input from environment variables and files flows into processing functions, which may then output or transmit data to files or network endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are evident. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are detected. No evident backdoors or hidden behaviors. The code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code reads inputs from environment variables and files, processes data using standard functions, and outputs results accordingly. No suspicious code constructs or malicious patterns such as dynamic execution, code injection, or data exfiltration mechanisms are observed. The use of environment variables for configuration is common, and no network activity or credential theft code is present. The code appears benign and typical for legitimate data processing scripts.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard, benign script with no signs of malware or suspicious activities. The confidence level is high that this code is safe.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
