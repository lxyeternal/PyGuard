{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a grader for drag-and-drop input, comparing user responses to correct answers based on positions or target identifiers.",
  "sources": "JSON parsing of user input, reading 'draggable' data, and internal data structures for correct answers and user responses.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code processes data in memory without external system interaction or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Input JSON is parsed into data structures; user answers are flattened; data is compared via position and target matching functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code performs standard JSON parsing, data normalization, and comparison logic without obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code safely parses JSON input, normalizes nested answer structures, and compares positions using straightforward algorithms. No external calls, code injection, or obfuscation are present. The comparison functions handle positional tolerance and string matching appropriately. The only minor concern is the potential for large or malicious JSON inputs causing performance issues, but this does not constitute malicious behavior. Overall, the code is transparent, well-structured, and free of security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for grading drag-and-drop responses. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The minimal security concern relates to parsing untrusted JSON inputs, which is common and manageable. Therefore, the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is very low (0.1) to reflect the minimal potential for issues with untrusted input size.",
