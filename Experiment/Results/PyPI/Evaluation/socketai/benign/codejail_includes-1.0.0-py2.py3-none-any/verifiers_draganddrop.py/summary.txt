  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for grading drag-and-drop responses. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The minimal security concern relates to parsing untrusted JSON inputs, which is common and manageable. Therefore, the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is very low (0.1) to reflect the minimal potential for issues with untrusted input size."
