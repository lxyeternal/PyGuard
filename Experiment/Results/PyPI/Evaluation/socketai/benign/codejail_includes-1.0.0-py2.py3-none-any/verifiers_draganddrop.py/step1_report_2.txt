{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to grade drag-and-drop input answers, comparing user-provided positions and target assignments against correct answers for an interactive task.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the 'user_answer' JSON string passed to 'grade' function, which is parsed into data structures; also, 'correct_answer' can be provided as a dict or list.",
  "sinks": "Data is processed internally; no explicit data sinks such as network calls, file writes, or system commands are present. No untrusted data is written or transmitted externally.",
  "flows": "The user input flows from JSON parsing into data structures, through 'flat_user_answer' and 'PositionsCompare' for comparison, ultimately leading to a boolean result from 'DragAndDrop.grade()'. No external system interactions are observed.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not contain any suspicious or unusual constructs; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or code obfuscation. It relies solely on standard Python libraries and explicit data processing. No dynamic execution or misleading variable usage detected.",
  "analysis": "The script processes user drag-and-drop answers and compares them against correct configurations. It employs safe JSON parsing, standard data comparisons, and position calculations. No network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration code is present. The only concern might be if the input data is maliciously crafted to cause performance issues (e.g., very large inputs), but such cases are outside the scope of malicious code and more about input validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, safe implementation for grading drag-and-drop interactions. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. It functions solely within the local environment, comparing structured data without external interactions.",
