  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard drag-and-drop answer grader with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Analysis:** No external system calls, no hidden code, no obfuscation. The code processes data in memory with standard libraries.\n- **Verdict:** The assessment is accurate. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code safely processes user input and correct answers, with no external system interaction.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Analysis:** Safe JSON parsing, no external calls, straightforward comparison logic.\n- **Verdict:** Correct. No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is designed for grading, with safe data handling, no network or system calls.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Analysis:** Uses standard parsing and comparison, no dynamic code execution or obfuscation.\n- **Verdict:** Valid assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code performs data parsing and comparison with minimal external influence.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (slightly elevated)\n- **Analysis:** The only minor concern is the JSON parsing, which is standard. The small security risk might be due to potential parsing of malicious JSON, but this is common and generally safe if input validation is in place.\n- **Verdict:** Overall safe; the security risk score can be considered negligible.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard answer grader with no malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Analysis:** No external system calls, no obfuscation, standard data handling.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0. The code does not execute any malicious code, network calls, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports agree on 0. The code is transparent, well-structured, and uses standard libraries.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slightly elevated in report 4 (0.1), likely due to JSON parsing of untrusted input. However, this is a common and generally safe operation if inputs are validated. Given the context, the risk remains minimal.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect the minimal potential for issues with untrusted JSON input, but not a serious concern)\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard, safe implementation for grading drag-and-drop interactions.** There are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Estimated Score |\n|----------------|-----------------|\n| Malware        | 0               |\n| Obfuscated     | 0               |\n| Security Risk  | 0.1             |\n\nThis conservative estimate aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus among the reports.",
