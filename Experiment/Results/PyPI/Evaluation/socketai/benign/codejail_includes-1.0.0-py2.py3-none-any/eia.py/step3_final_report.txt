{
  "purpose": "Validate resistor values against standard EIA series to ensure they are within recognized ranges.",
  "sources": "Input resistor value 'r' provided to the iseia() function.",
  "sinks": "Membership checks against resistor series lists; no external data or system effects.",
  "flows": "Input 'r' is normalized to range [100, 1000), then checked against series lists for validity.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior; straightforward numeric validation and list membership checks.",
  "analysis": "The code performs input validation, normalization, and membership testing against predefined resistor series lists (E6, E12, E24, E48, E96, E192). It handles edge cases such as zero and non-numeric inputs. No external calls, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The logic is transparent and standard for resistor value validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for resistor value validation with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The minor security risk score in one report (0.1) is unjustified and should be adjusted to 0.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
