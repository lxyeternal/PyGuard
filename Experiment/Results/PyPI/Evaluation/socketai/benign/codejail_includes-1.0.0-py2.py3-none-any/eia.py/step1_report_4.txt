{
  "purpose": "The code defines standard resistor values and provides a function to verify if a resistor value matches standard EIA value series for electronic components.",
  "sources": "Reads resistor values passed as function argument 'r'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code does not write or transmit data externally.",
  "flows": "Input 'r' is validated and normalized; no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The code is straightforward and only handles resistor value validation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines multiple resistor value series, and provides a function 'iseia' to check if a given resistor value 'r' is valid according to standard EIA series. The function checks input validity, normalizes the value into a specific range, ensures the value is an integer or close to it, and then verifies its membership in standard series lists. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, data exfiltration, or malware behavior. The code is purely computational, intended for resistor validation, with no external network or system interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, focused solely on resistor value validation, with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any harmful operations or external data transmission. It is a straightforward utility function for electronic component validation.",
