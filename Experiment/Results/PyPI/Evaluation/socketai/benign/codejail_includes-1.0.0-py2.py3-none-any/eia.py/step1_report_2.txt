{
  "purpose": "Defines standard resistor values for electronic components and provides a utility function to verify if a given resistor value matches EIA standard values.",
  "sources": "Reads input resistor value 'r' in the iseia() function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data processing, data leakage, or dangerous operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'r' is validated and normalized, then checked against predefined resistor value lists to confirm validity.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are present. The function performs straightforward validation logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of predefined resistor value lists and a function 'iseia' that validates whether a given resistor value is part of these standard series. The validation includes type checks, value normalization within a certain range, and list membership checks. There are no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior. The code is well-structured for its purpose, with no obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for validating resistor values against standard EIA series and contains no malicious or security-compromising elements. It is safe and intended for use in electronic component verification.",
