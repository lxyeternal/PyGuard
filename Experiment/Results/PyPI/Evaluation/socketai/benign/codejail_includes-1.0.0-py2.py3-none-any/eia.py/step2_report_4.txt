  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their conclusions with the code's content.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is a straightforward resistor value validation utility.\n- It contains predefined resistor series lists (E6, E12, E24, E48, E96, E192).\n- The `iseia()` function normalizes input values, performs validation, and checks membership against these lists.\n- No external data sources, network calls, file I/O, or system modifications are present.\n- No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are evident.\n- The purpose is purely to verify resistor values.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Validates resistor values against EIA standards.\n- Conclusion: Benign, no malicious behavior.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- Confidence: 1\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is benign, and the report's conclusion aligns with the code content.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Conclusion: Benign, no malicious behavior.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- Confidence: 1\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Conclusion: Benign, straightforward validation.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- Confidence: 1\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The logic is standard and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Conclusion: Benign, no malicious intent.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1\n- Confidence: 1.0\n\n**Assessment:** The security risk score is slightly elevated at 0.1, but given the code's benign nature, this seems unwarranted. The code performs simple numeric validation and list membership checks, with no external or malicious behaviors. The slight increase in risk score is unjustified and should be lowered to 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Conclusion: Benign, no malicious intent.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- Confidence: 1\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is safe and purpose-specific.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- **Code presence:** No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Scores:** All reports correctly identify the benign nature.\n- **Risk scores:** Only Report 4 has a slightly elevated security risk score (0.1), which is inconsistent with the benign analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware scores:** Should be 0 across all reports.\n- **Security risk scores:** Should be 0 across all reports, including Report 4.\n- **Obfuscated flag:** Correctly 0 in all cases.\n- **Confidence:** Correctly high (1) in all cases.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a simple resistor validation utility with no malicious intent. The scores should reflect this.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code's logic is transparent, safe, and serves a clear purpose. No adjustments are necessary beyond standardizing the risk scores to 0.",
