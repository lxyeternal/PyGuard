{
  "purpose": "Defines standard resistor values and provides a function to validate if a resistor value conforms to common EIA standard series, used for electronic component verification.",
  "sources": "Reads only input parameter 'r' in the function 'iseia'. No other data sources or external inputs are read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or output operations that could leak data or cause side effects. The function returns a boolean value based on internal logic.",
  "flows": "Input 'r' flows through validation steps; no external or untrusted data flows into or out of the system; no data is transmitted externally or stored.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and pertains solely to resistor value validation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several resistor series values, then provides a validation function 'iseia' that checks if a given resistor value is part of these standard series. The function ensures 'r' is a number, within reasonable bounds, scales it to a standard range, and verifies whether it matches accepted resistor values. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or hidden behaviors. The function does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or data theft. The purpose appears purely to validate resistor values against EIA standards.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, purpose-specific, and contains no malicious intent. It performs standard validation of resistor values against known series and includes no suspicious or malicious behaviors.",
