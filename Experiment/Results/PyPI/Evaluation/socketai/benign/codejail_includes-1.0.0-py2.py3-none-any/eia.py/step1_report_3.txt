{
  "purpose": "The code provides standard resistor values and a utility function to verify if a given resistor value conforms to EIA standard values for electronic components.",
  "sources": "The function iseia(r, valid_types) reads the input parameter 'r', which is expected to be a numeric resistor value.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in the code; it performs validation and returns a boolean result. No data is written, transmitted, or stored in a potentially malicious way.",
  "flows": "Input 'r' flows through validation steps: type and value checks, normalization to a specific range, and comparison against predefined standard values.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with no signs of obfuscation, hidden behaviors, or malicious constructs. It does not perform network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration. The only notable aspect is its purpose to validate resistor values, which is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several standard resistor value lists per EIA specifications and a validation function 'iseia'. The function first filters out non-numeric, NaN, or infinite inputs. It handles zero as a valid resistor. Then, it normalizes the input to a range between 100 and 1000 by scaling. It checks if the value is approximately an integer within a small margin, then rounds it. Finally, it compares the value against standard resistor value lists, considering the possible multiplication or division by 10 factors, to determine validity. All steps are typical for such validation and do not involve any suspicious or malicious behavior. There are no obfuscated parts or suspicious code flows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for validating resistor values against standard EIA series. There is no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or malware. It performs straightforward mathematical validation without side effects.",
