{
  "purpose": "The code provides standard resistor values and a utility function to verify if a resistor value conforms to EIA standard values for electronic components.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from numeric inputs provided to the iseia() function and predefined lists of resistor values.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows that could lead to data leakage, external communication, or other security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Input numeric value passed to iseia() is processed and compared against resistor standard value lists; no external or untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs straightforward validation and list checks without any obfuscated code, hidden behaviors, or malicious constructs. No hardcoded credentials, system commands, or external calls are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines resistor value lists for various E-series standards and provides a function iseia() to validate if a given resistor value matches these standards after normalization. The validation involves type checking, value normalization, and list membership testing. No external data sources, no network or file I/O, and no dynamic code execution are present. The code appears to serve its purpose without malicious intent. It does not include any suspicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, designed solely for resistor value validation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It provides useful functionality without any indicators of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
