{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for managing AWS CloudFormation stacks, including creation, updating, deletion, and listing stacks with pagination support.",
  "sources": "Parameters from function calls (e.g., StackName, ChangeSetName), AWS SDK responses (describe_stacks, describe_stack_events, etc.), and internal variables (e.g., timestamps for change set names).",
  "sinks": "AWS SDK API calls that modify or query cloud resources; logging outputs for status and errors.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into AWS SDK calls; responses from AWS are processed and logged; error handling may trigger retries or deletions.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected. Use of timestamp for change set names is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of AWS CloudFormation stack management functions, including create, update, delete, and list operations. It handles common errors, uses AWS waiters for synchronization, and logs status updates. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows are present. The functions operate on parameters and AWS responses without processing untrusted user input in a malicious way. The logic aligns with standard AWS SDK usage, and error handling is appropriate. The code does not contain backdoors, network exfiltration, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard utility for managing AWS CloudFormation stacks. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the security risk score remains minimal, reflecting operational considerations rather than security threats.",
