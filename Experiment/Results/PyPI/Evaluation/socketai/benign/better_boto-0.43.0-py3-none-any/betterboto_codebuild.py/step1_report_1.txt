{
  "purpose": "The code provides a utility to start an AWS CodeBuild build and wait for its completion, extending the client with a custom method.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function parameters (`self`, `kwargs`, `client`) and AWS API responses (`start_build`, `batch_get_builds`, build data).",
  "sinks": "The code calls AWS SDK methods (`start_build`, `batch_get_builds`), which are safe and expected; no direct sink for untrusted data or malicious actions is evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to initiate builds, and build status is polled periodically; data flows from AWS responses to control logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or backdoors are present. The method merely wraps existing AWS SDK calls for convenience.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a function to start an AWS CodeBuild project and poll its status until completion, then adds this method to a client object via dynamic binding. It uses standard library modules (`types`, `logging`, `time`) and AWS SDK methods without modifying or injecting malicious code. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code performs legitimate operations typical of SDK wrapper functions. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility function that extends an AWS SDK client with a method to manage build processes synchronously. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security threats.",
