{
  "purpose": "The code extends an AWS CodeBuild client with a method to start a build and wait for its completion.",
  "sources": "self.start_build() and self.batch_get_builds() methods, and the 'kwargs' parameter for input data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network transmissions, file writes, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (kwargs) passed to start_build, then status polled via batch_get_builds, with logs generated.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns; straightforward wrapper to AWS SDK calls. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to start an AWS CodeBuild job and poll until completion, then dynamically attaches it as a method to the client object. It uses standard AWS SDK methods with no unusual or malicious constructs. No input validation issues or data leaks are apparent. The code appears to be a benign utility function for managing build workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility to manage AWS CodeBuild operations, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not include malicious payloads or backdoors. Overall, it is safe.",
