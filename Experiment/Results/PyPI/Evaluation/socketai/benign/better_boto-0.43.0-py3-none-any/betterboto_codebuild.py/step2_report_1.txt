  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code to determine if the scores and conclusions are appropriate.\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n- The code defines a function to start an AWS CodeBuild build and wait for its completion, polling every 5 seconds.\n- It dynamically attaches this function as a method to an AWS SDK client object.\n- The code uses standard modules (`types`, `logging`, `time`) and AWS SDK calls (`start_build`, `batch_get_builds`).\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads are present.\n- The logic is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Benign utility to extend AWS CodeBuild client.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Confirms benign nature, standard SDK usage.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, SecurityRisk = 0.0\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar extension utility.\n- **Findings:** No untrusted data sinks, no anomalies, no malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis:** Reiterates benign nature, safe for automation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher security risk score (0.1) is reasonable given the code interacts with AWS SDK, but no malicious activity is present.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same extension, similar analysis.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no hardcoded secrets, no malicious constructs.\n- **Analysis:** Straightforward wrapper, no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score (0.2) is acceptable due to the nature of interacting with cloud SDKs, but no malicious behavior is evident.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Same utility, similar analysis.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, no malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis:** Standard polling implementation, no malicious payloads.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n**Assessment:** The low security risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same as others.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious logic, straightforward polling.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n**Assessment:** The scores align with the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation & Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0.0, as there's no evidence of malicious code, payloads, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is accurate; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variations (0.1 to 0.2) are reasonable given the code's interaction with AWS SDKs, which could be misused if misconfigured, but no actual malicious activity is present.\n\n### **My Overall Assessment:**\n\n- The code is a benign utility function that extends an AWS SDK client with a method to start a build and wait for its completion.\n- There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (to reflect minimal operational risk but no malicious threat)\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, straightforward, and intended for legitimate automation. The scores should reflect that with zero malware and obfuscation scores, and a very low security risk score.\n\n---\n\n**Work through each report and conclusion step-by-step to ensure comprehensive understanding and accurate scoring.**",
