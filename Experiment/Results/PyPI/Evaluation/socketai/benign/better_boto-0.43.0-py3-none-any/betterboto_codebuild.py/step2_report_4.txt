  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a benign utility wrapping AWS SDK calls, extending a client with a method to start and wait for build completion.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.0 — no evident security issues.\n- **Comments:** The report correctly identifies the code as a standard, safe utility. No issues here.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with a focus on the lack of untrusted data sinks or malicious patterns.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — very low, just a utility function.\n- **Comments:** The reasoning aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, a straightforward wrapper for AWS SDK calls, no malicious intent.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — no malware.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — minimal, related to potential misconfiguration but not inherent in code.\n- **Comments:** The assessment is consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Similar conclusion; the code is a utility with no malicious patterns.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1\n- **Comments:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, standard polling and build management logic.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n- **Comments:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- **Code presence:** The code matches the description—it's a utility to extend an AWS SDK client with a method to start and wait for build completion.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Security risk:** Very low; primarily related to AWS SDK usage, which is standard.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** Given the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns, I would assign a **malware score of 0.0**.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Confirmed as 0.0.\n- **Risk score:** Since the code is a simple utility with no security flaws or malicious intent, a **risk score of 0.0** is appropriate.\n\n**Additional notes:** The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. The only minor point is the security risk score; some reports assign 0.1 or 0.2, but given the benign nature, 0.0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n- **Malware score:** **0.0**\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.0**\n- **Risk score:** **0.0**\n\nThis code is a safe, standard utility for managing AWS CodeBuild operations, with no indicators of malicious or obfuscated code.",
