{
  "purpose": "Enhance an AWS CodeBuild client with a method to start a build and wait for its completion.",
  "sources": "Input data is retrieved from the 'self.start_build' method call and 'batch_get_builds' response.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data accessed includes build IDs and build status, but no untrusted external data handling or output is present.",
  "flows": "The method calls 'start_build' to initiate a build (source), then repeatedly calls 'batch_get_builds' to monitor status (sink), with status checks forming the flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious logic, or unusual code structures observed. The code implements a straightforward pattern for polling build status.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to start an AWS CodeBuild build and poll until completion. It uses standard boto3 methods, dynamically adds this as a method to the client object, and logs build status updates. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or data exfiltration. The sleep interval is benign and typical for such polling mechanisms. No external network calls other than AWS SDK methods are involved. No credentials or sensitive data handling beyond AWS SDK usage is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility to extend a boto3 client with build-wait functionality. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. It appears safe and intended for standard AWS build monitoring.",
