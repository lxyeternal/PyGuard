  "purpose": "Extend an AWS CodeBuild client with a method to start a build and wait for its completion.",
  "sources": "Calls to self.start_build and self.batch_get_builds, which interact with AWS SDK and external AWS services.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "start_build initiates build; batch_get_builds polls build status; no data flows to external untrusted destinations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility that uses standard AWS SDK calls to manage build processes. It dynamically attaches a method to a client object without any malicious patterns or obfuscation. The logic involves polling for build status, which is common practice. No signs of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code's simplicity and clarity further support its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for managing AWS CodeBuild builds, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate: malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk=0.1, reflecting minimal operational risk but no threat.",
