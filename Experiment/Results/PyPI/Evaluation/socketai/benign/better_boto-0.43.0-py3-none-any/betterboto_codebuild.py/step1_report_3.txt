  "purpose": "Enhance an AWS CodeBuild client with a method to start a build and wait for its completion",
  "sources": "Input data is received through method arguments (kwargs) for starting builds; build ID is extracted from AWS response",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain explicit data sinks; it interacts with AWS SDK, which could potentially be used maliciously if misconfigured",
  "flows": "start_build is called with kwargs; build ID is obtained; polling via batch_get_builds retrieves build status; no untrusted data flows into sensitive operations",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; code simply wraps AWS SDK calls, uses standard Python features",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to initiate an AWS CodeBuild project build and poll until completion. It then dynamically adds this function as a method to a client object using types.MethodType. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The code relies on external AWS SDK methods and standard Python modules. There are no indications of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility to extend an AWS CodeBuild client with a method to start and wait for build completion. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior, and poses no significant security risks. It appears safe and intended for legitimate automation purposes.",
