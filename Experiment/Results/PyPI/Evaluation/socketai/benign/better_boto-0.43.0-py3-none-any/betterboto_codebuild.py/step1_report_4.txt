{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to start an AWS CodeBuild build and wait for its completion, extending the client with this functionality.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted data sources are read; the code interacts with AWS SDK methods and internal parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data leading to leaks or malicious effects are present; the code performs AWS API calls.",
  "flows": "The flow involves calling start_build, polling build status via batch_get_builds, and logging status updates. No untrusted data flows to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated elements. It does not perform any unusual or malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to initiate an AWS CodeBuild build and waits until the build is no longer in progress, polling every 5 seconds and logging status updates. It then provides a function to attach this method to a client object via dynamic method binding. The logic appears to be a standard implementation for asynchronous build management. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code injections, are present. The code does not handle or log any sensitive data or credentials. It uses common Python patterns and AWS SDK interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for managing AWS CodeBuild builds with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It performs expected operations with no suspicious patterns.",
