  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and any potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a benign utility that adds a method to start and wait for an AWS CodeBuild build to complete. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are identified.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0.0, obfuscated = 0.0, securityRisk = 0.0, confidence = 1.0\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code is straightforward, uses standard SDK calls, and contains no suspicious patterns. The scores are appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is a utility to manage AWS CodeBuild builds, with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0.0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.1, confidence = 0.9\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.1) possibly due to the mention of interaction with AWS SDK, but since no untrusted data or vulnerabilities are present, this is acceptable. The malware score remains zero.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reasoning is consistent; the minor securityRisk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code is a straightforward wrapper around AWS SDK calls, with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.2, confidence = 0.9\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.2) might reflect cautiousness about external SDK interactions, but given the code's nature, this is acceptable. Malware remains zero.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scores are reasonable; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar assessment—utility for managing AWS CodeBuild, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.1, confidence = 0.9\n- **Assessment:** The low securityRisk score aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a benign utility with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.2, confidence = 0.9\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; no issues detected.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** None of the reports identify actual code issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious activity. All recognize the code as a standard AWS SDK wrapper.\n- **Scores consistency:** All malware scores are zero, which is appropriate given the benign nature. Obfuscated scores are zero, as expected.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slight variations (0.1 or 0.2) reflect cautiousness about external SDK interactions, but given the context, these are reasonable.\n- **Potential concerns:** No evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The code is straightforward and standard.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is justified.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** Given the benign nature, a low risk score (around 0.1 to 0.2) is appropriate, reflecting minimal concern.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0.0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — minimal risk, primarily due to external SDK interactions, but no vulnerabilities.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a benign, standard utility function for AWS CodeBuild management. No malicious or security issues are evident.",
