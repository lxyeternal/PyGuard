{
  "purpose": "This function iteratively retrieves paginated responses from a provided API or data source, accumulating results across multiple pages until completion.",
  "sources": "The function reads input parameters via **kwargs, particularly for the request parameters and optional logging prefix. It also calls the provided 'func' with these parameters to fetch responses.",
  "sinks": "The function does not write untrusted data to external systems or files, nor does it process untrusted data insecurely. It mainly logs information and returns combined responses.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are passed via **kwargs; 'func' is invoked with these parameters; responses are accumulated and request parameters are updated for subsequent iterations; logs are generated for tracing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are present. The use of deep copy for kwargs and logging prefix handling appears standard. No malicious or unusual behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a paginated response collector, calling a provided function repeatedly while updating request parameters based on response tokens. It logs the process for debugging or monitoring. The loop continues until no next token is provided. The code uses safe practices such as deep copying inputs, avoiding mutation of original arguments, and includes sleep delays. No unsafe code, data leaks, or malicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward utility for paginating API responses, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as intended without obfuscated or malicious code. There are no malicious behaviors or supply chain security concerns detected.",
