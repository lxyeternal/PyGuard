  "flows": "API call via self.describe_budgets -> slurp processes response -> returns aggregated data.",
  "anomalies": "Repeated empty responses ('') in raw_response, indicating possible API issues or improper handling of empty responses.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward pagination wrapper that relies on an external utility 'slurp' to handle API responses. The reports show consistent empty responses, which could be due to API misconfiguration, network issues, or the 'slurp' utility not handling empty responses properly. No malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The main concern is robustness in handling empty responses, not security. The code itself is clear and does not perform any malicious actions. The scores should be low: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1, assuming the empty responses are external or operational issues rather than security threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The repeated empty responses are likely external API or network issues rather than security vulnerabilities. The primary recommendation is to verify the 'slurp' implementation and API configuration to handle empty responses gracefully. Overall, the security risk is minimal, and the code is safe.",
