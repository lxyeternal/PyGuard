  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for extending a client SDK with pagination support. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The dynamic method assignment is typical in SDK extensions and poses no security threat. The overall security risk is negligible, and the malware likelihood is zero."
