The code uses standard Python modules and a custom 'slurp' utility, which likely handles pagination. There are no signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The use of dynamic method assignment is common and not suspicious in this context. No suspicious external calls, environment variable misuse, or obfuscation are present.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"The code appears to be a legitimate utility for paginating API responses.
