{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions to interact with AWS SSM Parameter Store, including putting parameters with confirmation, retrieving parameter history, and fetching specific parameter versions.",
  "sources": "Functions read input parameters (e.g., Name, Version, kwargs), and interact with the SSM client methods (put_parameter, get_parameter, get_parameter_history).",
  "sinks": "Methods call external AWS APIs (put_parameter, get_parameter, get_parameter_history), which could be exploited if untrusted input is passed, but these are standard SDK calls without malicious intent.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., Name, Version) are passed into AWS SDK calls. No direct flow from untrusted sources to sinks suggests no malicious data flow present. No code writes to files, network, or other sensitive endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The code uses standard SDK method calls and exception handling. No obfuscation, no suspicious code logic, and no hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements typical AWS parameter store interactions, including retries and pagination, using standard Python libraries and SDK patterns. No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious intent observed. Exception handling is appropriate, and no unsafe data handling or external connections beyond AWS SDK are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility module for AWS SSM Parameter Store interactions with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It is well-structured, and no security risks are evident based on this code alone.",
