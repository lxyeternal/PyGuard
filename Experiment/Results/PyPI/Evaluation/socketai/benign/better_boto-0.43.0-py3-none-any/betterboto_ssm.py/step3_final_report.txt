  "purpose": "Utility functions for AWS SSM parameter management, including put with wait, retrieve history, and get specific version.",
  "sources": "Calls to AWS SDK methods: put_parameter, get_parameter, get_parameter_history, get_paginator, and get_parameter_version; data read from AWS responses and parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data exfiltration or malicious network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to AWS SDK calls; responses processed locally; no external or untrusted data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "Use of types.MethodType to dynamically attach methods to client object is unusual but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard AWS SDK wrapper functions with retries, pagination, and version retrieval. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors. Exception handling is standard. The dynamic method attachment is unconventional but benign. No external data leaks or malicious activities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for AWS SSM parameter management. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores assigned by the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
