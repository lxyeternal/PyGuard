  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the provided scores.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Utility functions wrapping AWS SSM parameter store operations.\n- Includes retries with sleep, pagination, and version retrieval.\n- Uses standard AWS SDK methods.\n- Dynamically attaches methods to a client object.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Utility functions for AWS SSM parameters.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, standard SDK usage.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable. The low risk score aligns with the benign nature.\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar utility functions, focusing on retries and versioning.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, standard SDK, exception handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. Slightly higher risk due to method extension but still benign.\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Similar, with emphasis on pagination and version fetching.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, standard patterns, dynamic method attachment is unusual but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Valid. No malicious indicators.\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Utility functions, including retries, pagination, and versioning.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, dynamic method extension is normal in some contexts.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Similar utility functions, no suspicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, standard SDK calls.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variations (0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal security concern, which is reasonable given the utility nature of the code.\n\n### **Potential Adjustments:**\n\n- The code uses `types.MethodType` to attach methods dynamically. While unusual, this pattern is not inherently malicious. It might warrant a slightly higher risk score (e.g., 0.3) in some contexts, but given the benign analysis, keeping it at 0.2 is acceptable.\n- The overall security risk is low, and no reports suggest vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports — correct.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports — correct.\n- **Risk Score:** Remain at 0.2 for reports 2-4; 0.1 for report 1, and 0 for report 5 is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n**Malware:** 0 — no evidence of malicious code.  \n**Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.  \n**Risk:** 0.2 — low, but acknowledging dynamic method attachment and retries.\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments, confirming that the code is a benign utility module with no security risks or malware.",
