{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for interacting with AWS SSM parameters, including putting, retrieving, and versioning parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads parameter names and version numbers from function arguments and responses, and possibly retrieves parameters from AWS SSM.",
  "sinks": "Calls to AWS SDK methods (put_parameter, get_parameter, get_parameter_history, get_paginator), which are standard AWS API interactions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (Name, Version) flow into AWS SDK methods; responses are processed and returned, with no external untrusted data flow apparent.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. Use of sleep for polling is typical. No obfuscated code detected. Exception handling is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of utility functions wrapping AWS SSM parameter interactions. It includes polling mechanisms for parameter updates, pagination for historical data, and a method to extend an AWS client with these functions. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities are present. The code relies on standard AWS SDK usage with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs. It appears to be a straightforward helper library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for managing AWS SSM parameters. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The functions perform typical operations like polling for parameter updates and paginating through history. No evidence of malware or malicious intent.",
