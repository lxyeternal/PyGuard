  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code to assess consistency, correctness, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n\n- Provides utility functions for AWS SSM parameter management: put with wait, retrieve history, get specific version.\n- Uses standard AWS SDK calls (`put_parameter`, `get_parameter`, `get_parameter_history`, `get_paginator`).\n- Implements polling with retries, pagination, and dynamic method attachment.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- Exception handling appears standard.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or backdoors.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior, straightforward utility functions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Comments:** The low security risk score seems reasonable; the confidence is high (0.9). The functions are standard, and no suspicious activity is detected.\n- **Verdict:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes robustness and standard AWS SDK usage.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Comments:** Slightly higher security risk score but still low, reflecting cautious optimism. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Focuses on the utility nature, no malicious activity, mentions the use of dynamic method attachment as unusual but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Comments:** The analysis aligns with the code. The risk score is appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n- **Verdict:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, highlights the standard SDK usage, no suspicious behaviors.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Comments:** The confidence is high (0.9), and the analysis matches the code's behavior.\n- **Verdict:** Consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Reiterates the utility nature, no malicious activity, standard patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Comments:** Highest confidence (1.0), and no risks detected.\n- **Verdict:** Fully aligned with the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Critical Evaluation & Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign malware=0. Given the code's nature, this is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. No obfuscation is present.\n- **Security Risk:** The scores are very low (0.1–0.2), which seems reasonable. The only potential concern is the dynamic method attachment via `types.MethodType`, which is uncommon but not malicious. It warrants noting but not increasing risk.\n- **Potential Flaws or Assumptions:** All reports correctly identify the code as benign. No assumptions about malicious intent are justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1–0.2 — minor, mostly due to the dynamic method assignment, but overall very low.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — consistent with the reports, reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign utility wrapper around AWS SDK calls for parameter management. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks are present. The scores assigned by the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
