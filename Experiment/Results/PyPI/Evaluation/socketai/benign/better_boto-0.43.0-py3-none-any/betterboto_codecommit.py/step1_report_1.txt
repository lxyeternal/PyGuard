{
  "purpose": "The code extends an AWS CodeCommit client with a method to retrieve all branches across multiple pages, aggregating results.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'list_branches' method of the client and the 'kwargs' passed to the function.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted input into dangerous actions, nor are there data leaks or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input 'kwargs' flow into the 'slurp' function; the 'list_branches' method is called via 'slurp', and the result is returned after aggregation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a wrapper function to paginate through AWS CodeCommit 'list_branches' responses, accumulating all branches into a single list. It dynamically adds this method to a client object. The implementation uses a helper 'slurp' to handle pagination, which is typical for AWS SDK interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code appears safe and standard for this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pagination utility for AWS CodeCommit client, with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It simply extends client functionality without processing untrusted data or performing harmful actions.",
