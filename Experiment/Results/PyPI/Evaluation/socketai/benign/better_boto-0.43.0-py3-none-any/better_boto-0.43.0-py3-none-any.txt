      "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for extending a client SDK with pagination support. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The dynamic method assignment is typical in SDK extensions and poses no security threat. The overall security risk is negligible, and the malware likelihood is zero."

The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate, and the minimal risk score reflects the utility nature and external dependency. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The repeated empty responses are likely external API or network issues rather than security vulnerabilities. The primary recommendation is to verify the 'slurp' implementation and API configuration to handle empty responses gracefully. Overall, the security risk is minimal, and the code is safe."
