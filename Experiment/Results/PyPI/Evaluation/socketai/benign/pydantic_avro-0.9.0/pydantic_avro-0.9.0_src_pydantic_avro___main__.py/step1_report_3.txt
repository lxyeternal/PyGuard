  "purpose": "The script provides a command-line interface for converting Avro schema files to Pydantic models using an external library.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv), particularly the Avro schema file path (--asvc) and optional output path.",
  "sinks": "Passes arguments to the convert_file function, which may read the specified Avro schema file. No other data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Command-line args -> argparse parsing -> convert_file call with schema path and output path.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. The code simply delegates to an imported function without any obfuscated or dynamic code execution. The only external interaction is reading a file path.",
  "analysis": "The script uses argparse to parse command-line input and calls an external conversion function. No suspicious or malicious code appears in this snippet. It does not perform network operations, write to sensitive locations, or execute untrusted code. The import 'convert_file' may perform file processing, but within this script, there's no evidence of malicious activity or data exfiltration. The code is straightforward and clean, adhering to typical CLI patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign command-line utility for schema conversion. No malicious behavior or supply chain risks are evident from the code provided.",
