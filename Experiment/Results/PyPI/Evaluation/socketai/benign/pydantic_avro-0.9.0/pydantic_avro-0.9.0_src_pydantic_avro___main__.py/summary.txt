  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI wrapper that delegates to an external library function. It does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security posture relies on the external convert_file implementation, which cannot be assessed here. Based solely on this code, it is safe, with minimal inherent risk."
