  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script defining package metadata, dependencies, entry points, and package data for 'pydantic-avro'.",
  "sources": "Static variables defining package info, dependencies, entry points, and package data; no external input or dynamic code.",
  "sinks": "None; static configuration data flows into setup() without untrusted data or external effects.",
  "flows": "Static configuration variables passed directly to setup(), no external data or user input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, follows typical packaging conventions, and contains no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup.py script with static, hardcoded package metadata. It imports only standard and third-party libraries without executing dynamic code or handling external input. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe package configuration script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The appropriate scores are malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.",
