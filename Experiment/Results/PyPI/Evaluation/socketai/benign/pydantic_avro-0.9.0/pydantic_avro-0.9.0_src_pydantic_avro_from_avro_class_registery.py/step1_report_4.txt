  "purpose": "A singleton class for storing generated Pydantic class definitions in a registry.",
  "sources": "No explicit data sources or input reading mechanisms present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; the code is straightforward and standard for a singleton registry.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a singleton pattern to store class definitions in a dictionary. It provides methods to add, retrieve, check, and clear classes. No external input handling, network operations, or code execution occurs. No hardcoded secrets, malicious logic, or obfuscation are present. The class appears to be a utility component for code generation or management within a larger application, with no malicious intent evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple singleton registry for storing class definitions, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and benign.",
