  "purpose": "A singleton class to store and manage generated Pydantic class definitions in a registry.",
  "sources": "Method parameters 'name' and 'class_def' in 'add_class'; internal property '_classes'.",
  "sinks": "The '_classes' dictionary where class definitions are stored; no external sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Input from 'add_class' method flows into '_classes' storage; class definitions stored by name.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated code present. No dynamic code execution or external network access.",
  "analysis": "The class implements a singleton pattern with a simple internal dictionary to store class definitions. Methods for adding, retrieving, checking, and clearing classes are straightforward and do not involve external inputs beyond provided parameters. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code appears to serve as a local registry for generated classes, likely in a larger application context. No suspicious or malicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward singleton registry for storing class definitions. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It operates purely as an in-memory data structure with no external communication or malicious logic.",
