  "purpose": "A singleton class to store and manage generated Pydantic class definitions within a registry.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; the code only manages internal data structures.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; there are no data outputs or network operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; there are no external data flows or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Use of class definitions as strings could be a concern if dynamically generated from untrusted sources, but this code does not show such behavior. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a singleton pattern with methods to add, retrieve, check, and clear stored class definitions in a dictionary. It does not perform network I/O, file I/O, or execute any dynamically evaluated code. The class is straightforward and intended for managing class definitions in-memory. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard singleton registry class with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It manages in-memory data without external data handling or risky operations.",
