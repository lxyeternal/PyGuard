  "purpose": "Singleton class to manage and store generated Pydantic class definitions in a registry.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or malicious effects are present.",
  "flows": "The class methods manage internal state; no external data flow or untrusted input handling is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward, implementing a singleton pattern with a simple dictionary. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a singleton class with methods to add, retrieve, check, and clear class definitions stored in a dictionary. No external data input, network communication, or data manipulation that could be malicious is present. The implementation follows standard singleton pattern practices. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard implementation of a singleton registry for storing class definitions, with no apparent malicious intent or security risks.",
