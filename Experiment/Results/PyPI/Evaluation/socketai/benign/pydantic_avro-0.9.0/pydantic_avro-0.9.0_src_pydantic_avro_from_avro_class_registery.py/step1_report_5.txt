{
  "purpose": "A singleton class to manage a registry of generated Pydantic classes, allowing adding, retrieving, checking, and clearing class definitions.",
  "sources": "Input data is provided via method parameters: 'name' and 'class_def' in add_class().",
  "sinks": "The add_class() method stores class definitions into the internal _classes dictionary; no other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'name' and 'class_def' flow into the _classes dictionary through add_class(), with no external data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs observed. The class functions are standard singleton management and dictionary operations.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a singleton pattern to store class definitions in a dictionary. Methods include adding classes, retrieving all classes, checking existence, and clearing the registry. All operations are standard, with no external input processing beyond parameter passing. There are no indications of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior. The design appears straightforward and intended for registry management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard singleton registry for managing class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It operates solely on provided input parameters without external data flows that could introduce security issues.",
