  "purpose": "Singleton class managing a registry of class definitions stored as strings.",
  "sources": "Method parameters in add_class (name, class_def)",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or output",
  "flows": "Input parameters (name, class_def) passed to add_class, stored in internal dictionary",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, no obfuscation, no external data handling",
  "analysis": "The code implements a singleton pattern with methods to add, check, retrieve, and clear class definitions stored as strings. It does not process external data sources, execute code dynamically, or perform network operations. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The class definitions are stored as strings, which could be risky if sourced from untrusted inputs elsewhere, but within this code, no such behavior is evident. The implementation is standard and correct, with no logical flaws or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign singleton registry utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The assessments and scores indicating zero malware, no obfuscation, and negligible security risk are accurate and appropriate.",
