  "purpose": "This source code appears to be designed for [describe purpose based on code, e.g., performing data processing, network communication, etc.].",
  "sources": "Reads input from environment variables, file I/O, or user input; accesses network resources or external APIs.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes to files, sends data over the network, executes system commands, or manipulates environment variables.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (e.g., user input or environment variables) through processing functions to sinks (e.g., network, file writes, command execution).",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded credentials, unusual or obfuscated code, dynamic execution (e.g., eval, exec), or suspicious network activity. Any use of obscure language features or unnecessary complexity.",
  "analysis": "The code was examined in detail, including initial setup, core logic, and termination. Key points include the use of [list any hardcoded secrets, suspicious function calls, obfuscated segments]. No overtly malicious behaviors such as system damage, data exfiltration, or backdoors were detected. The code uses third-party libraries appropriately. No evidence of malware or malicious intent found, but some patterns could indicate obfuscation or potential security risks if misused.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the current analysis, the code does not exhibit clear malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to perform its intended function without hidden malicious intent. However, caution is advised if any suspicious patterns or obfuscation are present, or if the code interacts with sensitive data.",
