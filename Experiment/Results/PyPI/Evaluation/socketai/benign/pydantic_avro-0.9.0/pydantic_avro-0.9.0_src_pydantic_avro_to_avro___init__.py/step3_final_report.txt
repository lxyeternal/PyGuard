  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Input reading points such as environment variables, files, user input, network requests, eval/exec functions.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file writes, subprocess calls, potential data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks via data processing, dynamic code execution, or network requests.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation patterns, suspicious network activity, dynamic execution, unvalidated inputs.",
  "analysis": "The code shows no evidence of malicious activity. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are detected. Dynamic execution functions are flagged as potential risks but are not confirmed malicious. Absence of obfuscation and malicious signatures results in low malware and obfuscation scores. Minor security concerns are noted due to potential for hidden behaviors, but no concrete evidence is present. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with a cautious approach reflected in the low security risk score.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency code appears benign with no detected malicious or obfuscated behavior. Scores are appropriately low, reflecting minor potential concerns without evidence. No adjustments are necessary.",
