  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Report 1**\n   - **Issue presence:** The code is a simple import statement with no additional logic.\n   - **Errors/flaws:** None identified; the reasoning is sound.\n   - **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, which are appropriate.\n   - **Risk justification:** The code is benign; no security risk.\n   - **Overall:** Correct assessment.\n\n2. **Report 2**\n   - **Issue presence:** Same as above; a straightforward import.\n   - **Errors/flaws:** None.\n   - **Scores:** Appropriately set to zero for malware and obfuscation.\n   - **Risk justification:** No malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n   - **Overall:** Correct.\n\n3. **Report 3**\n   - **Issue presence:** Again, a simple import statement.\n   - **Errors/flaws:** No issues.\n   - **Scores:** Correctly zeroed.\n   - **Risk justification:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n   - **Overall:** Correct.\n\n4. **Report 4**\n   - **Issue presence:** Import statement only.\n   - **Errors/flaws:** None.\n   - **Scores:** Appropriately zero.\n   - **Risk justification:** No malicious activity.\n   - **Overall:** Correct.\n\n5. **Report 5**\n   - **Issue presence:** Same as others; just an import.\n   - **Errors/flaws:** None.\n   - **Scores:** Correct.\n   - **Risk justification:** No security concerns.\n   - **Overall:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- All reports describe benign, minimal import statements.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, security risk) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0, no security risk identified.\n\n**Note:** Given the simplicity of the code, even considering potential future changes, the current scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe code snippets are standard import statements used for backwards compatibility. They pose no security threat, contain no malware, and are not obfuscated. The assigned scores are reasonable and should remain at zero for malware and obfuscation, with a security risk score of zero.",
