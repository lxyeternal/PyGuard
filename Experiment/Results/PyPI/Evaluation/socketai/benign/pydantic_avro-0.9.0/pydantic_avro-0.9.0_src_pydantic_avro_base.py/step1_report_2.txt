  "purpose": "Importing the AvroBase class from the pydantic_avro library for use in serialization/deserialization tasks.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a third-party library (pydantic_avro).",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process data at runtime.",
  "flows": "No data flow beyond the import statement.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; the comment indicates a backwards compatibility purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a single import statement with a comment about backwards compatibility. It imports a class from a known library (pydantic_avro). There are no functions, data processing, or dynamic code execution. The import is standard and does not exhibit any signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The comment clarifies intent but does not impact security analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement intended for backwards compatibility. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
