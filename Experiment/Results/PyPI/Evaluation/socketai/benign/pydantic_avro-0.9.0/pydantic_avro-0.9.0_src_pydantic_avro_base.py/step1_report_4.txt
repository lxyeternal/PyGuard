{
  "purpose": "Importing a base class from the pydantic_avro library for data serialization/deserialization.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; just a static import statement.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no processing or data output occurs in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only a single import statement without further code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import statement with no suspicious patterns or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific class from an external library to presumably facilitate backward compatibility. The import appears standard and does not involve dynamic execution, code injection, or any suspicious behavior. The library 'pydantic_avro' is an open-source package, and this import statement alone does not pose security risks. There are no hardcoded credentials, no network calls, and no evidence of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple import statement for a base class to ensure backward compatibility. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks within this minimal code fragment.",
