  "purpose": "Define a variable based on the version of the pydantic library to determine schema definitions naming conventions.",
  "sources": "Imports VERSION from the pydantic library",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output",
  "flows": "Uses the imported version string to set a boolean flag and then conditionally defines a string variable",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward version check and variable assignment",
  "analysis": "The code imports the VERSION attribute from pydantic, then checks if the version starts with '2.' to set a boolean flag. Based on this flag, it assigns a string to DEFS_NAME. The code performs a simple, direct version check without any external input, dynamic code execution, or hidden behaviors. No hardcoded credentials, data leakage, or suspicious operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version check and variable assignment with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be standard configuration code for handling different pydantic versions.",
