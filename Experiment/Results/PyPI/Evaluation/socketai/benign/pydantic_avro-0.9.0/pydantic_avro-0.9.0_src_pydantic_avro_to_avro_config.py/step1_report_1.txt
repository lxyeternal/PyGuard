  "purpose": "Determine the version of the pydantic library and set a variable based on whether it is version 2.x or not.",
  "sources": "Importing VERSION attribute from pydantic, reading the version string.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no data output, network transmission, or file operations.",
  "flows": "The version string is read and then used to set a boolean flag, with no further data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. The code is straightforward and version-dependent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the VERSION attribute from the pydantic package, checks if it starts with '2.', and then sets a variable accordingly. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no sensitive data handling, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious logic or side effects. The code appears to be a simple version check for conditional logic based on the pydantic version.\n\nNo malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks are detected. The code is clean, simple, and intended for compatibility or configuration purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a benign version check of the pydantic library, setting a variable based on whether the version is 2.x. It does not contain malicious behavior or security issues.",
