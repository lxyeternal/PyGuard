  "purpose": "Define a version check for pydantic and set a definitions name based on the version.",
  "sources": "Importing VERSION from pydantic module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "Source (PYDANTIC_VERSION) influences the value of PYDANTIC_V2 and DEFS_NAME.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward version checking and variable assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the VERSION attribute from the pydantic library and sets a boolean flag (PYDANTIC_V2) based on whether the version starts with '2.'. It then assigns a string value to DEFS_NAME based on this flag. This is a simple version check and variable assignment, with no untrusted data handling, external calls, or dynamic code execution. The code appears to serve configuration purposes based on library version.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard version check and conditional assignment without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain obfuscation or suspicious behaviors. The code is safe.",
