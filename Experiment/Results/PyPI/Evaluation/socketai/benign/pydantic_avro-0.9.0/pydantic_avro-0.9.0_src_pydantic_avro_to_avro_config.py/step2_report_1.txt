  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the original code.\n\n**1. Report 1**  \n- **Summary:** Confirms the code performs a benign version check, no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, no security issues.  \n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The code is straightforward, importing `VERSION`, checking if it starts with `'2.'`, and setting a variable accordingly. No suspicious activity or vulnerabilities are present.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, SecurityRisk: 0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Fully aligned with the code.\n\n**2. Report 2**  \n- **Summary:** Same as above; straightforward version check, no anomalies or malicious intent.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct. The logic is simple and safe.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, SecurityRisk: 0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Consistent.\n\n**3. Report 3**  \n- **Summary:** Simple version check, no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct. No hidden or malicious code.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, SecurityRisk: 0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**4. Report 4**  \n- **Summary:** Straightforward version check and variable assignment, no anomalies.  \n- **Assessment:** Accurate.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, SecurityRisk: 0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**5. Report 5**  \n- **Summary:** Basic version-dependent configuration logic, no malicious activity.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, SecurityRisk: 0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Presence:** The code is simple, directly importing a version string and setting a variable based on whether the version starts with `'2.'`.  \n- **Malicious Behavior:** None detected; no obfuscated code, no suspicious data flow, no external or untrusted data handling.  \n- **Obfuscation:** None; the code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Security Risks:** None; the logic is benign, serving a configuration purpose.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at **0**.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at **0**.  \n- **Risk Score:** Should be **0**. The code is a simple version check with no security implications.\n\n### Summary:\n\nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the reports' conclusions.",
