  "purpose": "Determine if the code performs a benign version check or contains malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Importing VERSION from pydantic, reading the version string.",
  "sinks": "None; no data leaks, external inputs, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Import of VERSION -> check if starts with '2.' -> set boolean flag -> assign DEFS_NAME based on flag.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version check, no obfuscation, no suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the VERSION attribute from pydantic, checks if it starts with '2.', and sets a variable accordingly. It is a simple, static configuration snippet with no external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security vulnerabilities are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the code's purpose. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward version check with no malicious or suspicious behavior. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.",
