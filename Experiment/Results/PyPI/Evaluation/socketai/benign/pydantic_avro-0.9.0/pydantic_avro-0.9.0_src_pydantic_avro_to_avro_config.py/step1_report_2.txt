  "purpose": "Determine the version of the pydantic library and set a variable based on whether it is version 2.x or not.",
  "sources": "Importing VERSION from pydantic module to check the library version.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Reading the imported VERSION to determine library version, then setting a string variable accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the VERSION attribute from the pydantic library, checks if it starts with '2.' to identify if pydantic version 2.x is used, and then sets the DEFS_NAME variable accordingly. This is a simple version check and string assignment, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscated code. No external input, data leaks, or potentially dangerous operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a straightforward version check of the pydantic library and sets a variable based on that check. There is no malicious behavior, no security risks, and no obfuscation detected.",
