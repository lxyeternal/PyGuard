  "purpose": "Determine the version of the pydantic library and set a configuration parameter based on it.",
  "sources": "Importing VERSION from the pydantic package",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; only variable assignments based on imported version information",
  "flows": "Imported VERSION influences the boolean PYDANTIC_V2, which determines the value of DEFS_NAME",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward version check and variable assignment",
  "analysis": "The code imports the VERSION attribute from the pydantic package, then checks if it starts with '2.' to determine if pydantic version 2.x is used. Based on this, it sets the DEFS_NAME variable accordingly. The logic is simple, with no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious patterns. The purpose appears to be configuration handling based on library version.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a basic version check and conditional assignment without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is a standard pattern for handling version-dependent logic.",
