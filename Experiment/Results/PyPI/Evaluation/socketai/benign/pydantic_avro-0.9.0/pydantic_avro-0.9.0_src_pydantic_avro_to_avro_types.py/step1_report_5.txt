  "purpose": "The code converts Pydantic schema definitions into AVRO schema representations, supporting nested structures, references, and various data types.",
  "sources": "Reads schema definitions, property attributes, references ($ref), default values, descriptions, and type annotations from input schema dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "Generates AVRO schema dicts which may be used in serialization/deserialization processes, but no direct sinks such as network or file I/O are present.",
  "flows": "Schema input -> type determination and processing functions -> AVRO schema dicts; no execution of untrusted data or external commands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. Use of standard schema processing logic without obfuscation. No dynamic code execution or external calls detected.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically processes schema definitions, references, and types to produce AVRO schemas. It uses standard data structures, handles references carefully with a set to prevent reprocessing, and converts various data types correctly. No code injection, network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. All functions perform data transformation within the local context, strictly schema-related. No suspicious or malicious logic such as file or network operations, backdoors, or privacy violations identified.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a benign schema converter from Pydantic to AVRO, with no evidence of malicious intent, malicious behaviors, or security risks. It strictly performs data structure transformations without external or covert actions.",
