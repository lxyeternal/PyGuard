{
  "purpose": "Converts Pydantic schemas to AVRO schemas, handling nested structures, references, unions, arrays, tuples, and primitive types.",
  "sources": "Schema property definitions, references ($ref), and type annotations within the schema dict.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; internal data structures are processed without external I/O or network calls.",
  "flows": "Schema properties flow into AVRO type definitions via internal methods, resolving references and handling various data types.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors detected. No dynamic code execution or external data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code performs deterministic schema transformations, resolving references, handling nested types, and generating AVRO definitions. It does not perform any network I/O, file operations, or execute untrusted code. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The handling of references and schema definitions is standard and safe. The slight security risk score in some reports reflects schema complexity but does not indicate actual vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured schema conversion utility with no malicious or security concerns. All reports' assessments are accurate and consistent. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and overall security risk is negligible (approximately 0). No modifications to the scores are necessary.",
