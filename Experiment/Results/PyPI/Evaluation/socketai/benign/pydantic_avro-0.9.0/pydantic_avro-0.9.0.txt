The main concern lies with Report 2, which exhibits patterns typical of obfuscated or potentially malicious code, warranting a slightly higher malware score (0.45). Overall, the codebase appears predominantly benign with isolated moderate concerns. Minor adjustments, such as increasing Report 2's malware score to 0.5 if eval/exec are confirmed malicious, could be considered, but current scores are appropriate."
