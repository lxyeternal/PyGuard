{
  "purpose": "To dynamically load and set up the ScreenTime framework, including registering unavailable methods and modifying global namespace.",
  "sources": "import sys, Foundation, objc, and local _metadata; calls to objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr; framework path /System/Library/Frameworks/ScreenTime.framework",
  "sinks": "globals() modification (pop), dynamic method registration via objc.registerUnavailableMethod",
  "flows": "Import modules -> create framework dir and get attributes -> set __dir__ and __getattr__ -> register methods as unavailable -> delete _metadata from sys.modules",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic creation of framework interface, removal of _metadata from sys.modules, registration of methods as unavailable (which could disable functionality), no explicit use of user input or network activity",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up a framework interface dynamically by importing system and framework modules, then creates a framework directory and attribute getter functions. It registers certain methods as unavailable, potentially to prevent their use or to disable features. It then removes _metadata from sys.modules, possibly to prevent further access or modifications. The overall pattern is typical for wrapping system frameworks and does not contain malicious activity. No suspicious code injection, data leaks, or external communications are present. The code's purpose appears to be legitimate framework setup, with some dynamic method handling that is common in bridging Objective-C frameworks.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs dynamic framework setup and method registration without any indication of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It appears to be a standard setup for a Python binding to an Apple system framework. No malware or security risks are identified.",
