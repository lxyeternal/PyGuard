{
  "purpose": "This code initializes a Python wrapper for the macOS ScreenTime framework, setting up dynamic attribute access and registering unavailable methods.",
  "sources": "Import statements, the createFrameworkDirAndGetattr function, and framework path retrieval, as well as the registration of unavailable methods.",
  "sinks": "Potential sink could be the dynamic creation of framework attributes and method registration, but these are standard for such bindings.",
  "flows": "Imports -> framework setup via createFrameworkDirAndGetattr -> registration of unavailable methods -> cleanup",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity, no unusual data handling observed. The use of objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr is standard for framework bindings.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function _setup() that imports necessary modules and sets up framework access using objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr, which dynamically creates framework attributes. It registers certain methods as unavailable, likely to prevent their use. It then removes the _setup symbol from globals and invokes it immediately. All operations appear to be standard for wrapping an Apple framework in Python, with no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or sabotage. No suspicious code paths, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for interfacing with the ScreenTime framework in Python, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It functions solely to facilitate framework access and method management.",
