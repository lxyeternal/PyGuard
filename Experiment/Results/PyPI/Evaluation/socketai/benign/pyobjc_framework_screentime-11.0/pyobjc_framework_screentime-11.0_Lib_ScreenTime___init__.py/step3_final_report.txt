  "purpose": "This code dynamically loads the macOS ScreenTime framework and sets up Objective-C bridging functions, including registering some methods as unavailable and cleaning up internal modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements, objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr call, method registration via objc.registerUnavailableMethod, deletion of sys.modules['ScreenTime._metadata']",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, network calls, or data leaks are present",
  "flows": "The framework is loaded and configured via createFrameworkDirAndGetattr; methods are registered as unavailable; internal modules are removed from sys.modules",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic framework loading and method registration are standard in Objective-C bridging; no suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or external communication detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Objective-C framework setup in Python, with dynamic attribute creation and method registration. No malicious activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation is evident. The removal of internal modules is unusual but not malicious; likely a cleanup step. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk 0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign, standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup routine for interfacing with the ScreenTime framework. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The scores are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
