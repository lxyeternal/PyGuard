{
  "purpose": "To dynamically load and configure the ScreenTime framework on macOS/iOS, setting up method bindings and registering unavailable methods.",
  "sources": "Import statements, objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr call, sys.modules manipulation, method registration functions.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data; no network, file, or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Import sys & modules -> create framework directory & getattr functions -> assign to globals -> register unavailable methods -> cleanup sys.modules.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic creation of framework bindings and removal of internal module from sys.modules; no docstrings or comments explaining the purpose of method registration or framework setup; no apparent malicious logic or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs dynamic framework loading via objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr, registers unavailable methods for certain classes, and cleans up the module list. No data is read from external sources beyond framework loading. No network activity, no data exfiltration, or code that manipulates or exploits system resources in suspicious ways. The removal of the internal '_metadata' module after framework setup could be a cleanup step, but does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code is a standard setup routine for Objective-C bridging and framework configuration, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign framework setup and initialization code for interfacing with Apple's ScreenTime framework. There are no indications of malicious intent, data leakage, or malicious payloads. The only unusual aspect is the dynamic method registration and cleanup, which are typical in such bridging code but do not suggest malicious activity.",
