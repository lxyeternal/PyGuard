{
  "purpose": "This code is a Python setup script for packaging the 'pyobjc-framework-ScreenTime' module, facilitating installation and distribution of the wrapper for the macOS ScreenTime framework.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the environment during package installation, such as environment variables and system paths, indirectly via the setup process.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; it does not perform data leaks, network communication, or external data handling.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing modules, setting the system path, and invoking the setup function with static metadata; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, modifies sys.path, and calls a setup function with fixed parameters. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or external data handling. The code's purpose is solely to configure package metadata for distribution. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. All signals indicate benign, standard packaging code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately set to 0, with high confidence. The analysis confirms that the code poses no threat and is safe for use.",
