{
  "purpose": "This script sets up a Python package wrapper for the macOS ScreenTime framework using PyObjC, facilitating integration with macOS system APIs.",
  "sources": "Reads the current file's directory (os.path.dirname(__file__)), environment variables (via sys.path), and the module's own docstring (__doc__).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; no untrusted data is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "The code imports system path modifications, uses the setup function from pyobjc_setup, and passes package configuration data; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; the code is straightforward and adheres to standard setup script conventions.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily configures and initiates the setup for a Python package. It modifies sys.path for local module access, imports a setup function, and calls it with package metadata. There are no dynamic code executions, network communications, credential handling, or other suspicious activities. The code appears to be a legitimate setup script for a PyObjC wrapper package, with no indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard package setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It performs typical package configuration tasks without processing untrusted input or performing any harmful actions.",
