{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package that provides wrappers for the macOS ScreenTime framework using PyObjC.",
  "sources": "Reading the script file itself, importing 'os', 'sys', and 'pyobjc_setup', and reading the __doc__ string.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data output, network operations, or external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from sources to sinks; the script primarily defines package metadata and modifies the sys.path.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed. The script is a standard setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script imports system modules, adjusts sys.path, and configures package setup parameters such as name, description, version, dependencies, and long description. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or execute code that could be malicious. The code appears to be a typical setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard Python package setup script for wrapping the ScreenTime framework on macOS. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this code. It is a benign package configuration script.",
