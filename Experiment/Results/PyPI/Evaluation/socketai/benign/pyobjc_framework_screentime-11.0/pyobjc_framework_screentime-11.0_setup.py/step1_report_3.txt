  "purpose": "Setup script for the pyobjc framework wrapping macOS's ScreenTime API, intended for package installation.",
  "sources": "Import statements (os, sys, pyobjc_setup), and configuration variables like VERSION.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data processing or external data sinks are observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; setup configuration is static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code performs standard package setup without suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward setup configuration for a Python package, importing necessary modules, defining package metadata, and calling setup() with specified parameters. It does not include any network activity, data collection, or runtime behavior beyond standard package installation procedures. There are no hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or external data handling that could indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply prepares the package for distribution and installation.",
