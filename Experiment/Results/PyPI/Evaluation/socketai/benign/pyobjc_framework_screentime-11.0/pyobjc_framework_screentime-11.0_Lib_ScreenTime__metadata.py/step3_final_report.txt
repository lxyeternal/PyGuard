  "purpose": "Metadata registration for Objective-C classes and selectors related to system restrictions and web content controls, used for runtime configuration and introspection.",
  "sources": "System architecture checks (sys.maxsize, objc.arch), static strings, registration functions (objc.registerMetaDataForSelector, objc.registerNewKeywordsFromSelector).",
  "sinks": "Objective-C runtime registration functions that modify class and selector metadata.",
  "flows": "Conditional function definitions based on system properties, followed by registration calls to set up class metadata and selectors.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; code is straightforward and standard for runtime setup.",
  "analysis": "The code performs Objective-C runtime metadata registration for classes related to screen time and web history. It uses system properties to define helper functions and registers metadata for specific selectors. There is no external data input, network activity, or data leakage. The functions and patterns used are typical for system or SDK configuration. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk ~0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate Objective-C runtime setup code with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The reports' assessments are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
