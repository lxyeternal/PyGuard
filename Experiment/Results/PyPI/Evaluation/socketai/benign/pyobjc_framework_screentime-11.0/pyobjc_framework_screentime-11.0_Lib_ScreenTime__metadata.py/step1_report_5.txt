{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up metadata for Objective-C classes and selectors, possibly for introspection or dynamic method handling within an application, likely related to screen time and web content management.",
  "sources": "Reads class and selector names, system architecture info, and module imports; registers metadata for specific Objective-C selectors.",
  "sinks": "Calls to objc.registerMetaDataForSelector and objc.registerNewKeywordsFromSelector, which could influence runtime behavior but do not inherently process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Imports system info and Objective-C classes → registers metadata and keywords for specific selectors → does not process external input or user data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. Usage of reflection and metadata registration appears standard for Objective-C runtime modifications; no obfuscated or malicious code patterns identified.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily interacts with Objective-C runtime functions to register method metadata and keywords for classes related to screen time and web management. It uses conditional logic based on system architecture and architecture-specific functions. There is no evidence of data leakage, code injection, or malicious payloads. The code does not process external input, nor does it invoke system commands or network operations. Its structure suggests legitimate runtime configuration rather than malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard Objective-C runtime setup code for metadata registration related to certain classes and selectors. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security threats are evident. It does not handle untrusted data nor perform any suspicious operations.",
