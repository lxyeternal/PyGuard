{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be configuring metadata and method registrations for Objective-C classes related to screen time and web history management, likely for system or application-level monitoring or restrictions.",
  "sources": "The code reads system properties (sys.maxsize, objc.arch) and interacts with the Objective-C runtime via objc.registerMetaDataForSelector and objc.registerNewKeywordsFromSelector.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the registration of metadata and keywords that could influence system behavior or restrict web content, but no direct data leaks or malicious actions are evident.",
  "flows": "System properties determine conditional function selection; metadata registration functions serve as configuration points; no untrusted data flows are apparent.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code is mainly configuration-oriented and does not perform any malicious actions or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code configures Objective-C method metadata for classes related to screen time and web history, likely for system or app restrictions. It reads system architecture and runtime info to define conditional functions. Metadata registration calls set up behavior for selectors, possibly to modify or observe system classes. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious data handling are present. The code is structured and follows standard patterns for Objective-C runtime metadata configuration. There are no indications of obfuscation or malware.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate configuration script for Objective-C runtime metadata, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It primarily sets up class and method metadata for system restrictions or monitoring.",
