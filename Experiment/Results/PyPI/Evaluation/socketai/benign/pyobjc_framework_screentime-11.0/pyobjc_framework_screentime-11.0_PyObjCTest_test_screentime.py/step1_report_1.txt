  "sources": "Import statements for PyObjCTools.TestSupport and ScreenTime modules.",
  "sinks": "The test method asserts callable metadata; no direct sinks for untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "Importing modules -> executing test method -> asserting callable metadata sanity.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns. The code is a standard unit test.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a testing support library and the ScreenTime module, then defines a test case that checks the 'callable metadata' of ScreenTime. There are no dynamic code executions, no network activity, no hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors. The test appears to be a legitimate unit test for module verification. No anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign unit test with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
