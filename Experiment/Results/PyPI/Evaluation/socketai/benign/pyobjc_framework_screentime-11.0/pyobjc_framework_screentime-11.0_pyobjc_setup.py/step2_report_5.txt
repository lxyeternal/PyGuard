  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The script manages build, test, and environment setup, reading system info, environment variables, and package metadata.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Executes system commands (`sw_vers`, `clang`, `xcrun`), reads plist files, modifies `sys.path`, and loads modules.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no malicious network activity. Uses standard system info commands, environment manipulation, and module loading typical for build scripts.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate build script, no malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (low, due to environment manipulation, but typical)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 (high certainty of benign purpose)\n\n**Verdict:** The scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1—build configuration, system info, SDK detection.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uses subprocess to get system info, modifies `sys.path`, loads modules.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious activity. Uses subprocess for system info, which is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate build script, no malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.2\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Build and test setup, environment detection.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Similar subprocess calls, environment variable usage, module imports.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious activity. Subprocesses are used for system info, typical in build scripts.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, standard setup script.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.2\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Build and test configuration, environment info, SDK detection.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uses subprocesses for system info, modifies `sys.path`, loads test modules.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious activity. Use of subprocess for info gathering is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Typical build/test script, no malicious signs.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.2\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Build and test configuration, environment setup.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Similar subprocess calls, environment variable reading, module loading.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious activity. Uses subprocesses for system info, typical in build scripts.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate build/test script.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.2\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All are 0, as code is clear.\n- **Risk scores:** 0.2 is consistent, considering environment manipulation and subprocess calls are typical but could pose minor risks if environment variables are maliciously manipulated.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 is justified given the analysis.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The scores across all reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage are evident.\n- The use of subprocess and environment variables, while potentially risky if manipulated, is standard for build scripts and does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (acknowledging environment manipulation potential but typical in build scripts)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' evaluations and the nature of the code.",
