{
  "purpose": "The code manages build, test, and environment setup for the PyObjC framework, including system info collection, SDK detection, and test execution.",
  "sources": "System commands ('sw_vers', 'clang', 'xcrun'), environment variables, SDK plist files, filesystem reads, and module imports.",
  "sinks": "Execution of system commands, reading and writing files, modifying sys.path, and dynamic module loading.",
  "flows": "System info collection via subprocess, environment setup, SDK detection, module importation, and test suite execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no network activity or payloads. Use of subprocesses and environment variables is standard for build scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script performs environment detection, SDK version retrieval, and test management using subprocess calls and filesystem reads, all typical in build environments. No malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or sabotage is evident. The subprocess calls and environment manipulations are standard practices and do not indicate malicious intent. The code is clear, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or secrets.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate build and test setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The scores—malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0.2—are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
