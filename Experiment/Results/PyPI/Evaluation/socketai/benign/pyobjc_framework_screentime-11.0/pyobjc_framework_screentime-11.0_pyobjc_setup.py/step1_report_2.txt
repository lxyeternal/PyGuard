{
  "purpose": "This code provides setup and build configuration for the PyObjC framework, including custom build commands, environment setup, and test suite management.",
  "sources": "System commands (`subprocess.check_output`), environment variables (`os.environ`), file system operations (`os.path`, `os.listdir`, open files), and package metadata.",
  "sinks": "Execution of system commands, reading system info, writing build info files, and importing test modules.",
  "flows": "Code reads system and environment data (system version, SDK info), processes build configurations, and imports test modules based on filesystem patterns.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors detected. Use of subprocess calls to system commands could potentially be misused if environment is manipulated externally, but no malicious intent evident. No obfuscated or unusual language features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles build and testing procedures for a Python package, with functions to determine system SDK versions, compile flags, and manage test suites. It uses subprocesses to query system info and SDK details, and modifies sys.path for testing. No suspicious network activity, credential handling, or malicious code inclusion was found. The subprocess calls are standard for system info retrieval and do not indicate malicious intent. No backdoors or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code adheres to expected build system practices, with no anomalies suggesting sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup script for building and testing the PyObjC package. It performs system queries, manages build configurations, and runs tests without any malicious behavior or sabotage detected.",
