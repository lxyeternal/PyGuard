{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for building, testing, and installing the PyObjC framework wrappers, including custom build commands, environment setup, and test suite management.",
  "sources": "Reads system environment variables (e.g., CFLAGS, PATH), executes subprocess commands (e.g., sw_vers, clang, xcrun), reads files from filesystem (e.g., SDKSettings.plist, header files), imports modules, and reads package metadata.",
  "sinks": "Executes subprocesses for system information and compiler checks, opens and reads plist and header files, modifies sys.path, writes build info files, and loads test modules dynamically.",
  "flows": "System environment variables (CFLAGS, PATH) -> subprocess calls (sw_vers, clang, xcrun) -> file operations (SDKSettings.plist, header files) -> module imports for testing, runtime modifications to sys.path and environment variables.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets detected. The code dynamically executes system commands and loads modules, which could potentially be exploited if environment variables are maliciously manipulated. No obfuscated code present. The code handles build and test environments but does not perform suspicious data exfiltration or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages build, environment setup, and testing for the PyObjC framework. It includes subprocess calls to retrieve system information and SDK details, dynamically modifies sys.path, and loads test modules. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or hidden backdoors. It relies on standard build tools and environment checks. No malicious or sabotage indicators were found. The code does perform system information collection and environment manipulation but these are typical for setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup and testing script for a Python framework, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It performs environment and system checks, module loading, and build configuration, all consistent with legitimate build tooling.",
