  "purpose": "Unit test for the ScreenTime module, specifically checking a boolean property enforcement method.",
  "sources": "Import statements from PyObjCTools.TestSupport and ScreenTime modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code only performs a test assertion without processing untrusted input or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is a straightforward test case.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed. The code uses standard testing practices.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing utilities and the ScreenTime module, then defines a test class with a single method that asserts a boolean property on the ScreenTime object. It performs a basic unit test to verify a property value. There are no indications of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. The code appears to be a legitimate test case with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple unit test that verifies a property in the ScreenTime module. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code is straightforward and appears safe.",
