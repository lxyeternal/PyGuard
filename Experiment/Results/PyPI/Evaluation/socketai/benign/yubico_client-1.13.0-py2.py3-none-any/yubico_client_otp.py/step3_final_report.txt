  "purpose": "Utility class for interpreting and handling Yubico OTP tokens, including optional translation of OTPs from modhex encoding.",
  "sources": "Input OTP string provided to the constructor; the 'translate' function used within get_otp_modehex_interpretation.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; code does not perform data output, network transmission, or file operations.",
  "flows": "Input OTP -> (optional translation via translate()) -> interpretation -> stored in self.otp -> device_id derived from first 12 characters.",
  "anomalies": "Broad exception handling that masks errors; no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets; no obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward OTP utility class that interprets Yubico OTPs, with optional translation. It handles errors broadly, which could mask issues but does not introduce malicious behavior. No network, file, or secret data handling is present. The external 'translate' function's implementation is unknown, but based on context, it is a benign utility. No signs of sabotage, backdoors, or malicious code are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign OTP processing utility with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The current scores are appropriate and do not require adjustment.",
