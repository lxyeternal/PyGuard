  "purpose": "Utility functions for translating Yubikey OTP characters among various alphabet encodings, accommodating multiple Unicode character sets for interpretation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input OTP strings for translation; no external data sources or inputs beyond function parameters.",
  "sinks": "The translation process outputs interpreted OTP strings; no data leaks or external effects occur.",
  "flows": "Input OTP string -> set intersection of possible character sets -> translation to target alphabet -> output interpreted string.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior; extensive Unicode alphabet strings are used solely for character interpretation, not obfuscation or malicious purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines extensive Unicode character sets for OTP interpretation, performs set intersections to determine possible interpretations, and translates OTP strings accordingly. It contains no network activity, file I/O, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. The logic is straightforward and purpose-specific. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or vulnerabilities are present. The extensive Unicode alphabets are for accommodating various keyboard layouts or encodings, not malicious obfuscation. The code's structure and data are transparent, and the functions perform standard string and set operations. The input handling includes version-specific type checks, but no unsafe operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, purpose-specific utility for interpreting Yubikey OTP characters. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in all reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
