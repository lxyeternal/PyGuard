{
  "purpose": "This code defines the metadata and import statements for a Python client used to verify Yubico OTPs.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own module metadata, such as the __all__ and __version__ variables, and imports the Yubico class from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not handle input, output, or external data directly.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code primarily sets up module exports and imports.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual constructs. The import statement is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of metadata comments, module export definitions, versioning, and a single import statement. No functions, data processing, or external network operations are present. It appears to be a standard setup file for a Python package, with no suspicious or malicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical module header and import setup for a Python package related to Yubico OTP verification. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
