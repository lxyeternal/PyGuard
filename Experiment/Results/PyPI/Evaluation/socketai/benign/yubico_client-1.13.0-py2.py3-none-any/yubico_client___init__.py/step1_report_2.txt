  "purpose": "Defines metadata and imports for the Yubico Python Client used for verifying Yubico OTPs.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; metadata and module import statements.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code only defines constants and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code contains module-level docstrings, metadata, and an import statement. It imports a class from a potentially external module 'yubico_client.yubico'. The code appears to be part of a larger, well-structured package for OTP verification. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscated code are present. The import line suggests dependency on an external library, which is standard in such implementations.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a standard module header with import statements for a Yubico OTP verification client. There is no malicious intent or suspicious activity detected within this fragment.",
