{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to serve as a Python client for verifying Yubico OTPs.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'Yubico' class from the 'yubico_client.yubico' module.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform network operations directly.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only sets up module metadata and imports a class.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious or unusual logic, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs. The only import is a class that likely handles verification logic.",
  "analysis": "This is a minimal module that defines metadata and imports a class. It does not perform any data handling, network communication, or contain any executable code beyond the import. No potential security issues are present. The import statement appears standard for modular code organization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module header with an import statement for verification logic. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks.",
