  "purpose": "Module setup and metadata for Yubico OTP verification library, including import of the Yubico class.",
  "sources": "Metadata comments, __all__, __version__, and import statement from local module 'yubico_client.yubico'.",
  "sinks": "No data input/output, network activity, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Import statement imports 'Yubico' class; no data flow or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward metadata and import with no suspicious or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal module header with versioning and import, typical for package initialization. No functions, data processing, or network activity. The import is from a local module, standard for package structure. No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious payloads detected. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module setup with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned are justified and accurate.",
