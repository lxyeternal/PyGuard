  "purpose": "Define compatibility layer for Python 2.x and 3.x in the Libcloud project, ensuring proper imports and functions depending on the Python version.",
  "sources": "Reads Python version information from sys.version_info; imports from urllib or urllib.parse based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "None present; code only handles version detection and conditional imports.",
  "flows": "Reads version info -> determines import path -> imports modules or defines functions accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual behavior; straightforward compatibility handling. No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment detection via sys.version_info and sets up import statements accordingly for compatibility between Python 2 and 3. It defines some functions and variables (u, b) based on the version. No external data inputs or sensitive data handling is involved. The code follows standard compatibility practices and licenses. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard compatibility layer for Python versions, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It functions to facilitate cross-version compatibility for the Libcloud project.",
