  "purpose": "Define Python version compatibility and import appropriate modules for URL encoding and decoding, as well as setting up some version-related flags.",
  "sources": "Reads sys.version_info for Python version detection.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data handling or external data sources.",
  "flows": "Version info detection flows into conditional imports and variable definitions, but no data flow to potentially dangerous functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard compatibility code, license notices, and straightforward version checks.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles Python version detection and sets up imports for compatibility between Python 2 and 3. It imports standard library modules based on version info and defines some utility functions (like b) for byte conversion. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious behaviors, or malicious code patterns are present. The licensing comments indicate open-source licensing, with no obfuscated or unusual constructs. The code is typical for cross-version compatibility layers and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python compatibility layer for handling different Python versions. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
