  "purpose": "Compatibility layer for supporting multiple Python versions, handling version detection, module imports, and utility functions for string and URL processing.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info for Python version detection",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources",
  "flows": "Version info checks to conditional imports and function definitions",
  "anomalies": "Redundant and overlapping version checks (e.g., PY3 initialized twice, overlapping conditions for PY25, PY27, PY32), but these are benign and typical in compatibility code",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward compatibility utility that detects Python version and imports appropriate modules, defining utility functions for string encoding and URL handling. No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code is present. The logic is standard, with some redundant checks that do not impact security. No external data, network activity, or secrets are involved. The code aligns with common practices for cross-version support and licenses are open-source. No anomalies or malicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard compatibility layer with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores should be malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, consistent with the analysis.",
