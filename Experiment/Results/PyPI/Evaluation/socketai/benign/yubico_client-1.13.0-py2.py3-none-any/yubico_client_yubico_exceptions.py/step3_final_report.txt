  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a Yubico OTP validation system.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs, network calls, or data processing; class definitions are static.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external interactions.",
  "flows": "N/A; classes are used for exception raising and catching within a larger system.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward class definitions with no suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions for handling specific errors related to Yubico OTP validation. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or data manipulations. The classes are simple, with attributes and string representations, serving purely as error indicators. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is structural and error-handling related, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely structural, and poses no security threat. The exception classes are standard, with no malicious or suspicious features. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
