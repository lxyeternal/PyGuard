  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to Yubico OTP validation processes.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading occurs in this code; it only defines classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external effects are present in this code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely defines exception classes and their string representations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The code appears straightforward and intended for error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, with constructors setting attributes and __str__ methods returning string messages. No input validation, data handling, or external network interactions are present. There is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks, and no suspicious logic is implemented. The structure and content are consistent with standard error class definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for a Yubico client library. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. It is purely for error handling and messaging.",
