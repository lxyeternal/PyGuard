{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to Yubico OTP verification.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes and does not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data sinks or output channels used in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks as no input processing or external data handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code consists of standard exception class definitions with straightforward string representations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple set of custom exception classes for a Yubico OTP verification client. It contains no external data input, network communication, or data processing logic. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious behavior is present. The classes are standard, well-structured, and serve error handling purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exceptions for error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It functions solely to provide error reporting within a larger codebase.",
