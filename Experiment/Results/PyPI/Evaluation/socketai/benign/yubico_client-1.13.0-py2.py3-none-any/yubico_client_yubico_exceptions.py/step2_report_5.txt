  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code only defines custom exception classes for handling errors related to Yubico OTP validation and signature verification.\n   - No external data processing, network activity, or malicious payloads are present.\n   - The classes are straightforward, with no suspicious or obfuscated constructs.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate: they correctly identify that the code is purely structural, with no malicious behavior.\n   - No logical flaws are evident in the reasoning; the reports correctly interpret the purpose and nature of the code.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - Security risk scores are also 0, aligning with the analysis.\n   - The confidence scores are 1, indicating high certainty that the code is safe.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely defining exception classes with no external interactions or dynamic code execution, higher risk scores are unwarranted.\n   - The reports' scores are justified and reasonable.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score of 0 across all reports is correct.\n   - There is no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are based on straightforward analysis; no assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are made without evidence.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's content and purpose.\n\n**Overall Evaluation:**\n- The code is harmless, standard exception class definitions.\n- No vulnerabilities, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n- The reports are accurate and well-founded.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final notes:**\nThis code is a benign, standard part of a larger OTP validation library, serving solely for error handling. There are no signs of malicious activity or security issues.",
