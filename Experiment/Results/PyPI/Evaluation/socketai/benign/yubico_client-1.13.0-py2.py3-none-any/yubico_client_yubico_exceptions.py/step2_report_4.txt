  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Review Summary:**\n- The code defines several custom exception classes for handling errors in a Yubico OTP validation system.\n- All classes inherit from a base exception class, with straightforward __init__ and __str__ methods.\n- There are no external data inputs, network calls, or data processing.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious constructs, or malicious code are present.\n- The purpose is purely to facilitate error handling in a larger system.\n\n**Assessment of each report:**\n\n1. **Report 1:**  \n   - Purpose: Define custom exceptions.  \n   - Analysis: No anomalies, no external data, no malicious behavior.  \n   - Conclusion: Harmless, standard exception classes.  \n   - Malware score: 0  \n   - Risk score: 0\n\n2. **Report 2:**  \n   - Purpose: Same as above.  \n   - Analysis: Straightforward class definitions, no suspicious code.  \n   - Conclusion: Benign, no malicious intent.  \n   - Malware score: 0  \n   - Risk score: 0\n\n3. **Report 3:**  \n   - Purpose: Same as above.  \n   - Analysis: No external data or network activity, standard class structure.  \n   - Conclusion: No signs of malicious behavior.  \n   - Malware score: 0  \n   - Risk score: 0\n\n4. **Report 4:**  \n   - Purpose: Same as above.  \n   - Analysis: No external data handling or suspicious patterns.  \n   - Conclusion: Benign.  \n   - Malware score: 0  \n   - Risk score: 0\n\n5. **Report 5:**  \n   - Purpose: Same as above.  \n   - Analysis: Standard exception classes, no malicious code.  \n   - Conclusion: No security risk.  \n   - Malware score: 0  \n   - Risk score: 0\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior; scores are 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** Given the code's nature, a score of 0 is justified; no security risks are present.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- The code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions for error handling.\n- There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and accurate.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No changes to the scores are necessary.",
