  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to Yubico OTP validation and signature verification.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading; internal exception handling classes are defined.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external communications are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this code only defines exception classes without data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of exception class definitions with standard inheritance and string representation methods.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes for handling specific errors related to Yubico OTP validation, including status errors, invalid client IDs, validation response issues, and signature verification failures. There are no external inputs, data processing, or network operations. The class implementations are straightforward, with no dynamic code execution or suspicious constructs. The code appears to be standard exception handling classes without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains only harmless exception class definitions with no suspicious or malicious behavior. It does not include any data leaks, network activity, or malicious payloads. The purpose is purely to facilitate error handling in a larger OTP validation system.",
