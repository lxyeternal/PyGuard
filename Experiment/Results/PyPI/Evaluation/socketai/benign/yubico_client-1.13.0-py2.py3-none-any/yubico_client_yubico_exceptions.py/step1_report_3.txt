{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling errors related to Yubico OTP verification.",
  "sources": "None (no input reading or data handling is present).",
  "sinks": "None (no data output, network calls, or untrusted data handling).",
  "flows": "No data flow exists within this code; it only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward class definitions without dynamic code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code contains multiple custom exception classes for error handling, each with straightforward attributes and string representations. There are no input sources, external data handling, or suspicious behaviors such as network operations, data exfiltration, or code injection. The code appears to be a standard exception hierarchy for a Yubico OTP client, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module defining error classes for a Yubico OTP client. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is purely structural, intended for error handling within a larger application.",
