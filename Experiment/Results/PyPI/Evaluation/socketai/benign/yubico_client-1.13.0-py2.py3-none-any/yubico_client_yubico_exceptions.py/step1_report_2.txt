{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various errors related to Yubico OTP validation.",
  "sources": "Exception constructors and string representations; no external data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is written to external systems or used insecurely.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows or untrusted data handling beyond exception messages.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to be straightforward class definitions for exception handling with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions, including initializers and string representations, without any data processing, external data input, or security-sensitive operations. It does not contain hardcoded credentials, network operations, or potentially malicious code. There is no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns. The code serves as part of a larger library for OTP verification error handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign component defining exception classes for a Yubico OTP validation library. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is purely structural and for error management.",
