  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the scores assigned, and the overall security implications.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code defines several custom exception classes for handling errors in a Yubico OTP validation library.\n- The classes include YubicoError (base), StatusCodeError, InvalidClientIdError, InvalidValidationResponse, and SignatureVerificationError.\n- All classes are straightforward, with constructors setting attributes and __str__ methods providing string representations.\n- There are no external data inputs, network operations, or dynamic code execution.\n- The code is purely structural, intended for error handling within a larger system.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  No. The code is standard exception class definitions with no vulnerabilities, malicious code, or anomalies.\n\n### Logical or Reasoning Flaws:\n- **Errors or mistakes?**  \n  No. The implementation is standard and correct for defining custom exceptions.\n\n### Scores and their Reasonableness:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0. The code contains no malicious payloads or suspicious behavior.  \n  **Verdict:** Score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.  \n  **Verdict:** Score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0. Since the code is only defining exception classes, there is no security risk.  \n  **Verdict:** Score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n### Justification for higher scores:\n- No report assigns a score > 0.5, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n### Potential assumptions or vulnerabilities:\n- The reports correctly identify that this code is purely structural with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the code's content and purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate in their evaluation, and the code is harmless.\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusion:\nThis code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions with no security issues. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My personal estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nNo changes needed; the reports are accurate and consistent.",
