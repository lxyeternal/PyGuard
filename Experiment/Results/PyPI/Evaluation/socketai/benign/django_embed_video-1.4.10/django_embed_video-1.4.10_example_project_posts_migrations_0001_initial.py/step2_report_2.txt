  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and assess the scores.\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward Django migration script that creates a 'Post' model with an 'id', 'title', and 'video' field.\n- The 'embed_video.fields.EmbedVideoField' is a third-party package but commonly used for embedding videos.\n- No user input handling, external data processing, or dynamic code execution.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n- The code appears standard, safe, and benign.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Defines a Django migration creating a Post model with a video field.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious code, no malware, no security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 (slightly above zero, perhaps due to third-party package usage).\n\n**Assessment:** The low securityRisk score (0.1) is reasonable; no malware or obfuscation. The confidence is high (0.95). **Scores seem appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to above, creating a Post model with an embedded video.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior or security risks detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The securityRisk is zero, and malware is zero. The confidence is perfect (1). **Scores are appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Standard migration for creating a Post with a video field.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious code, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is safe. **Scores are appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Standard schema migration.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is benign. **Scores seem fine.**\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to others, creating a Post model.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious code, no malware.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 (slightly above zero).\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly elevated securityRisk score (0.1) might be due to third-party package use, but since it's standard and safe, this is acceptable. The confidence is high (0.9).\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, consistent with the straightforward, clear code.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports, justified by the use of a third-party package, but overall very low.\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** 0.05 — very low, mainly due to third-party package, but no actual security concern.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe reports are consistent, and their scores are appropriate given the code. No evidence suggests malicious intent or obfuscation. The slight securityRisk score is justified by the use of a third-party package but does not indicate a real threat.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The code is safe, with no security risks or malware. The scores are reasonable and should remain as they are, or be slightly adjusted to reflect the very low risk level (e.g., 0.05).",
