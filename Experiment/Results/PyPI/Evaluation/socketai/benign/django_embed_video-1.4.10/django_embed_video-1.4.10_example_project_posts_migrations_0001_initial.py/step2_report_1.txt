  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code is a Django migration script that creates a `Post` model with:\n  - An auto-incrementing primary key `id`\n  - A `title` field (CharField)\n  - A `video` field using `embed_video.fields.EmbedVideoField`\n- The code is straightforward, static, and uses standard Django practices.\n- No user input handling, external data processing, or dynamic code execution.\n- The `embed_video` package is a common third-party library for embedding videos; it does not inherently contain malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the Issues\n- **Are any issues present?**  \n  No. The code is a typical migration script with no signs of vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or obfuscation.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n- No flawed reasoning or suspicious claims are evident.\n- The analysis in all reports correctly states that the code is a simple schema migration with no malicious intent.\n\n### Scores Review\n- All reports assign:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: mostly 0 or very low (0.1), which is reasonable given the benign nature.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.95 to 1), consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores\n- Since the code is a static migration script that creates a model with a third-party embedding library, the security risk is minimal.\n- No data flows, external inputs, or code execution are involved.\n- The `embed_video` package itself is not malicious; it's widely used for embedding videos.\n\n### Malware and Obfuscation\n- The malware score is correctly 0 across all reports.\n- Obfuscation is correctly identified as 0; the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n### Potential Vulnerabilities Based on Assumptions\n- No assumptions are made about external data or runtime behavior.\n- The reports avoid speculative claims and stick to factual analysis.\n\n### Consistency of Scores\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n- The slightly varying confidence levels are acceptable, but overall, the assessments are aligned.\n\n---\n\n### Final Personal Evaluation\n**Malware score:** 0 — the code is benign.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal, mainly due to third-party library use, but no actual security risk.\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- The code is a static schema migration, with no dynamic or runtime components.  \n- The third-party package used is standard and not suspicious.  \n- No data leaks, secrets, or malicious code are present.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate and well-reasoned. The code is safe, and the scores reflect that. No changes are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Malware: **0**  \n- Obfuscated: **0**  \n- Risk: **0.1** (due to third-party dependency, but overall very low risk)\n\nThis aligns with a typical benign Django migration script.",
