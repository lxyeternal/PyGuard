  "purpose": "Define a Django database migration for creating a Post model with a video field",
  "sources": "Code reads migration instructions and model field definitions; no external input sources",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform data leaks",
  "flows": "Not applicable; code is static migration definition without data flow execution",
  "anomalies": "Use of embed_video.fields.EmbedVideoField is a third-party package but not inherently malicious; no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django migration script that creates a 'Post' model with an 'id', 'title', and 'video' field. It imports necessary modules and defines a migration class with operations to create the model. No user input handling, no external data processing, and no suspicious code patterns are present. The embed_video package is commonly used for embedding videos and does not suggest malicious intent. There are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign Django migration script to create a model with a video field. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies. It appears safe and standard for Django applications.",
