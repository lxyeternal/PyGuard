  "purpose": "Define a Django migration for creating a 'Post' model with fields for ID, title, and an embedded video.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources; code defines database schema.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data outputs; no security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "N/A; code solely describes database model schema creation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of embed_video.fields.EmbedVideoField is standard for embedding videos; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django migration script generating a 'Post' model with a primary key, a title, and an embedded video field. It imports necessary modules and defines the migration operations straightforwardly. No suspicious code, no dynamic execution, no external data handling, or malicious logic present. The embed_video library is a common Django package for handling embedded videos and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Django migration script creating a model with standard fields. It does not contain malware or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
