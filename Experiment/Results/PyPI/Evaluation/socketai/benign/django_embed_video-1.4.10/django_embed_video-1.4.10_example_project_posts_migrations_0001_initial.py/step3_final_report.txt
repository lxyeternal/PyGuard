  "purpose": "Create a Django migration script that defines a Post model with an embedded video field.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the migration definitions and the embed_video.fields.EmbedVideoField declaration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not process external input or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "The code flows from model field definitions to database schema creation; no external data flows or code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is static, straightforward, and uses standard Django practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static Django migration script that creates a Post model with an auto-incrementing ID, a title, and a video field from a third-party package. It involves no dynamic code, user input, external data processing, or secrets. The embed_video package is widely used and not malicious. The code structure is clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present. The overall assessment is that the code is safe, with minimal security risk primarily due to third-party dependency usage, which is standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Django migration script that creates a Post model with a video field. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
