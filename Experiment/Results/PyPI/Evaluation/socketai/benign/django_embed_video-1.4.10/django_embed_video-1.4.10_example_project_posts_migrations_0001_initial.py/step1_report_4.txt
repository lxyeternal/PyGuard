  "purpose": "Define a Django migration to create a Post model with a video field.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; only model definition with static fields.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or potential data leaks; no processing of untrusted data or external communications.",
  "flows": "N/A; static model definition without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django migration script that creates a model named 'Post' with an 'id', 'title', and an embedded video field. It uses 'embed_video.fields.EmbedVideoField' without any dynamic or runtime code execution. There are no input/output handling, external data reads, or code that could be exploited. No obfuscation or malicious patterns detected. Overall, it appears to be a straightforward schema migration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Django migration for creating a model with a video field, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
