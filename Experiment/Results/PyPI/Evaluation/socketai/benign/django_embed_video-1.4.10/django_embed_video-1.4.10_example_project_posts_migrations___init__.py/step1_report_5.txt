  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or functionality related to a Python package, but no explicit purpose is clear from the provided snippet.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from environment variables, function parameters, or external data files (if any are present in the complete code). Specific source points are not explicitly visible in the provided fragment.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writing, or execution of system commands if present, but none are explicitly visible in the snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input, environment variables, or files to sinks like network, filesystem, or system commands, but specific paths are not detailed due to incomplete code.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are evident in the provided fragment. The code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The review was conducted step-by-step: first examining the initial code for any malicious imports or hidden behaviors, then analyzing any function definitions, data handling, and control flow. No suspicious patterns, malicious functions, or unusual behavior were identified. The code uses common Python features without signs of obfuscation or malicious constructs. Without additional context or code, it appears to be standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears legitimate and free of malicious or sabotage-related features.",
