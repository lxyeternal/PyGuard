{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a benign Python module with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious activity detected.",
  "sources": "The code reads input via import statements and function definitions, with no external data sources or untrusted input handling evident.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or malicious effects, such as network connections or file modifications.",
  "flows": "No malicious or suspicious data flow paths are present; the code structure suggests standard execution without external data influence.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code constructs are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, consisting mainly of imports and function definitions, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The confidence in benign assessment is high (0.9), and no suspicious patterns or network activity are detected. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (0.1), reflecting minimal concern given the limited context.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code is benign with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores are consistent with the benign assessment, and no further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
