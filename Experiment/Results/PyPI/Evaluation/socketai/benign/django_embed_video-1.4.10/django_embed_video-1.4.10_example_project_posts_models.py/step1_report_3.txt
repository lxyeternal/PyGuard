  "purpose": "Define a Django model for storing posts with embedded videos",
  "sources": "Django model fields (title, video), reverse URL resolution in get_absolute_url method",
  "sinks": "reverse() function in get_absolute_url method, which constructs URLs based on the model's primary key",
  "flows": "Model instance's pk -> get_absolute_url() -> reverse() -> URL string",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no use of environment variables, no suspicious or unusual code constructs. EmbedVideoField depends on an external package, but its usage here is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple Django model with a CharField and an EmbedVideoField, along with a __unicode__ method and a get_absolute_url method. The get_absolute_url method uses Django's reverse function to generate URLs based on a URL pattern named 'posts:detail' with the model's primary key. There are no input/output streams, external data sources, or untrusted data flows that could lead to data leaks or code injection. The code appears standard and straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. Usage of external package 'embed_video' is common for embedding videos in Django models, and it does not introduce security issues by itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django model implementation with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It safely constructs URLs for post instances. No anomalies or malicious intent detected.",
