  "purpose": "Define a Django model named Post with fields for title and embedded video, including URL resolution.",
  "sources": "Django model fields, embed_video.fields for video input, reverse URL lookup in get_absolute_url",
  "sinks": "reverse() function potentially resolving URLs, model's __unicode__ method returning title",
  "flows": "Input from user or database flows into model fields, get_absolute_url may handle URL parameters, __unicode__ uses title",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. Use of EmbedVideoField is standard for embedding videos.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a standard Django model with no apparent malicious behavior. EmbedVideoField is used for video embedding, which is safe if from a reputable library. reverse() usage is standard for URL resolution. The __unicode__ method returns the title, typical for display purposes. No user input is directly processed insecurely, and no suspicious data handling or external connections are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward Django model with standard practices. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks detected.",
