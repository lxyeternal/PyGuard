{
  "purpose": "Define a Django model named Post with fields for title and embedded video, including URL resolution.",
  "sources": "Imports from django.db, django.urls, and embed_video.fields; class attributes; method definitions.",
  "sinks": "reverse() function for URL resolution, which uses the model's primary key.",
  "flows": "User input (possibly through model instance creation) flows into title, video fields, and ultimately the get_absolute_url method.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious or malicious code, no dynamic code execution, and no unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary Django modules and an embed video field for video embedding. The Post model has straightforward fields for title and video, with no user input processing beyond model instantiation. The get_absolute_url method constructs URLs based on model PK, which is standard. No evidence of code injection, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The use of reverse() is typical for URL resolution in Django projects. The __unicode__ method (Python 2 style) returns the title, which is benign, assuming the environment is Python 2, otherwise should be __str__ in Python 3. Overall, the code appears to be standard Django model code with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard Django model definition with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It simply defines data fields and URL resolution for a Post object.",
