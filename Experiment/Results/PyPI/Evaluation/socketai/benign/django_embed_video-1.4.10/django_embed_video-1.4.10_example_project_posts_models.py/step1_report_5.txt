  "purpose": "Define a Django model for blog posts with embedded videos and provide URL resolution.",
  "sources": "Import statements for Django models, URL reverse function, and EmbedVideoField; class attribute definitions; methods for string representation and URL resolution.",
  "sinks": "None in this code; no untrusted data processing or external outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; methods are standard and do not process external input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. Use of EmbedVideoField depends on third-party implementation but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django model 'Post' with two fields: a character field for title and an embed video field for videos. The __unicode__ method provides a string representation. get_absolute_url uses Django's reverse to generate URLs. The code relies on standard Django practices and a third-party embed video package. No input sanitization, external data handling, or insecure patterns are observed. No signs of obfuscation or malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward Django model with no malicious or suspicious elements. It utilizes standard libraries and practices without any apparent security risks or malware behaviors.",
