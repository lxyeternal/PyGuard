  "purpose": "Define a Django model named Post with fields for title and embedded video, and provide methods for string representation and URL resolution.",
  "sources": "Import statements for Django models, URL reversing, and embed_video field; class attributes; methods for string representation and URL generation.",
  "sinks": "Reverse URL lookup in get_absolute_url() method.",
  "flows": "Input (model data) flows through get_absolute_url() to reverse URL resolution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, unusual code, or suspicious behavior detected. The embed_video.fields.EmbedVideoField usage is standard for embedding videos.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django model with standard fields and methods. It imports necessary modules, defines a Post model with title and video fields, and includes methods for string representation and URL resolution. The embed_video field is a third-party library for embedding videos, used here as intended. No signs of malicious code, such as network calls, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are present. The get_absolute_url method uses Django's reverse function to generate URLs securely, without executing untrusted data.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward Django model implementation with no malicious behavior or security risks. It correctly uses Django and third-party libraries as intended, with no suspicious or malicious code present.",
