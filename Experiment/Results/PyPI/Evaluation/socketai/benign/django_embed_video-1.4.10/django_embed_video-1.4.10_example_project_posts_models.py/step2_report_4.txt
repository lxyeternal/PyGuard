  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Defines a Django model `Post` with fields:\n  - `title`: CharField\n  - `video`: EmbedVideoField (from a third-party package)\n- Implements `__unicode__` method returning `title` (Python 2 style; in Python 3, should be `__str__`)\n- Implements `get_absolute_url` using `reverse()` with URL pattern `\"posts:detail\"` and the model's primary key\n- Uses standard Django practices, no apparent malicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no external data flows or suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Standard model with URL resolution.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, no malicious behavior, reverse() usage is typical.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 (slightly above zero, but given the code's nature, this seems high)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate; the code is standard. The security risk score might be slightly high; the code itself doesn't introduce risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, with focus on string representation and URL resolution.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, embed_video usage is standard.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (low)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar, focusing on URL resolution.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious code, standard URL resolution.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Basic Django model with URL resolution.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns, standard practices.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Standard Django model.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, no external data handling.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of malware:** All reports assign malware score 0, which aligns with the code's content. No malicious code, network calls, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk scores:** Most reports assign very low or zero risk scores. The first report assigns 0.2, which seems slightly high given the code's simplicity. Since the code is standard Django model code with no external data handling, I would reduce this to 0 or 0.1 at most.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low; perhaps a minimal concern if the embed_video package is untrusted, but assuming it's a reputable third-party library, this is acceptable)\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The `__unicode__` method is Python 2 style; in Python 3, it should be `__str__`. This is not a security issue but a compatibility concern.\n- The code's security posture is sound; no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.\n\n---\n\n## **Final assessment:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Value | Justification                                               |\n|----------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0            | No malicious code or behavior present                        |\n| Obfuscated     | 0            | Clear, straightforward code without obfuscation             |\n| Security Risk  | 0.1          | Minimal, just standard URL resolution; no external threats |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, benign Django model with no signs of supply chain attack, malware, or obfuscation. The low risk score reflects its simplicity and adherence to best practices.",
