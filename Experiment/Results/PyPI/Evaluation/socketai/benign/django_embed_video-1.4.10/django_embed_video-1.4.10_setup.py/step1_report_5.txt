  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'django-embed-video' Python package, facilitating installation, package discovery, and metadata definition.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' and 'CHANGES.rst' files for long description content.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processing or external command execution.",
  "flows": "Reading files for long description, then passing data to setup functions without user input or external data influence.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'open' to read files during setup is standard; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns detected. The 'setup_requires' entry includes 'readme', which is unusual unless 'readme' is a custom build dependency, but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and configures package metadata, dependencies, and setup parameters. It reads 'README.rst' and 'CHANGES.rst' files to generate long description content, which is typical for package setup scripts. No code injection, data leakage, or suspicious external connections are observed. The dependencies listed are standard. The presence of 'setup_requires' and 'install_requires' is normal for Python packaging. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a standard, benign package configuration for a Django project, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
