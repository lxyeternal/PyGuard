{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package called 'django-embed-video', including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads files 'README.rst' and 'CHANGES.rst' for long description; reads package data files; gathers package info and dependencies; specifies setup and test requirements.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external communication; setup process does not execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Reads files during setup to populate package metadata; dependencies are specified but not dynamically fetched or executed at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hidden dynamic execution, or hardcoded secrets. Use of 'open' to read files is standard for setup scripts. No anomalies in code structure.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup operations for a Python package using setuptools. It reads static files for description, defines dependencies, and specifies package data. No input from external sources at runtime, no dynamic code execution, no network communication, and no sensitive data handling. It follows typical package configuration patterns without obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script for packaging a Django application. It contains no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a straightforward configuration file with standard practices.",
