{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'django-embed-video' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading README.rst and CHANGES.rst files for long description; importing setup utilities; reading package data; specifying dependencies.",
  "sinks": "Potentially reading external files (README.rst, CHANGES.rst) during setup, but these are standard and harmless in this context.",
  "flows": "Reading external files for description -> configuring package setup parameters -> specifying dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or hidden operations detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for a Python package using setuptools. It reads two documentation files for long description, defines package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. The only file I/O involves reading README and CHANGES files, which is standard practice. No external network calls, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns are present. The dependencies are standard and safe. The script performs no malicious actions or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py script appears to be legitimate, straightforward, and free of malicious or suspicious behavior. It functions as a conventional package setup file with no indicators of malware or security risks.",
