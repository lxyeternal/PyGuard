  "purpose": "Setup script for a Django package 'django-embed-video' to facilitate embedding videos and music from various sources.",
  "sources": "Reading README.rst and CHANGES.rst files for long_description; importing package metadata; reading environment variables implicitly through package setup process.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or executes untrusted input; setup functions used for packaging only.",
  "flows": "Reading files for long_description (source) and passing static configuration data (sink), with no dynamic data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated logic. Use of 'open' without exception handling is typical in setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python setup configuration using setuptools. It reads static files for package description, specifies dependencies, and defines package metadata. No code injection, no network activity, no dynamic code execution or user input processing is present. The dependencies are normal, and all functions used are standard for package setup. The only noteworthy point is the use of 'open' without error handling, which is typical in such scripts and does not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It follows standard practices for package distribution and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
