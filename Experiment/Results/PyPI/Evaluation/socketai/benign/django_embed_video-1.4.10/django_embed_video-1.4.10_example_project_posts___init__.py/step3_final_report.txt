  "purpose": "Assess supply chain security of the open source dependency by analyzing provided code snippets for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code inputs, data reading functions, environment variable accesses, network connections, file operations.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file writes, environment variable usage, system commands, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "From data sources (inputs, environment variables) to sinks (network, file system, system commands).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected; code appears benign and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is absent or minimal, with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. High confidence (0.9) in benign assessment. No suspicious data flows or malicious sinks identified. The code structure is straightforward, with no complex or obfuscated patterns. No external network connections or data exfiltration points are present. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk, with malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and a low security risk score around 0.2.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, consistent with the absence of code or suspicious patterns. The scores are appropriate and conservative, reflecting the current evidence.",
