  "purpose": "Define URL patterns for a Django web application to route requests to specific views for posts.",
  "sources": "User HTTP requests via URL patterns; imported views (PostListView, PostDetailView)",
  "sinks": "Calling view methods (as_view()), which process incoming requests and generate responses",
  "flows": "URL pattern matches -> invokes corresponding view's as_view() -> processes request",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code, no suspicious imports or patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary Django URL functions and two views. It defines URL patterns for post detail and list views using regular expressions. There are no signs of malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. The URL patterns are standard and appropriate for Django projects. No external data sources or sinks are accessed directly within this snippet, and no unusual code flow is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical Django URL configuration without any malicious or suspicious elements. It safely maps URLs to views for posts. No malicious intent or security risks are evident in this code.",
