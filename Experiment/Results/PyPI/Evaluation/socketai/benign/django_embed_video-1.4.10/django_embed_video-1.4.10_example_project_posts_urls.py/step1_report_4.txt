  "purpose": "Define URL routing patterns for a Django web application, mapping URLs to specific view functions or classes.",
  "sources": "The code reads URL pattern strings and imports views from the local views module.",
  "sinks": "The URL patterns are used internally by Django to route incoming HTTP requests; no external data sinks are involved.",
  "flows": "User requests matching URL regex patterns are routed to PostDetailView or PostListView based on URL matching.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious dynamic code, or unusual patterns are present. URL regex patterns are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary Django URL functions and view classes, then defines URL patterns using 're_path' with regex. Patterns appear standard for mapping post details by primary key and listing posts. No external data, credentials, or malicious code execution points are detected. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical URL routing configuration for a Django app, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
