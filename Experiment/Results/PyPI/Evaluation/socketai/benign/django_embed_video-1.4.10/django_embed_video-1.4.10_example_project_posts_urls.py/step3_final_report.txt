  "purpose": "Defines URL patterns for post detail and list views in a Django application.",
  "sources": "URL regex patterns matching numeric primary key and root URL.",
  "sinks": "None; URL patterns do not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "URL matching flows from incoming request URLs to corresponding views.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard URL regex patterns, no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Django URL configuration defining two URL patterns: one capturing a numeric primary key for post details, and one for the post list at the root URL. The regex patterns are standard and do not involve dynamic code execution, external data, or suspicious constructs. The views are imported from local modules, and no untrusted data is processed within this snippet. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with high confidence scores and no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The regex patterns are common and safe, and the code does not contain any malicious payloads or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe Django URL configuration with no malicious activity or security issues. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
