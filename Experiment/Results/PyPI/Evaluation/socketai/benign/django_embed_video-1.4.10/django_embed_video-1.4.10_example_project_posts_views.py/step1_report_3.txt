  "purpose": "Define web views for listing posts and displaying post details in a Django application.",
  "sources": "Importing ListView and DetailView from django.views.generic; importing Post model from local models.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external communication; no data leaks or insecure operations.",
  "flows": "The views use standard Django class-based generic views to process and display data from the Post model, with no explicit data input or external output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual code constructs, no backdoors, or suspicious logic. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard Django generic views and a model, then defines two view classes for listing posts and showing post details. There are no input handling, no external communications, or operations that could be exploited maliciously. No data leaks, no malicious code, and no suspicious behaviors are present. The structure and content follow typical Django patterns, indicating a simple and safe implementation.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, benign Django views implementation for post listing and detail display. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks present.",
