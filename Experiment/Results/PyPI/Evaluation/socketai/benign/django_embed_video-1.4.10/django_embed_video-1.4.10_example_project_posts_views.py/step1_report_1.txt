  "purpose": "Define Django class-based views for listing and detailing Post objects",
  "sources": "Import statements for Django generic views and Post model",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or output",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; views rely on Django framework for data handling",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected; straightforward use of Django views",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard Django generic views and a model, then defines two view classes for listing posts and viewing post details. There are no external inputs handled directly in this snippet, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious imports, and no sensitive data management. It appears to be standard Django boilerplate code with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of Django views for listing and detail display of posts with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
