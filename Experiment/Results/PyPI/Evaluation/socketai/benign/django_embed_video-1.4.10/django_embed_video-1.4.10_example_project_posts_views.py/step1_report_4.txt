{
  "purpose": "The code defines Django class-based views for listing and detailing 'Post' objects, used in a web application to display content.",
  "sources": "Imports from django.views.generic and the local models module; data sources are likely database queries for 'Post' objects.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as system calls, network operations, or data writes are present; potential vulnerabilities are limited to standard data retrieval.",
  "flows": "User requests for list or detail views trigger database queries via Django ORM, with data passed to templates for rendering; no untrusted data processing or external interactions are evident.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears straightforward and adheres to common Django patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django generic views and a model, then defines two classes for listing posts with pagination and viewing post details. It follows standard Django practices without any suspicious logic, external data handling, or insecure patterns. There are no sources of untrusted input beyond typical web request parameters, and no data is written or transmitted insecurely. The code is minimal and appears safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of Django views for content listing and detail display, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
