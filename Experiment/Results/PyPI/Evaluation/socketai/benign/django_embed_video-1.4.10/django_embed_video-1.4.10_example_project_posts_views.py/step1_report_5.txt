  "purpose": "The code defines Django generic class-based views for listing and detailing 'Post' objects.",
  "sources": "Django's ListView and DetailView classes, and the imported 'Post' model.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the database model 'Post' to the views, which render templates based on the request.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no unusual code constructs, no dynamic execution, no suspicious imports or patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of Django generic views for listing and viewing posts. It imports necessary classes and models, and defines two views with standard attributes. No user input handling, no external data sources, and no suspicious code structures are present. The code appears to be standard, secure, and typical for a Django application.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign Django views implementation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
