  "purpose": "Standard Django views for listing and detailing Post objects, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Django's ListView and DetailView classes, which handle data retrieval and rendering without processing untrusted input.",
  "sinks": "Rendering templates with data from the Post model; no external data sinks or network operations are involved.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the Post model through Django's generic views to templates; no untrusted data sources or external sinks are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard implementation of Django class-based views for listing and viewing Post objects. It imports Django's generic views and the Post model, then defines two views with typical attributes. There are no inputs, outputs, or external interactions beyond Django's built-in mechanisms. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are evident. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The only minor point is the risk score in Report 4 being 0.1, which is slightly inflated given the code's simplicity. It should be adjusted to 0 for consistency. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly zero. Overall, the code is safe, and the scores should reflect that.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign Django implementation for listing and viewing posts. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The reports are accurate, and the risk score should be adjusted from 0.1 to 0.0 in Report 4 for consistency.",
