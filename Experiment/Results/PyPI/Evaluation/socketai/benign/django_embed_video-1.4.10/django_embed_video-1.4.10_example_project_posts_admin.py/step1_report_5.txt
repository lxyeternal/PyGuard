  "purpose": "Registering the Post model with the Django admin interface and adding video embedding capabilities.",
  "sources": "The code imports models from the local app, the Django admin, and an external embed_video.admin module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data leaks or untrusted data handling; no data processing or external communication present.",
  "flows": "The code flows from imports to model registration in the admin interface, with no data manipulation or untrusted data sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward, utilizing standard Django admin registration and a third-party mixin for video embedding.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for admin interface registration and video embedding. It defines a custom admin class for the Post model that inherits from AdminVideoMixin and ModelAdmin, then registers this model with the admin site. There are no signs of malicious code, hardcoded secrets, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. The use of the embed_video library appears legitimate for enhancing admin capabilities. No unusual code constructs, obfuscation, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Django admin registration with a third-party video embedding extension. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks in this snippet.",
