  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code, reasoning, and scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward Django admin registration with a third-party embed_video mixin.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws is found.\n- The code is static, with no data processing, external inputs, or dynamic code execution.\n- The use of `AdminVideoMixin` is standard for media embedding, not inherently suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review per report:\n\n#### Report 1\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no malware.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No change needed.\n\n#### Report 2\n- **Findings:** Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.1). The reasoning is that embedding media could pose risks, but in this context, it's standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Verdict:** Justified. No malware, only a minimal security risk due to media embedding, which is acceptable.\n\n#### Report 3\n- **Findings:** Same as above; no malicious activity, standard setup.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Verdict:** Correct. No change needed.\n\n#### Report 4\n- **Findings:** Slightly higher confidence (0.9) and securityRisk (0.1). The reasoning is consistent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate. No malware, minimal security risk.\n\n#### Report 5\n- **Findings:** Same as others; standard registration, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports, justified by the inclusion of media embedding, which could introduce attack vectors if misused, but in this context, it's minimal.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent with the code and reasoning.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minor risk associated with media embedding, acceptable in this context)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard Django admin setup with a third-party media embedding plugin. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident, and the risk scores reflect the minimal potential security concern accurately.",
