{
  "purpose": "Registering a Post model with Django admin interface with video embedding capabilities",
  "sources": "Import statements: django.contrib.admin, embed_video.admin, and local models",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data; standard Django admin registration",
  "flows": "Imports lead to registration of Post model with admin site, no data flow from external inputs",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures; the use of embed_video is standard for media handling",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django admin modules, a third-party embed_video module, and a local Post model. It defines a PostAdmin class that extends AdminVideoMixin and admin.ModelAdmin without additional logic, then registers the Post model with this admin class. There are no dynamic code executions, no handling of untrusted input, no suspicious behaviors, or obfuscated code. The code appears straightforward and standard for Django admin configuration with media embedding.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Django admin registration for a Post model with video embedding support. There are no signs of malicious intent, security issues, or obfuscated/malicious behavior.",
