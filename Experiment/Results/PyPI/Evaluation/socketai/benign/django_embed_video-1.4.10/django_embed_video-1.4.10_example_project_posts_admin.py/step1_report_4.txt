{
  "purpose": "Registering the Post model with the Django admin site using a mixin for embedding videos.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources; uses model data for admin registration.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs; the code is configuration for Django admin interface.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; mainly setup code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, unusual code, or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django admin components and a third-party 'embed_video' admin mixin, then registers the Post model with the admin site. The 'AdminVideoMixin' could potentially add video embedding capabilities but does not by itself introduce security issues. There are no input sources, data leaks, or malicious behaviors observed. The code appears to be standard Django admin setup with a third-party plugin for video embedding, which is common and safe in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Django admin registration with a third-party video embedding mixin. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks present.",
