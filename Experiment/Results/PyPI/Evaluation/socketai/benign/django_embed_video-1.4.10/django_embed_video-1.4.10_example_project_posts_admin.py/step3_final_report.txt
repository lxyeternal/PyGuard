  "purpose": "Register Post model in Django admin with media embedding support via AdminVideoMixin.",
  "sources": "Import statements for Django admin, embed_video.admin, and Post model; class definition for PostAdmin; admin.site.register call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, external calls, or dynamic code execution present; no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Import modules -> define PostAdmin class -> register Post with admin site; no data flows involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Django admin registration enhanced with a third-party media embedding mixin. It involves no dynamic code execution, no handling of untrusted input, and uses standard libraries and patterns. The embed_video library is common for media embedding and does not introduce inherent security risks. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is present. The minimal security risk scores assigned in the reports (mostly 0, some 0.1) are appropriate given the context. The malware score is correctly 0, indicating no malicious intent. The overall structure and content are benign and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Django admin setup with media embedding support, free of malicious or suspicious content. Security assessments should assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk score (~0), reflecting its benign nature.",
