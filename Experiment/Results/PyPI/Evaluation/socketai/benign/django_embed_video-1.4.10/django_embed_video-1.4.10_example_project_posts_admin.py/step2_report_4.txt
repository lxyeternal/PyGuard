  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Overall Code Review:**\n- The code is a straightforward Django admin registration for the Post model.\n- It uses `AdminVideoMixin` from a third-party `embed_video` package to add video embedding capabilities.\n- There are no dynamic data flows, no untrusted input handling, no external calls beyond standard imports, and no obfuscation.\n- The code does not contain any hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs.\n- The purpose appears to be purely administrative with media embedding support.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Register Post with video embedding.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious or suspicious behavior; standard code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Same as above, standard Django admin setup.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1.\n\n**Note:** The `securityRisk` is set at 0.1, which is very low. Since there's no actual vulnerability or suspicious behavior, this seems reasonable. The small risk might be due to third-party dependency or embedding media, but nothing malicious is indicated.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- Same reasoning applies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- Same analysis.\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), possibly due to caution around third-party plugins.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- Same as above.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports, reflecting minimal potential concern due to third-party embedding libraries, but no actual vulnerabilities.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, mainly due to third-party dependency, not an actual risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent, accurate, and appropriately cautious. No adjustments needed.",
