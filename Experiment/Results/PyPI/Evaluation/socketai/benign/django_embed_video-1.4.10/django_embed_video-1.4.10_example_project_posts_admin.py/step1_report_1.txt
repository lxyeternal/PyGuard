  "purpose": "Register the Post model with Django admin, enhanced with video embedding capabilities via AdminVideoMixin.",
  "sources": "Import statements for Django admin, embed_video.admin, and the Post model; class definition for PostAdmin.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data; code primarily registers a model with admin site.",
  "flows": "Import of Post model → registration via admin.site.register(Post, PostAdmin).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. Usage of AdminVideoMixin may handle media, but without suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django admin modules and a third-party embed_video module. Defines a simple admin class for the Post model, inheriting from AdminVideoMixin to enable video embedding functionality in the admin interface. Registers the Post model with the admin site using this admin class. No dynamic code execution, no data leaks, and no suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears straightforward and standard for Django projects incorporating media embedding.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Django admin registration with media embedding support. There are no signs of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks in this fragment.",
