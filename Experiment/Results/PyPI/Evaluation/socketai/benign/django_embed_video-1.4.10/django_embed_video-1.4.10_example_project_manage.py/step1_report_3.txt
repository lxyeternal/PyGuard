  "purpose": "This script initializes the environment for a Django project and runs management commands.",
  "sources": "os.environ.setdefault() setting 'DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', sys.argv for command-line arguments",
  "sinks": "execute_from_command_line() which executes commands based on sys.argv",
  "flows": "sys.argv -> execute_from_command_line() -> performs actions based on input; os.environ -> Django environment setup",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code sets a Django environment variable for settings, imports Django management, and executes commands from CLI arguments. It follows standard Django management script structure. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, obfuscated code, or unusual flows are present. The environment variable setting is typical for Django projects. The command execution depends on CLI input, which is standard but requires trust in the command-line arguments used.",
  "conclusion": "This script appears to be a standard Django management utility setup without malicious intent or security risks. It performs expected operations to initialize and run Django commands based on user input.",
