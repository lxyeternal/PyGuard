  "flows": "sys.argv → execute_from_command_line",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward standard pattern",
  "analysis": "The code sets a Django environment variable and invokes Django's command-line utility with sys.argv. It is a typical Django management script with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. The primary concern is that sys.argv is untrusted input, which could be manipulated to execute unintended commands if environment is compromised. However, this is inherent to Django management scripts and relies on controlled input. No suspicious patterns or anomalies are present. The code is clear, standard, and safe, with minimal inherent security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Django management script with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The slight security risk stems from executing commands based on untrusted input, which is typical for such scripts. Proper environment controls mitigate this risk. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for use.",
