  "purpose": "This script is a Django management utility to set environment variables and execute command-line management commands for a Django project.",
  "sources": "os.environ.setdefault() for setting environment variable, sys.argv for command-line arguments",
  "sinks": "execute_from_command_line() which executes management commands potentially based on untrusted input",
  "flows": "sys.argv → execute_from_command_line (with environment variable set)",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual behavior. Standard Django setup code.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a Django environment by setting a default settings module. It then imports Django's management execution function and runs it with command-line arguments. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The environment variable is a standard setting for Django projects, and execution relies on input parameters. No external network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious code are present. Overall, this appears to be a typical Django management script.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Django project startup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
