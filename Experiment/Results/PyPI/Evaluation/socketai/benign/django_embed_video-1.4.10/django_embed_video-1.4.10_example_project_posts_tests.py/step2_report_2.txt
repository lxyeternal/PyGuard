  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple Django test case, asserting that 1 + 1 equals 2.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no hardcoded secrets.\n   - There are no sinks, flows, or anomalies indicating malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n2. **Malware & Obfuscated Scores**:\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - Obfuscated score is also 0, consistent with the code's clarity and lack of obfuscation.\n\n3. **Security & Risk Scores**:\n   - All reports assign a security risk of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The overall risk score is 0, matching the analysis.\n\n4. **Score Justification & Consistency**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis.\n   - Since the code is a standard example/test case with no malicious or suspicious features, the scores seem reasonable.\n\n5. **Potential Issues or Assumptions**:\n   - No issues are detected; the reports are thorough and accurate.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is cautious and correct.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment**:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**My own estimates** align perfectly with the reports:\n\n> **Malware:** 0  \n> **Obfuscated:** 0  \n> **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate and reasonable given the code's simplicity and benign nature. No changes are necessary.",
