  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets. No dynamic execution or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django's testing framework and defines a straightforward test case that checks if 1 + 1 equals 2. It contains no external data inputs, no data leaks, and no side effects. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks. The code appears to be a standard example or placeholder test.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard test example with no malicious intent or security issues. It performs a simple arithmetic assertion without any external dependencies or suspicious code.",
