  "purpose": "This code demonstrates a basic unit test using Django's testing framework, primarily for educational or development purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module imports (django.test), and the test class and method definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that could lead to data leaks, code execution, or malicious effects are present.",
  "flows": "Input or data flow is minimal; the test runs a simple assertion without external data sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behavior detected. The code is straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django's TestCase, defines a simple test class, and contains one test method that asserts 1 + 1 equals 2. It contains no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, and no side effects. The purpose appears to be instructional or placeholder testing. There are no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for Django testing, and contains no malicious behavior or security issues.",
