  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code is purely illustrative.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and standard for testing purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard testing framework from Django and defines a simple test case that verifies basic arithmetic. There are no suspicious or malicious constructs, no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, and no external communications. The code appears to be a minimal example or template for writing tests and contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign example of a unit test case with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
