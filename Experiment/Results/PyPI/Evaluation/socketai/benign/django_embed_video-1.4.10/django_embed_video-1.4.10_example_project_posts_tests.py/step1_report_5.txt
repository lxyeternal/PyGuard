  "purpose": "Demonstrates writing unit tests using the Django testing framework.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'django.test.TestCase'; code within the 'SimpleTest' class and its method.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data; no data leaks or malicious actions evident.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code executes a simple test assertion.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs. The code is straightforward and standard for Django tests.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Django TestCase class and defines a basic test class with a single test method. The test checks if 1 + 1 equals 2, a trivial assertion. There are no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, no network communication, and no suspicious behavior or obfuscation present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, harmless Django test example with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
