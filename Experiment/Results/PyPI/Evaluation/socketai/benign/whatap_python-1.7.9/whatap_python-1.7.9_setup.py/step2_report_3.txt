  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the original code to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard setup script with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, data leaks, or malware indicators.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, which aligns with the benign assessment.\n- **Assessment:** This is consistent and reasonable. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Also a standard setup script, with the only notable point being the dynamic setting of `build.release_date`.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, credentials, or obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score (0.2):** Slightly elevated but still low, justified by the dynamic attribute assignment, which is common in build scripts.\n- **Malware Score (0):** Correct, no malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The scores seem appropriate; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, standard setup script.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, suspicious code, or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Risk 0, Malware 0, matching the benign nature.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard packaging script with straightforward logic.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity; the use of `open()` and entry points are typical.\n- **Scores:** Risk 0, Malware 0.\n- **Assessment:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a typical setup script.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code; the dynamic `build.release_date` is benign.\n- **Scores:** Risk 0.1, Malware 0.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly elevated risk score due to dynamic attribute assignment, but still reasonable given the context.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Presence:** All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware:** All scores are 0, which is correct.\n- **Obfuscated:** All are 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slight variations (0.1–0.2) are justified based on the dynamic assignment of `build.release_date`, which is common in build scripts and not malicious.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the consistent benign nature, I would assign a **risk score of 0.1** across all reports, reflecting minimal inherent risk due to dynamic build attribute assignment but recognizing that it's a common pattern in setup scripts.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Metric             | Final Suggested Score |\n|--------------------|------------------------|\n| Malware            | **0**                |\n| Obfuscated         | **0**                |\n| Risk               | **0.1**              |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a typical, benign setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The small risk score accounts for the dynamic attribute assignment but does not indicate any malicious intent.",
