  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code segments involving dynamic execution (eval/exec), network communication, hardcoded IPs/domains, obfuscated strings, and input/output data handling.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file I/O, environment variables, decoding routines, and dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as obfuscated strings or network inputs flow into eval/exec or decoding functions, potentially leading to malicious actions or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names, encoded payloads, dynamic code execution, hardcoded suspicious domains/IPs, and network activity without clear benign purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits typical malicious indicators such as obfuscation, dynamic execution, and network communication with suspicious endpoints. The high scores (malware: 0.8, obfuscated: 0.8, securityRisk: 0.9) are justified by these features. Benign code lacks such traits, reflected in zero scores. The assessments are consistent with the described features, and no false positives are evident. The reasoning aligns with standard security evaluation practices.",
  "conclusion": "Report 2 indicates a high likelihood of malicious behavior due to obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and network activity, warranting high scores. Other reports are benign, with low or zero scores appropriately reflecting their nature. The scoring is consistent with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary.",
