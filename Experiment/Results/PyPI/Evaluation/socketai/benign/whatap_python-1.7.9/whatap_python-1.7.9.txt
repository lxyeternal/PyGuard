      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The minor risk scores are justified by routine dynamic build metadata assignment but do not indicate any threat. Overall, the supply chain security risk from this code is minimal."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate monitoring and instrumentation agent with system-level interactions. While it performs operations that could be misused (e.g., permission changes, output suppression, symlink creation), there is no evidence of malicious intent or payloads. Its design aligns with typical monitoring tools, but caution is advised in untrusted environments due to its system manipulations."

The low security risk score is appropriate, contingent on the external library's behavior. Further review of 'whatap' documentation is recommended for complete assurance."

      "conclusion": "Report 2 indicates a high likelihood of malicious behavior due to obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and network activity, warranting high scores. Other reports are benign, with low or zero scores appropriately reflecting their nature. The scoring is consistent with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary."

The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk is low (~0.2). The main improvement is fixing the typo and adding error handling if needed."
