  "purpose": "Invoke the 'agent' function from the 'whatap' package, likely for monitoring or telemetry purposes.",
  "sources": "Import of 'agent' from 'whatap' package",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'agent()' which may perform network communication or data collection",
  "flows": "Import 'agent' -> call 'agent()' in main block",
  "anomalies": "None observed; straightforward import and call, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'agent' from 'whatap' and executes it if run as main. The 'whatap' library is known for monitoring, so 'agent()' likely performs telemetry or data collection. No malicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. The security concern depends on the internal behavior of 'agent()', which cannot be determined from this snippet. Malware score is 0; code is benign. Security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting potential data collection but no evidence of malicious activity. Confidence is high (~0.8), given the simplicity and known library purpose. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign invocation of a monitoring agent from a trusted library. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The low security risk score is appropriate, contingent on the external library's behavior. Further review of 'whatap' documentation is recommended for complete assurance.",
