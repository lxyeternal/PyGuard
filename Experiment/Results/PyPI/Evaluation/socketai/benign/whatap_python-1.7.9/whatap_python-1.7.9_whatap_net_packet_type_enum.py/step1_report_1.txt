{
  "purpose": "Define a class with constants representing different packet types or message identifiers for network or communication protocols.",
  "sources": "Constants are assigned integer values directly within the class definition.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or external data processing observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the class is static with predefined values.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns detected. No dynamic execution, backdoors, or malicious indicators.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a class with class-level integer constants serving as identifiers. No input handling, network operations, or external data processing present. The constants appear to categorize different packet or message types, which is typical in communication protocols. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks evident from this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward enumeration of packet type constants without any malicious or suspicious activity. It is safe and appears to be part of a larger protocol or messaging system.",
