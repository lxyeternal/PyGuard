  "purpose": "Define packet type constants for network or protocol messaging.",
  "sources": "Class attributes representing packet type identifiers.",
  "sinks": "No data input/output or external data sources; static constants only.",
  "flows": "No data flow; constants are used as identifiers in other code modules.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static class with no dynamic or suspicious elements.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static class defining integer constants for various packet types. It contains no dynamic logic, input handling, network operations, or obfuscation. The constants cover different message categories such as transmission, HTTP, SQL, security, events, and relay packets. Given its static, straightforward nature, there are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities. The code is typical for protocol message definitions and does not include any secrets or obfuscated code. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's characteristics.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard enumeration of packet type constants with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its nature, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action or modifications are necessary.",
