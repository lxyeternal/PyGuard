{
  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration class for various packet types used in network or data processing operations.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; static class attributes define constant values.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; code does not process or transmit data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the class only declares constants without runtime logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class defining constant integer values for packet types. No input handling, no dynamic code execution, no network connections, or other suspicious behaviors are present. It appears to be a standard enumeration pattern for clarity in a larger system.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign enumeration class used for defining packet type constants. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It is a typical pattern used in network or protocol implementations.",
