  "purpose": "Define a set of constants representing different packet types for use in a network or communication protocol.",
  "sources": "N/A (no input or data reading code present)",
  "sinks": "N/A (no data output or untrusted data handling present)",
  "flows": "N/A (no data flow or data manipulation present)",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded constant values with descriptive names; no suspicious or malicious code behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class defining constant integer values for packet types, likely used in a communication protocol. It does not contain any input handling, external data reading, or dynamic code execution. No indications of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely defines constants for packet types and does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a standard enumeration pattern for protocol messaging.",
