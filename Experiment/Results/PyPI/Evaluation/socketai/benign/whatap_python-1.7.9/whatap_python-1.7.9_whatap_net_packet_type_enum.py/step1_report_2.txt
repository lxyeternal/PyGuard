  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration class for various packet types used in network or data communication protocols.",
  "sources": "No input data sources; static class attributes are defined.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data propagation detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The class is a straightforward enumeration of packet type constants with assigned integer values. There are no dynamic code execution, data handling, or network operations within this code snippet. It appears to be a static configuration or constant definitions without any embedded logic that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple enumeration definition for packet types, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
