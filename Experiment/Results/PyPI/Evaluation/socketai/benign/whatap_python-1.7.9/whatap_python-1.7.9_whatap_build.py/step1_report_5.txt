  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Simple variable assignments with static strings; no obfuscation, no dynamic code, no hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of straightforward variable assignments setting metadata information about a Python package. There are no functions, external data reads, or suspicious operations. No signs of malicious behavior or malicious intent are evident. The static nature of the code indicates it is likely part of a configuration or metadata module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, representing package metadata with no malicious activity or security risks detected.",
