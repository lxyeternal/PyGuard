  "purpose": "This code snippet defines some metadata variables related to a Python package or application, including its name, version, release date, and the language.",
  "sources": "Variables assignment statements at the beginning of the code",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow points involving untrusted data or external input",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code merely assigns static string values",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials (other than standard metadata), or suspicious constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple variable assignments with static string values, representing package metadata. There are no inputs, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no apparent malicious behavior. The variables appear to be standard package identifiers or version info, typical in package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward declaration of package metadata with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not perform any harmful actions or data leaks.",
