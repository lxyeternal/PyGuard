  "purpose": "The code defines some basic package metadata variables, likely for a Python package or application.",
  "sources": "Variable assignments at the beginning of the code (app, name, version, release_date).",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing, external communication, or untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; there are no source-to-sink data flows.",
  "anomalies": "The code is very minimal, with only static variable assignments. No suspicious or unusual code patterns are present. No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns string values to variables representing package metadata. There are no functions, control flow, external calls, or data manipulation. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as metadata declarations without any malicious behavior or security concerns.",
