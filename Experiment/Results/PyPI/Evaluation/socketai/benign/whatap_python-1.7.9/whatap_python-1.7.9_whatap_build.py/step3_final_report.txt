  "purpose": "Static package metadata assignment defining app name, version, and release date.",
  "sources": "Variable assignments for 'app', 'name', 'version', and 'release_date'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; code does not process untrusted input or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; static assignments only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and metadata-only.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments representing package metadata. There are no dynamic behaviors, external inputs, network calls, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores as 0, with high confidence. The code does not contain any suspicious patterns or malicious intent. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and static nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign package metadata with no malicious or suspicious elements. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent. No further action is required.",
