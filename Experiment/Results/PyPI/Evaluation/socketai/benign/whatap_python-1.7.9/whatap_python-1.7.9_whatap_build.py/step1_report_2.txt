{
  "purpose": "The code defines basic metadata variables for a Python package or application, including app name, package name, version, and release date.",
  "sources": "The code reads from hardcoded string assignments at the beginning of the script.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data handling in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists beyond the initial assignment of constants; no source-to-sink flow is present.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments with no dynamic or suspicious behavior; no anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward and only assigns string literals to variables representing metadata. No external input, no data processing, no network activity, and no malicious code are present. It appears to be part of a larger script or configuration setup, not executable malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as static metadata definition without any malicious intent or security risks.",
