  "conclusion": "This is legitimate system monitoring code with no malicious intent. The network transmission is typical for such tools but warrants endpoint trust verification. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk is low (~0.2). The main improvement is fixing the typo and adding error handling if needed."
