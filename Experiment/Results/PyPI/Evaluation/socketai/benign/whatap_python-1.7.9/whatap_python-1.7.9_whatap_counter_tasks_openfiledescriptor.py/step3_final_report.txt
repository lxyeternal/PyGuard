  "purpose": "Monitor the current process's open file descriptors on Linux systems and transmit this data over the network for monitoring purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads process ID via os.getpid(), accesses /proc/{pid}/fd directory to count open file descriptors.",
  "sinks": "Uses whatap.io.DataOutputX to serialize data and async_sender.send_relaypack() to send data over the network.",
  "flows": "Collects current file descriptor count, packages data with process info, serializes, and transmits via network relay.",
  "anomalies": "Minor typo in 'fields' dictionary key ('currnet_nofile' instead of 'current_nofile'); no suspicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Linux system monitoring by counting open file descriptors via /proc. It packages this info with process ID and configuration parameters, then sends it asynchronously over the network. No malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The only concern is the trustworthiness of the network relay endpoint, which is outside the code scope. The typo in 'currnet_nofile' should be corrected for clarity. Error handling for missing /proc directory or network failures is minimal but acceptable for a monitoring task.",
  "conclusion": "This is legitimate system monitoring code with no malicious intent. The network transmission is typical for such tools but warrants endpoint trust verification. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk is low (~0.2). The main improvement is fixing the typo and adding error handling if needed.",
