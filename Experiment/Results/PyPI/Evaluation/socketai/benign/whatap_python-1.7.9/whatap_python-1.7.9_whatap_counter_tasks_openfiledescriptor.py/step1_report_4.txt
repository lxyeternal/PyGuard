  "purpose": "Monitor and report the number of open file descriptors for the current process at regular intervals.",
  "sources": "Reads process ID from os.getpid(), reads file descriptor directory listing from '/proc/{pid}/fd'.",
  "sinks": "Encodes data into a pack and sends it via async_sender.send_relaypack().",
  "flows": "Process ID -> File descriptor count -> Pack creation -> Data serialization -> Network relay send.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data flows observed. Use of '/proc' filesystem is typical for Linux systems. No unusual code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a task to monitor open file descriptors. It reads the process ID, counts open file descriptors, calculates percentage against soft limit, constructs a data pack, and sends it over the network asynchronously. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The data is used solely for resource monitoring. No external or untrusted input is directly involved beyond system information. The data transmission appears legitimate and related to monitoring. The code structure and behavior are standard for resource tracking utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate resource monitoring task with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It gathers system data and sends it via a known network function. No security risks or malware detected.",
