{
  "purpose": "Defines a set of integer constants representing various internal parameters or commands for use within a larger system.",
  "sources": "Class variable assignments serving as internal identifiers; no external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or output sinks; static constants do not process external data.",
  "flows": "N/A - static constant definitions; no data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static class with constant assignments, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a class containing numerous integer constants, serving as identifiers or parameters. It contains no functions, external data handling, or dynamic behavior. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code's purpose appears to be defining internal parameters for use elsewhere. Given this, there are no security issues, malware, or obfuscation concerns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static enumeration of parameters with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are justified and should be maintained as such.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
