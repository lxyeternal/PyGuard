{
  "purpose": "Define a set of constant parameter identifiers likely used for system or application commands and configurations.",
  "sources": "No direct data input sources; only class attributes with integer values are defined.",
  "sinks": "No evident data sinks, network calls, or data processing; this code does not handle external data directly.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data paths present, as it only defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed. The class solely contains constant definitions with no dynamic execution, no embedded code, and no obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class containing multiple class variables assigned to integer constants. These appear to be parameter or command identifiers used elsewhere in a larger system. There are no functions, no data processing, no external data handling, no hardcoded secrets, and no signs of malicious behavior. The structure and content are typical for configuration or command parameter definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign set of constant definitions used for referencing system or application parameters. There is no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, data leaks, or malicious behavior. It is a standard pattern for defining identifiers.",
