{
  "purpose": "Defines a class with a collection of constant integer parameters, likely for internal use within a larger system or application.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; all values are hardcoded constants.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs that handle untrusted input are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks, as the code only declares constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs detected. The code is straightforward and standard for defining constants.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple class definition containing multiple class variables assigned to integer constants. There are no functions, dynamic code execution, input handling, or external interactions. It appears to serve as a configuration or enumeration class. The absence of dynamic behavior or external data handling suggests low risk of malicious activity. No signs of backdoors, secret keys, or malicious obfuscation are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard constants class with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It likely functions as an internal enumeration for parameter identifiers within a larger application.",
