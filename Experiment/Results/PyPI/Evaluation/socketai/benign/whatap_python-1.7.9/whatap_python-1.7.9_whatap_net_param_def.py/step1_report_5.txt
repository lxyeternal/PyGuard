{
  "purpose": "Defines a set of constant parameter identifiers for internal use in an application or API.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading points; all are static class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external effects observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; this is purely a constants class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behavior. No dynamic code, obfuscated segments, or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The class `ParamDef` contains only static constant integer assignments representing parameter identifiers. No data input, no external communications, and no logic or control flow. It appears to be a straightforward enumeration or constants holder for API or internal command codes. No signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. The code is simple, static, and does not perform any operations beyond defining constants.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign constants class defining parameter IDs for an application. It shows no malicious intent, suspicious behaviors, or security risks. It appears to be a standard pattern for organizing constant values.",
