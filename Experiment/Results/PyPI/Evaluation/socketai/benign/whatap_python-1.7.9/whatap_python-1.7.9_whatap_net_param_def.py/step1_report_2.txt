{
  "purpose": "Defines a class containing various constant parameter identifiers likely used for inter-process communication or API calls within a larger system.",
  "sources": "Class attribute definitions; no data input or external sources involved.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output functions observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is purely a set of constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class defining numerous integer constants, presumably for internal reference purposes. There are no function calls, no external data handling, no input/output operations, and no dynamic or reflective code present. The structure and content are typical for configuration or parameter enumeration. The code does not include any suspicious or malicious logic, nor does it perform any actions beyond static constant definition.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign parameter class with no signs of malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks. It appears to be a standard component for system configuration or communication protocols.",
