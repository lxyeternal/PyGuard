{
  "purpose": "Defines a set of constant parameter identifiers for internal use in a larger system, likely for configuration or command signaling.",
  "sources": "None (the code only defines constants, no data input or external data reading).",
  "sinks": "None (no data processing, output, or untrusted data handling present).",
  "flows": "None (no data flow or execution flow involving external input or output).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code solely consists of constant definitions with no dynamic or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with numerous class variables assigned integer values, representing different parameters or commands. There is no input handling, data processing, or external communication. No malicious or suspicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors is evident. The structure appears to be a simple enumeration of constants for use elsewhere in the system. No obfuscation or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward parameter/constants class definition with no signs of malicious intent, security issues, or obfuscation. It appears to be part of a larger, benign system for managing or referencing operational parameters.",
