{
  "purpose": "This code demonstrates basic CRUD operations with Azure Key Vault using the azure-identity and azure-keyvault-keys SDKs. It creates, retrieves, updates, and deletes cryptographic keys in the vault.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable VAULT_URL for the key vault URL, and uses DefaultAzureCredential for authentication.",
  "sinks": "Uses Azure SDK methods to interact with Azure Key Vault; these are trusted APIs that handle sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Source (VAULT_URL env and DefaultAzureCredential) -> SDK API calls (create, get, update, delete keys) -> Azure Key Vault service.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network behavior are observed. The code does not perform any malicious actions, data exfiltration, or suspicious communications.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward example of managing cryptographic keys in Azure Key Vault, leveraging the SDK's asynchronous methods. It reads the vault URL from an environment variable and performs key creation, retrieval, update, and deletion operations. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code only interacts with trusted Azure SDK components, and all data flows are limited to Azure services.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate example for managing cryptographic keys using Azure SDKs. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. All operations are standard SDK calls with no suspicious patterns. The overall security risk is negligible.",
