  "purpose": "Demonstrates basic CRUD operations on Azure Key Vault keys using the azure SDK, environment variables, and async calls.",
  "sources": "Environment variable VAULT_URL, azure.identity.aio.DefaultAzureCredential, azure.keyvault.keys.aio.KeyClient methods",
  "sinks": "Azure Key Vault service via SDK API calls, network interactions with Azure endpoints",
  "flows": "Initialization of credentials and client -> creation of keys -> retrieval of keys -> update of key properties -> deletion of keys",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Azure SDK key management operations with proper credential handling and environment configuration. It uses async functions appropriately and follows best practices. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws are present. The environment variable VAULT_URL is used for configuration, and all SDK calls are legitimate. The code's purpose is educational or operational, not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure example of Azure Key Vault key management with no malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured, with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscated scores are zero.",
