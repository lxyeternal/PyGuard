  "purpose": "This script demonstrates the basic CRUD operations on Azure Key Vault keys, including creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting keys asynchronously.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable VAULT_URL for the key vault URL; uses azure.identity.aio.DefaultAzureCredential for authentication; calls methods on KeyClient to create, get, update, and delete keys.",
  "sinks": "Azure Key Vault SDK methods that perform key operations; no other data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Reads VAULT_URL from environment -> Authenticates via DefaultAzureCredential -> Performs key operations (create, get, update, delete) via KeyClient methods.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are observed. The code follows standard SDK usage patterns for Azure Key Vault.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of Azure Key Vault key management using the official SDK. It retrieves the vault URL from environment variables, authenticates with DefaultAzureCredential, and performs key creation, retrieval, update, and deletion asynchronously. All operations appear to be standard and aligned with Azure SDK best practices. No malicious or backdoor code, suspicious network activity, or hardcoded credentials are present. The code does not handle any user input beyond environment variables and performs expected key management tasks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate sample for managing Azure Key Vault keys, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It adheres to normal SDK usage and contains no suspicious or malicious code segments. Therefore, it is considered safe.",
