{
  "purpose": "This code demonstrates basic CRUD operations on Azure Key Vault keys using the azure-identity and azure-keyvault-keys SDKs, for managing cryptographic keys securely.",
  "sources": "Environment variable VAULT_URL, imported libraries (azure.identity.aio, azure.keyvault.keys.aio), and user input via environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Azure Key Vault API calls, credential initialization, and environment variable access which interact with external systems.",
  "flows": "The code reads the VAULT_URL environment variable to initialize credentials and client; then performs create, get, update, and delete operations on keys via Azure SDK functions, which communicate with Azure services over the network.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code patterns. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious network activity observed. The code uses standard Azure SDK operations for key management.",
  "analysis": "The script uses Azure SDKs for key management, following typical usage patterns for Azure Key Vault. It reads configuration from environment variables and performs standard cryptographic key operations—creating RSA and EC keys, updating metadata, and deleting keys. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The code interacts solely with Azure services and handles keys securely, following best practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Azure Key Vault sample demonstrating key management functionalities. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. It adheres to secure practices for cryptographic key operations using Azure SDKs.",
