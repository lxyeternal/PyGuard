{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates asynchronous CRUD operations on Azure Key Vault keys using azure-identity and azure-keyvault-keys libraries, including key creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable VAULT_URL for vault address; uses DefaultAzureCredential for authentication; accepts key names, key sizes, and key types as input parameters within function calls.",
  "sinks": "Calls to Azure SDK methods that perform key management operations (create, get, update, delete); no direct data sinks or network transmission of untrusted data; relies on Azure SDK for operations.",
  "flows": "Environment variable VAULT_URL -> Azure SDK credential and client initialization -> Key operations (create, get, update, delete) -> Output to console.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic; comments and code align with documented Azure SDK usage; environment variable usage is standard.",
  "analysis": "The script performs documented Azure Key Vault key management operations asynchronously using Azure SDKs. It reads configuration from environment variables, authenticates with Azure using DefaultAzureCredential, and performs key creation, retrieval, update, and deletion. There are no signs of malicious activities such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. No obfuscated code or suspicious behavior is present. The code is straightforward and aligns with typical usage patterns of Azure SDKs for key management.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate sample demonstrating Azure Key Vault key management operations. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this module. It functions as intended for secure key lifecycle management using Azure SDKs.",
