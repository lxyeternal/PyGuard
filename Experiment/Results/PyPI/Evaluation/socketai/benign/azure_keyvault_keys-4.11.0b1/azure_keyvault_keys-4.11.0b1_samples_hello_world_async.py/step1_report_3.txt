  "purpose": "This script demonstrates CRUD operations on Azure Key Vault keys, including creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion, using the azure-identity and azure-keyvault-keys libraries.",
  "sources": "Environment variable VAULT_URL for the vault URL, azure-identity's DefaultAzureCredential for authentication.",
  "sinks": "Azure Key Vault API calls (create_rsa_key, create_ec_key, get_key, update_key_properties, delete_key), which interact with cloud service.",
  "flows": "Credential initialization via DefaultAzureCredential, creating keys, retrieving keys, updating key properties, deleting keys.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior observed. The code adheres to standard usage patterns for Azure SDK operations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and Azure SDK modules, uses environment variables for configuration, and performs key management operations via Azure's official SDK. No signs of obfuscated code, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity. Operations are limited to cloud resource management without any direct data leaks or system modifications. The code properly manages credentials and closes connections. No embedded secrets or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate example of Azure Key Vault key management, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It follows recommended usage patterns for the SDK and does not perform any suspicious activities.",
