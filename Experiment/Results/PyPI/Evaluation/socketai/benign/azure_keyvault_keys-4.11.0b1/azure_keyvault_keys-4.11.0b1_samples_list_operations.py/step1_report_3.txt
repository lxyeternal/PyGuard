{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates how to interact with Azure Key Vault to create, list, update, and delete cryptographic keys using the Azure SDK for Python.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable VAULT_URL, imports from azure.identity and azure.keyvault.keys, and initializes credentials and client objects.",
  "sinks": "Uses the KeyClient methods to perform key operations; no direct sink for untrusted data or external output of sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Environment variable VAULT_URL is read -> credentials are initialized -> KeyClient interacts with Azure Key Vault -> key creation, listing, updating, deletion occur.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code. The code operates within the expected SDK functions for key management.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs standard key management tasks using Azure SDK: creating RSA and EC keys, listing keys and their properties, updating key sizes, listing key versions, and deleting keys. It relies on environment variables and SDK functions, with no evidence of malicious payloads or covert behaviors. No untrusted data inputs or dangerous data handling are present. The code follows typical usage patterns for the Azure Key Vault SDK, with clear comments and proper API calls. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, data exfiltration, or security bypasses. The overall functionality aligns with legitimate key management activities without suspicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate example of Azure Key Vault key management using the SDK. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a standard operational script for cryptographic key lifecycle management.",
