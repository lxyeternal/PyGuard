  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the details with the provided code, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward Azure Key Vault key management script.\n- It uses standard SDKs, environment variables, and SDK methods.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious API calls are present.\n- No signs of malicious activity, malware, or backdoors.\n- The logic is clear, with no anomalies or unusual behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n\n**Purpose & Analysis:**\n\n- Correctly states the code interacts with Azure Key Vault for key management.\n- No anomalies or suspicious code.\n- Proper use of SDK functions, environment variables, and credentials.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**\n\n- Malware: 0 — Correct.\n- Obfuscated: 0 — Correct.\n- Risk: 0.1 — Slightly above zero, but acceptable given it's a management script.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n\n**Purpose & Analysis:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, confirms legitimate key management.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n- Uses environment variables and SDK as intended.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**\n\n- Malware: 0 — Correct.\n- Obfuscated: 0 — Correct.\n- Risk: 0 — Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n\n**Purpose & Analysis:**\n\n- Same as above, confirms legitimate operations.\n- No anomalies or suspicious code.\n- Proper SDK usage and environment variable reliance.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**\n\n- Malware: 0 — Correct.\n- Obfuscated: 0 — Correct.\n- Risk: 0 — Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n\n**Purpose & Analysis:**\n\n- Similar findings, standard key management.\n- No anomalies, no suspicious code.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate code.\n\n**Scores:**\n\n- Malware: 0 — Correct.\n- Obfuscated: 0 — Correct.\n- Risk: 0 — Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n\n**Purpose & Analysis:**\n\n- Same as others, standard SDK-based key management.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious activity.\n- No malicious intent evident.\n\n**Scores:**\n\n- Malware: 0 — Correct.\n- Obfuscated: 0 — Correct.\n- Risk: 0 — Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- All reports consistently identify the code as legitimate, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The risk scores are minimal, reflecting the benign nature of the script.\n- The malware scores are all zero, which is justified given the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification & Personal Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — Code is clear, well-commented, and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — Slightly elevated due to the nature of key management, but acceptable.\n\n**Note:** The code itself is safe; the only potential concern is if it were misused in a malicious context, but as provided, it is a standard management script.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are reasonable. No adjustments needed.",
