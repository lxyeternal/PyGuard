{
  "purpose": "This code manages Azure Key Vault keys by creating, listing, updating, and deleting keys using the Azure SDK, with configuration via environment variables and DefaultAzureCredential.",
  "sources": "Environment variable VAULT_URL, SDK method calls (create_rsa_key, create_ec_key, list_properties_of_keys, get_key, list_properties_of_key_versions, begin_delete_key, list_deleted_keys).",
  "sinks": "SDK method responses, key management operations, no data exfiltration or network activity outside SDK calls.",
  "flows": "Reads VAULT_URL from environment -> authenticates with DefaultAzureCredential -> performs key operations via SDK methods -> outputs results.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, well-commented, uses standard SDK functions, no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs legitimate Azure Key Vault key management tasks, utilizing environment variables and SDK methods appropriately. No signs of obfuscation, malicious commands, or backdoors. The operations are standard and intended for secure key lifecycle management. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present. The code's structure and comments indicate clarity and correctness. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to the nature of key management, and the malware score is zero, reflecting no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for managing cryptographic keys in Azure Key Vault. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
