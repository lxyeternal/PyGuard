{
  "purpose": "This code demonstrates basic operations with Azure Key Vault using the azure-identity and azure-keyvault-keys libraries, including creating, listing, updating, and deleting cryptographic keys.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variable 'VAULT_URL' to determine the Key Vault URL; uses DefaultAzureCredential for authentication.",
  "sinks": "Calls to Azure Key Vault service through the KeyClient methods (create_rsa_key, create_ec_key, list_properties_of_keys, get_key, list_properties_of_key_versions, begin_delete_key, list_deleted_keys).",
  "flows": "Source: environment variable VAULT_URL and DefaultAzureCredential → KeyClient methods → Azure Key Vault service responses.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. The code uses standard SDK methods for Azure Key Vault operations. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code uses environment variables for configuration, which is standard practice. It performs predictable operations for key management—creating, listing, updating, and deleting keys via Azure SDK. There are no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, unauthorized network activity, or backdoors. The code functions as intended for key lifecycle management. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are detected. All interactions are with legitimate Azure SDK methods for managing cryptographic keys.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, legitimate demonstration of Azure Key Vault key management operations. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It solely interacts with Azure services for key lifecycle management, following standard SDK practices.",
