  "purpose": "The code manages Azure Key Vault keys by creating, listing, updating, and deleting keys using Azure SDK for Python.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable VAULT_URL for vault URL, and uses DefaultAzureCredential for authentication.",
  "sinks": "Calls Azure Key Vault API endpoints for key creation, listing, updating, and deletion.",
  "flows": "Retrieves VAULT_URL -> Authenticates with DefaultAzureCredential -> Performs key operations (create, list, update, delete) via Azure SDK methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious API calls, no unusual code patterns. The code appears to perform standard key management operations.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward demonstration of Azure Key Vault key management using the Azure SDK. It reads configuration from environment variables and uses standard SDK methods. No untrusted input is processed, no data is sent over the network outside the SDK, and no malicious behavior is evident. The code does not include any obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious API calls. It is purely for demonstration and management of cryptographic keys, with proper use of credentials and SDKs. No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Azure Key Vault key management script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs legitimate operations for managing cryptographic keys in Azure. No malware or malicious intent identified.",
