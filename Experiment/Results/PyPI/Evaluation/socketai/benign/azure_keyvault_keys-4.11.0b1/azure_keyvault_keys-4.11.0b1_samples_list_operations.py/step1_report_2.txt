{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates basic operations with Azure Key Vault, including creating, listing, updating, and deleting cryptographic keys using the Azure SDK for Python.",
  "sources": "Reads the environment variable VAULT_URL for the Key Vault URL; uses DefaultAzureCredential for authentication.",
  "sinks": "Calls to Azure Key Vault service methods (create_rsa_key, create_ec_key, list_properties_of_keys, get_key, create_rsa_key with size parameter, list_properties_of_key_versions, begin_delete_key, list_deleted_keys) that perform key management operations.",
  "flows": "The code flows from setting up credentials and environment variables, creating keys, listing keys and their versions, updating a key, and finally deleting keys. The flow involves reading environment data, performing API calls, and printing results.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious API usage. The code comments are detailed, and the code strictly performs documented Azure SDK key management functions.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, utilizing the Azure SDK for key management. It reads environment variables for configuration, authenticates with DefaultAzureCredential, and performs standard key operations without any obfuscation or suspicious logic. No malicious data handling, no suspicious network activity, and no hidden backdoors are present. All functions are related to legitimate Azure Key Vault management tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard example of Azure Key Vault operations for managing cryptographic keys. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks. It functions as intended for secure key management in Azure, with no evidence of sabotage or malware.",
