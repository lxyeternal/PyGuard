{
  "purpose": "This code interacts with Azure Key Vault to create, list, update, and delete cryptographic keys using the azure-identity and azure-keyvault-keys libraries.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable VAULT_URL for the vault URL, and utilizes DefaultAzureCredential for authentication.",
  "sinks": "Calls methods to create, get, list, and delete keys within the Azure Key Vault.",
  "flows": "Uses environment variable VAULT_URL to instantiate credentials -> creates and manages keys via client methods -> retrieves key properties and versions -> deletes keys.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or backdoors observed. The code relies on standard Azure SDK methods. No unusual dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or misleading variables.",
  "analysis": "The code performs legitimate Azure Key Vault operations: creating RSA and EC keys, listing keys and their types, updating key sizes, listing key versions, and deleting keys. It uses environment variables for configuration and standard SDK credentials. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful commands. The flow is typical for key management scripts, and no suspicious code anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Azure Key Vault key management script with no malicious intent. It uses accepted practices and SDKs for cryptographic key lifecycle management. There are no indications of malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling.",
