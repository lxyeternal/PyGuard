  "purpose": "The script demonstrates backup, deletion, purging, and restoration of an Azure Key Vault key using the Azure SDK for Python.",
  "sources": "Environment variable VAULT_URL for the vault URL, azure.identity.aio.DefaultAzureCredential for authentication, and Azure Key Vault SDK methods for key operations.",
  "sinks": "Azure Key Vault service calls for creating, backing up, deleting, purging, and restoring keys; no external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Source: VAULT_URL environment variable and credential instantiation -> Key Vault SDK methods (create_key, backup_key, delete_key, purge_deleted_key, restore_key_backup) -> Azure Key Vault service operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior. Usage of environment variables for configuration is standard for cloud SDKs. No hardcoded credentials or secrets; the code interacts only with Azure services as intended.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Azure SDK functions to manage keys in a Key Vault, following documented best practices. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present, and all operations are performed via official SDK calls. No malicious code, such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or data theft, is detected. The code’s purpose is for key management operations, which is legitimate in a cloud security context. The use of asyncio and environment variables aligns with common secure practices. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward demonstration of Azure Key Vault key management operations with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It follows standard practices for cloud credential management and SDK usage.",
