{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates how to perform backup, delete, purge, and restore operations on Azure Key Vault keys using the Azure SDK for Python.",
  "sources": "Environment variable VAULT_URL, imported modules (asyncio, os, azure.identity.aio, azure.keyvault.keys.aio)",
  "sinks": "Azure SDK API calls that interact with the key vault (create_key, backup_key, delete_key, purge_deleted_key, restore_key_backup)",
  "flows": "Reads VAULT_URL from environment variable -> uses DefaultAzureCredential -> performs key operations -> uploads, deletes, purges, restores keys via SDK calls",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; no unusual dynamic execution; all operations are standard SDK calls for key management.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes an Azure Key Vault client with credentials obtained via DefaultAzureCredential, which is a standard practice for cloud resource management. It creates, backs up, deletes, purges, and restores a key. All actions are performed via legitimate SDK functions, with no indications of malicious intent or obfuscated behavior. The use of environment variables and SDK APIs aligns with typical secure practices. No suspicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code's structure and comments are straightforward, with no hidden or malicious code fragments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate demonstration of Azure Key Vault key management operations using standard SDK functions. There are no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise. It is a typical, well-documented script for key backup and restore processes in cloud environments.",
