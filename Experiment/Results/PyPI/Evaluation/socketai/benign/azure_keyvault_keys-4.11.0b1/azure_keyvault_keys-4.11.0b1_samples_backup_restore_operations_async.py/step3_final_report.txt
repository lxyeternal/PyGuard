{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates Azure Key Vault key management operations including create, backup, delete, purge, and restore using the Azure SDK for Python.",
  "sources": "Environment variable VAULT_URL for vault URL; SDK functions for key operations; credential object for authentication.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or malicious network activity; standard SDK calls and environment variables used appropriately.",
  "flows": "Input from environment variable VAULT_URL flows into SDK client initialization; key operations (create, backup, delete, purge, restore) follow standard SDK methods; no suspicious data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, well-documented, with no obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The script performs legitimate key management tasks in Azure Key Vault using official SDKs and standard practices. It relies on environment variables for configuration, employs async functions correctly, and performs operations that are typical for key lifecycle management. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are present. The sleep delay after purge is a common pattern to ensure completion before restore. The code's purpose is clear and aligns with best practices. No logical errors or security flaws are evident. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting minimal operational delay and standard cloud credential handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard Azure Key Vault key management script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
