{
  "purpose": "This code demonstrates the use of Azure Key Vault SDK to create, backup, delete, purge, and restore cryptographic keys in an Azure Key Vault, primarily for management and operational purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variable VAULT_URL, and utilizes DefaultAzureCredential for authentication.",
  "sinks": "Data returned from backup_key, delete_key, purge_deleted_key, and restore_key_backup functions; console output (print statements).",
  "flows": "Environment variable VAULT_URL → instantiated KeyClient with credentials → create_key → backup_key → delete_key → purge_deleted_key → restore_key_backup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic present; use of standard Azure SDK functions.",
  "analysis": "The code securely interacts with Azure Key Vault using provided SDK methods. It handles key lifecycle operations without any suspicious or malicious patterns. There are no obfuscations, hidden code, or malicious network calls. The sleep delay is typical for ensuring state consistency. All input sources are environment variables, and outputs are merely console logs and SDK responses. No untrusted data processing or unsafe behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a legitimate sample script for managing Azure Key Vault keys. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The code performs standard key management operations with proper SDK usage. No signs of malware or security threats identified.",
