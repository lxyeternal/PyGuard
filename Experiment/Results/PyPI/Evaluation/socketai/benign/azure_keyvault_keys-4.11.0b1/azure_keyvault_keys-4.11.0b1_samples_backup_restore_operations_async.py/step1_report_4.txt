  "purpose": "Sample script demonstrating Azure Key Vault key management operations (create, backup, delete, purge, restore) using Azure SDK for Python.",
  "sources": "Environment variable VAULT_URL, os.environ, azure.identity.aio.DefaultAzureCredential, azure.keyvault.keys.aio.KeyClient methods",
  "sinks": "Azure Key Vault service calls (create_key, backup_key, delete_key, purge_deleted_key, restore_key_backup), asyncio.sleep",
  "flows": "Environment variable VAULT_URL -> KeyClient instantiation -> create_key -> backup_key -> delete_key -> purge_deleted_key -> sleep -> restore_key_backup",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior observed. Usage of environment variables and standard Azure SDK methods is typical.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Azure SDK modules and uses environment variables for configuration, which is standard. It performs sequential key management operations: creating, backing up, deleting, purging, and restoring a key. No data leaks, credential theft, or malicious actions are present. The sleep introduces a delay for purge completion, which is appropriate. No obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity, or hidden behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard example for Azure Key Vault key management with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It employs typical SDK calls and environment variable configurations without any anomalous or malicious code. The overall security posture is safe.",
