{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates Azure Key Vault key management operations such as creating, backing up, deleting, purging, and restoring keys using the azure SDK for Python.",
  "sources": "Environment variable VAULT_URL, imported modules (os, asyncio, azure.identity.aio, azure.keyvault.keys.aio)",
  "sinks": "Azure Key Vault service endpoints accessed via the KeyClient methods, credential management via DefaultAzureCredential",
  "flows": "Reads VAULT_URL from environment, uses DefaultAzureCredential for authentication, calls KeyClient methods to manage keys, with asynchronous flows for create, backup, delete, purge, and restore operations",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious API calls or network connections, no unusual or obfuscated code patterns, standard use of SDK functions",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard Azure SDK methods to perform key management operations. It retrieves the vault URL from environment variables, authenticates with DefaultAzureCredential, and executes key creation, backup, deletion, purge, and restoration. No data exfiltration, system manipulation, or malicious code patterns are present. The code primarily orchestrates API calls for key lifecycle management, with proper asynchronous handling. No anomalies like backdoors, suspicious network activity, or malicious logic are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate sample demonstrating Azure Key Vault key lifecycle management. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. All operations are standard SDK interactions with Azure services, and no indicators of sabotage or malicious intent are observed.",
