{
  "purpose": "This script demonstrates the creation, backup, deletion, purging, and restoration of an Azure Key Vault key using the azure SDK for Python.",
  "sources": "Environment variable VAULT_URL, input parameters for key creation, and SDK methods retrieving or handling key data",
  "sinks": "None of the data flow appears to leak sensitive data or lead to malicious effects; operations are confined to Azure Key Vault management",
  "flows": "Environment variable VAULT_URL is used to instantiate the client; key creation, backup, deletion, purge, and restore follow standard SDK calls with data from the environment and SDK responses",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hidden behaviors, or unusual code patterns observed; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; use of standard SDK functions and environment variables",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, leveraging Azure SDK for key management. It uses environment variables for configuration, performs standard key operations, and includes wait times for asynchronous operations. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious data handling are present. No obfuscation or suspicious network activity is evident. All actions are within expected SDK usage patterns and Azure best practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate Azure Key Vault management tasks without any malicious behavior or security risks. It adheres to best practices for handling cryptographic keys in Azure. No signs of malware or malicious intent are detected.",
