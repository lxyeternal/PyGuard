{
  "purpose": "This code demonstrates basic Azure Key Vault operations including creating, backing up, deleting, purging, and restoring a cryptographic key.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable VAULT_URL to determine the Key Vault URL; retrieves default Azure credentials via DefaultAzureCredential.",
  "sinks": "Uses Azure SDK methods to perform key management operations; no direct data output or network calls outside SDK; no apparent data leaks.",
  "flows": "Environment variable VAULT_URL -> DefaultAzureCredential -> KeyClient operations (create, backup, delete, purge, restore) -> Console print statements.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; code follows standard Azure SDK practices; no hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code securely interacts with Azure Key Vault using managed credentials and SDK functions. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. Operations are performed via SDK methods, which handle authentication and data security internally. No suspicious data exfiltration, network calls outside SDK, or malicious logic is evident. Sleep delays are used to wait for operations to complete, which is standard in such scripts. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward demonstration of key management without malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate Azure Key Vault operations without any malicious behavior or security issues. It does not contain suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious data handling. Overall, it appears safe and intended for educational or operational purposes.",
