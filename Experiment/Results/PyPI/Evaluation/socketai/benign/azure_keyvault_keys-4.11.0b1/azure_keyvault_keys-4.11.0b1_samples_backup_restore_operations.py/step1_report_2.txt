{
  "purpose": "This code manages Azure Key Vault keys by creating, backing up, deleting, purging, and restoring a key using Azure SDK for Python.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable VAULT_URL; uses DefaultAzureCredential for authentication; calls Azure Key Vault SDK methods for key operations.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive operations involving key management, but no insecure data handling or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Uses environment variable VAULT_URL as source; authenticates with DefaultAzureCredential; calls SDK methods for key operations as sinks, with data flow from SDK responses to print statements.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or unusual code patterns. Uses sleep to wait for key purge, which is standard practice. No obfuscated code or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code securely interacts with Azure Key Vault, using environment variables for configuration and standard SDK methods for key management. No suspicious data handling, no hardcoded secrets, and no malicious operations detected. The sleep call is normal for waiting on Azure operations; no backdoors or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This script performs standard Azure Key Vault key management operations with appropriate practices. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks within this code. It appears to be a legitimate administrative script for key management tasks.",
