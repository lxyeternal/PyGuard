{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates Azure Key Vault key management operations including creation, backup, deletion, purging, and restoration of a cryptographic key.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable VAULT_URL for the vault URL; uses azure-identity's DefaultAzureCredential for authentication; interacts with Azure Key Vault via KeyClient methods.",
  "sinks": "Calls Azure SDK methods that perform key management operations; no direct sinks for untrusted input data are present.",
  "flows": "Reads VAULT_URL -> Authenticates with DefaultAzureCredential -> Creates a key -> Backs up the key -> Deletes the key -> Purges the key -> Restores the key from backup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. Uses standard Azure SDK procedures. Sleep delay of 60 seconds is normal for Azure deletion propagation.",
  "analysis": "The code follows typical Azure SDK patterns for key management. It reads configuration from environment variables, uses standard authentication mechanisms, and performs legitimate key operations. No signs of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, hidden network activity, or backdoors, are evident. No suspicious code anomalies or obfuscated segments are present. All operations are documented and appear to be standard procedures for managing cryptographic keys.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward demonstration of Azure Key Vault key management tasks. It does not contain malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks. It solely performs legitimate operations using well-known SDK methods, with no indication of harmful intent.",
