{
  "purpose": "The code manages Azure Key Vault keys by creating, backing up, deleting, purging, and restoring a cryptographic key, primarily for key lifecycle management in cloud security.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable VAULT_URL to determine the Key Vault URL; uses DefaultAzureCredential for authentication.",
  "targets": "Uses Azure SDK methods to perform key operations which involve interaction with the cloud service, but no untrusted input directly affects system state or data.",
  "flows": "Environment variable VAULT_URL -> Azure SDK client calls -> Key Vault operations (create, backup, delete, purge, restore).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no suspicious network activity or data leaks; use of time.sleep(60) for waiting is benign but can be optimized; no obfuscated code or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard Azure Key Vault key lifecycle operations utilizing the Azure SDK. It uses environment variables for configuration and Azure identity for authentication, following recommended security practices. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The only notable aspect is the use of time.sleep for delay, which is standard in waiting for the key purge to complete, and not malicious. All SDK calls and variable usages are straightforward and serve legitimate key management functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation for managing Azure Key Vault keys with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It follows standard practices and does not contain any malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
