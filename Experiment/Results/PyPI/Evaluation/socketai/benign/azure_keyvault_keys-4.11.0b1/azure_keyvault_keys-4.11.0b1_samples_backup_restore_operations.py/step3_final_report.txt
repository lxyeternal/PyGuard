{
  "purpose": "Demonstrates basic Azure Key Vault key management operations: create, backup, delete, purge, and restore.",
  "sources": "Environment variable VAULT_URL, SDK methods (create_key, backup_key, begin_delete_key, purge_deleted_key, restore_key_backup), standard SDK credential handling.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks; operations are performed via SDK calls with environment-configured parameters.",
  "flows": "Input from environment variable VAULT_URL → SDK methods for key operations → no external data sinks or network activity beyond SDK calls.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual control flow. Use of time.sleep(60) is standard, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured example of Azure Key Vault key lifecycle management. It uses environment variables for configuration, SDK methods for operations, and standard practices. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security flaws are present. The use of sleep delays is typical for Azure operations. No obfuscation or suspicious activity detected. The security risk score is minimal, reflecting the sensitive nature of key management but without any vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure example of Azure Key Vault key management with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are accurate and justified based on the code's behavior.",
