  "purpose": "This script demonstrates creating, updating, rotating, and deleting an Azure Key Vault key using the azure-keyvault-keys SDK.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable VAULT_URL to obtain Key Vault URL; uses DefaultAzureCredential for authentication; calls Azure Key Vault API methods for key management.",
  "sinks": "Calls to Azure Key Vault API methods such as create_rsa_key, update_key_rotation_policy, get_key_rotation_policy, rotate_key, and begin_delete_key, which interact with external Azure services.",
  "flows": "Retrieves VAULT_URL -> Authenticates via DefaultAzureCredential -> Calls Azure Key Vault API methods to create, update, get policies, rotate, and delete keys.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious functions present; code solely performs standard key management operations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard operations for managing Azure Key Vault keys: creating keys, setting rotation policies, updating policies, rotating keys, and deleting keys. It relies on environment variables for configuration, uses well-established SDK functions, and contains no obfuscated or suspicious constructs. All API interactions are legitimate key management actions. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors are present. The script is straightforward, aligned with typical usage patterns for Azure key management, and does not include any malicious or covert behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate example of Azure Key Vault key management operations. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It operates solely within the scope of creating, updating, rotating, and deleting cryptographic keys using standard SDK calls. Overall, it is a safe and standard script for managing Azure keys.",
