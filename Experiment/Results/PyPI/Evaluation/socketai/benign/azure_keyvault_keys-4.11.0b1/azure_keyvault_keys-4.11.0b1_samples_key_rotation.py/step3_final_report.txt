{
  "purpose": "The code manages Azure Key Vault keys: creating, updating rotation policies, rotating, and deleting keys using Azure SDKs and environment variables.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable VAULT_URL; uses SDK functions from azure-identity and azure-keyvault-keys libraries.",
  "sinks": "Calls SDK methods for key creation, policy updates, rotation, and deletion; no external network or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Environment variable VAULT_URL → SDK client instantiation → key operations (create, update policy, rotate, delete).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Azure Key Vault key management tasks with clear SDK usage. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. It relies on environment variables and SDK functions as intended. No signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads. The security risk is minimal, justified by the sensitive nature of key management but is a common, controlled operation. Malware likelihood is zero, obfuscation is zero, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured Azure Key Vault key management script with no malicious intent or supply chain risks. The existing scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
