  "purpose": "Manage Azure Key Vault RSA keys, including creation, updating rotation policies, rotation, and deletion.",
  "sources": "Environment variable VAULT_URL for vault address; Azure SDK methods for key operations; os.environ for environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Azure SDK calls that interact with cloud services, possibly sensitive key management actions.",
  "flows": "Input from environment variables and SDK calls -> Key management operations (create, update policy, rotate, delete).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or backdoors. Use of Azure SDK for legitimate key management tasks. No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs legitimate Azure Key Vault key management tasks. It reads configuration from environment variables and uses official Azure SDKs to create, update, and delete keys, along with managing rotation policies. The code does not contain any code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious commands. There are no hardcoded credentials, secrets, or unusual behaviors. The operations performed are typical for key lifecycle management, with clear, documented procedures. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for managing Azure Key Vault keys and policies using Azure SDKs. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate sample for key rotation procedures with no suspicious elements.",
