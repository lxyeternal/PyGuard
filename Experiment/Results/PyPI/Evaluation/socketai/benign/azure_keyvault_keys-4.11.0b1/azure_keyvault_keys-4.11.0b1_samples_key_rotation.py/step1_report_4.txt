{
  "purpose": "This script manages Azure Key Vault keys, including creation, rotation policy management, rotation, and deletion.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable VAULT_URL; uses azure-identity DefaultAzureCredential for authentication; interacts with Azure Key Vault through azure.keyvault.keys library.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data is written or sent over the network, nor is any sensitive data exposed or leaked.",
  "flows": "Reads VAULT_URL from environment → authenticates with Azure via DefaultAzureCredential → performs key management operations → outputs status messages.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual code constructs; code primarily interacts with Azure SDK. No suspicious logic, obfuscation, or backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly uses environment variables for configuration, interacts with Azure SDK for key management, and performs standard operations such as creating, updating policies, rotating, and deleting keys. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors detected. It relies on established SDK functions with proper permission assumptions. No suspicious data flows or obfuscated code. Overall, it appears to be legitimate Azure key management code with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Azure Key Vault key management script, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It follows best practices by using environment variables and SDK functions. No malicious or sabotage elements are detected.",
