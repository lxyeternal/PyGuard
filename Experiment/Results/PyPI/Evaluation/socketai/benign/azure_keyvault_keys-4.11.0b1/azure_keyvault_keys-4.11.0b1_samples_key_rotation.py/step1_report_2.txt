  "purpose": "Manage Azure Key Vault keys, including creating, updating rotation policies, rotating, and deleting keys.",
  "sources": "Environment variable VAULT_URL; azure-identity's DefaultAzureCredential; azure.keyvault.keys methods for key creation, policy update, rotation, and deletion.",
  "sinks": "Azure Key Vault service endpoints for key management; no untrusted data flow evident.",
  "flows": "VAULT_URL read from environment variable → credential creation → KeyClient instantiation → key creation and policy updates → key rotation and deletion.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; all operations rely on environment variables and standard SDK methods. No suspicious code constructs or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script uses official Azure SDKs to manage cryptographic keys within Azure Key Vault. It involves environment-dependent configuration, credential management, key creation, policy updates, rotation, and deletion. The code does not include any data leaks, secret extraction, or network communication beyond Azure SDK calls. It performs expected key management functions without suspicious patterns. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code adheres to intended use of SDKs and configuration practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate Azure key management sample with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It uses standard SDK functions responsibly for key lifecycle management, with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks.",
