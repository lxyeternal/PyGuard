{
  "purpose": "The code manages Azure Key Vault keys, including creation, updating rotation policies, rotating keys, and deletion, primarily for automated key management and security.",
  "sources": "Environment variable VAULT_URL, Azure SDK methods (create_rsa_key, update_key_rotation_policy, get_key_rotation_policy, rotate_key, begin_delete_key), and credential provider DefaultAzureCredential.",
  "sinks": "Azure Key Vault service endpoints, Azure SDK internal methods, and potentially sensitive data such as key versions and policies.",
  "flows": "Environment variable VAULT_URL provides vault URL -> SDK methods invoke Azure Key Vault APIs -> key creation, policy updates, rotations, deletions; credential flows from environment to SDK.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious network activity; code adheres to standard Azure SDK practices. No unusual or obfuscated code detected; the code performs standard key management operations.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes Azure SDK to manage cryptographic keys securely via Azure Key Vault, following standard practices. No suspicious data flows or malicious code patterns observed. The use of environment variables and SDK methods aligns with typical cloud key management workflows. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious external calls. The operations performed—creating keys, setting rotation policies, rotating keys, and deleting—are standard security procedures for key lifecycle management. All actions require proper permissions and credentials, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of Azure Key Vault key management functions with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It correctly handles key lifecycle operations using secure SDK methods and environment configurations. No malware, malicious payloads, or suspicious anomalies detected.",
