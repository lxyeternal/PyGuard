{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates basic operations with Azure Key Vault, such as creating, listing, updating, and deleting cryptographic keys using the Azure SDK for Python.",
  "sources": "Reads the environment variable VAULT_URL; uses Azure identity credentials; interacts with Azure Key Vault via the KeyClient to perform key operations.",
  "sinks": "Calls to Azure Key Vault API to create, list, retrieve, update, and delete keys; no untrusted data outputs or external data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Uses environment variable VAULT_URL and Azure credentials as sources; performs operations on Azure Key Vault (create, list, update, delete keys); no malicious flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. The code follows standard Azure SDK usage patterns. No obfuscated code, unusual dynamic execution, or misleading variables identified.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward example of Azure Key Vault key management using async Python SDK. It utilizes environment variables for configuration and Azure SDK for interacting with cloud resources. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The code is well-documented and performs standard key management operations. No security risks are apparent within this module itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard example for managing Azure Key Vault keys. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or security issues. It is safe for use in an Azure environment, assuming the environment is configured correctly and securely.",
