{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates Azure Key Vault key management operations, including creating, listing, updating, and deleting keys using the Azure SDKs with async functions.",
  "sources": "Environment variable VAULT_URL, SDK method calls (DefaultAzureCredential, KeyClient), and console output.",
  "sinks": "Console output of key information; no data exfiltration or network activity beyond SDK interactions.",
  "flows": "Environment variable VAULT_URL → SDK credential initialization → SDK key management methods → Console output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard SDK functions for key management, with proper async handling and environment variable usage. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The code is a typical sample for educational or operational purposes, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security flaws.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign Azure Key Vault key management script. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
