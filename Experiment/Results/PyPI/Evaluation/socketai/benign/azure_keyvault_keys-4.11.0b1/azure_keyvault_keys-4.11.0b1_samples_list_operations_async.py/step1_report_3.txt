{
  "purpose": "This script demonstrates the usage of Azure Key Vault SDK for creating, listing, updating, and deleting cryptographic keys in an Azure Key Vault.",
  "sources": "Environment variable VAULT_URL, azure.identity.aio.DefaultAzureCredential(), Azure Key Vault client methods (create_rsa_key, create_ec_key, list_properties_of_keys, get_key, delete_key, list_deleted_keys).",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is directly written or sent over network, nor are there any dangerous system modifications.",
  "flows": "Environment variable VAULT_URL is used to initialize the vault URL; credentials are created via DefaultAzureCredential; key creation, listing, updating, and deletion are performed via client methods; data flows from environment variables and method calls, with data retrieved from the Azure Key Vault service.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code strictly adheres to SDK usage for legitimate key management tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code uses environment variables to obtain configuration data, employs Azure SDKs to manage cryptographic keys securely, and performs standard key management operations such as creation, listing, updating, and deletion. All operations are properly scoped and do not involve any suspicious or malicious activity. No data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful system modifications are evident. The only external interaction is with Azure services, consistent with its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate example of Azure Key Vault SDK usage for key management tasks. It does not contain malicious code or behaviors. Its purpose is to demonstrate standard cryptographic key operations without any malicious intent.",
