{
  "purpose": "The script demonstrates basic Azure Key Vault key management operations including creating, listing, updating, and deleting cryptographic keys using the Azure SDK for Python.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'VAULT_URL' for the Key Vault URL, and utilizes DefaultAzureCredential for authentication.",
  "sinks": "Calls to Azure SDK methods (create, list, get, delete keys) send requests over the network; no data leakage or untrusted data handling appears malicious.",
  "flows": "Environment variable VAULT_URL -> Azure SDK client calls for key operations; credential object authenticates requests, and responses are processed normally.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; code structure follows standard SDK usage patterns. No obfuscated code, no unusual behaviors, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward demonstration of Azure Key Vault key management, following recommended practices. It retrieves the vault URL from an environment variable, uses standard SDK methods, and properly manages resources with async context. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage. The operations are all documented, and the SDK calls are safe, secure, and expected in a legitimate key management script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for standard Azure Key Vault key management operations. No malicious activity, backdoors, or malicious data flows are detected.",
