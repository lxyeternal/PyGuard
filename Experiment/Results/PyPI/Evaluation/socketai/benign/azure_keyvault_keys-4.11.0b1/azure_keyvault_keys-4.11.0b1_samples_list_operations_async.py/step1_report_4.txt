{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates basic Azure Key Vault key management operations using the azure-identity and azure-keyvault-keys libraries in Python, including creating, listing, updating, and deleting keys.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable VAULT_URL to obtain the Key Vault URL, and utilizes DefaultAzureCredential for authentication.",
  "sinks": "Uses Azure SDK methods for key creation, listing, and deletion; no untrusted data output or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Source (VAULT_URL env variable and DefaultAzureCredential) -> KeyVault SDK calls (create, list, delete keys) -> Output printing of key information.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; code is straightforward and intended for legitimate key management. No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard, intended operations for managing Azure Key Vault keys: creating RSA and EC keys, listing keys and their properties, creating new key versions, and deleting keys. All operations are performed via Azure SDK calls with proper asynchronous handling. No malicious actions, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected. There are no signs of data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious network activity. The code is well-structured, with clear comments and no obfuscated segments. Overall, the code aligns with legitimate key management tasks without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate sample demonstrating Azure Key Vault key management via Python SDK. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified. The code performs expected operations without suspicious or harmful actions.",
