{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging the 'azure-keyvault-keys' Python library, configuring package metadata, dependencies, and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from '_version.py' file; reads README.md and CHANGELOG.md files for long description; reads environment variables and package data during setup.",
  "sinks": "Uses the version string from '_version.py'; potentially loads files from filesystem; no untrusted data sinks or external network calls observed.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from a local file, then passes data into the setup() function which configures the package; no external data flow or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The script performs standard package setup procedures without obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily imports standard modules, reads version info from a local file, reads markdown files for descriptions, and calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies. No external network calls, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious logic or data leaks are present. All data sources are local files or static strings, and the flow is straightforward. No anomalies or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python library with no signs of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks. It performs standard package configuration tasks securely and transparently.",
