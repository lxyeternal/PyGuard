  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Purpose & Functionality:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that this is a standard setup script for packaging the 'azure-keyvault-keys' Python library.\n   - The script reads version info from a local '_version.py' file, loads README and CHANGELOG files, and calls `setup()` with package metadata, dependencies, and package discovery configurations.\n   - No dynamic code execution, network calls, or untrusted data sources are involved.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - The code uses common patterns in Python packaging.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors are present.\n   - No obfuscation, code injection, or malicious logic detected.\n   - All data sources are static files or hardcoded strings.\n   - The regex used for version extraction is standard and safe.\n\n3. **Scores & Justification:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware score: 0.0\n     - Obfuscated score: 0.0\n     - Security risk: 0.0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - The confidence level is high (1.0), consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - No report suggests any hidden or malicious behavior.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no anomalies or suspicious constructs.\n   - The only possible concern could be the reliance on local files for version info, but this is standard practice and not inherently risky.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - Based on the code and reports, the risk is minimal.\n   - The code is clean, standard, and free of malicious activity.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 — No security risks identified.\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThe setup script is a typical, benign package configuration file with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All scores are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
