{
  "purpose": "This code is a standard Python setup script for packaging the 'azure-keyvault-keys' library. It reads version info from a local '_version.py' file, loads README and CHANGELOG files, and calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and package discovery configurations.",
  "sources": "Local files '_version.py', 'README.md', and 'CHANGELOG.md' for version and documentation; static strings for package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external network or dynamic code execution involved.",
  "flows": "Reading version from '_version.py' -> passing metadata to setup() -> package installation process.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; regex for version extraction is standard; no obfuscation or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical setup tasks for packaging a Python library, with static data sources and no dynamic or external inputs. It uses standard modules and patterns, with no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The version extraction via regex is a common approach, and all data is hardcoded or read from trusted local files. No network activity, code injection, or untrusted data handling is present. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and adheres to best practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals indicate a safe and legitimate package configuration. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis.",
