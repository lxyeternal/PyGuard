{
  "purpose": "This script sets up the packaging configuration for the 'azure-keyvault-keys' Python library, defining metadata, dependencies, and package inclusion rules.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from '_version.py' file; reads README.md and CHANGELOG.md files; reads environment variables (if any).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no data flows into external systems or sensitive data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from local file -> uses this info in setup() -> packages are configured for distribution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code present. No obfuscated or unusual code constructs detected. The only file read is version info and documentation files, which are typical in setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs standard package setup tasks: reading version info from a local file, reading documentation, and calling setuptools.setup() with appropriate parameters. No user input is taken, and no external network or system modifications are performed. The version extraction uses a regex on a local file, which is safe. The dependencies are standard, and no suspicious operations or data leaks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It contains no obfuscated code, malware, or suspicious data handling.",
