{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package called 'azure-keyvault-keys', including package metadata, version extraction, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading version from '_version.py', reading 'README.md' and 'CHANGELOG.md', environment variables (none used here), static strings for metadata.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function, which uses the gathered data to configure package installation; no untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Reading version and description files (source) to the setup configuration (sink), with static data used throughout.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup operations: reading version info from a file, loading markdown documentation, and configuring package metadata and dependencies. All data sources are static files or hardcoded strings, with no user input or untrusted data involved. No malicious behaviors such as network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration are present. The version extraction uses regex on a local file, which is common in package setups. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It reads static files and defines package metadata without involving untrusted data or executing any dynamic or external code. Overall, it appears safe and legitimate.",
