  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code is a standard Python package setup script.\n- It reads version info from a local '_version.py' file via regex.\n- It loads README.md and CHANGELOG.md for long description.\n- It uses setuptools to configure package metadata, dependencies, and package discovery.\n- No dynamic code execution, network calls, or untrusted data sources are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in the code?**  \n  No. The code performs typical setup tasks securely and transparently.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- **Logical or security flaws?**  \n  None detected. The approach to version extraction and package configuration is standard and safe.\n\n### Scores and Reasoning:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign 0.0, which is appropriate. The script does not perform any malicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0.0. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  All reports assign 0.0, which is reasonable given the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n### Potential Issues or Assumptions:\n- The only point to consider is the version extraction via regex. While common, if the '_version.py' file is maliciously altered, it could inject malicious code. However, in this context, it's a standard pattern, and there's no evidence of tampering.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a typical, well-structured setup script.\n- No external network activity, no dynamic code execution, no data leaks.\n- All data sources are local files or static strings.\n- No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n**Malware score:** 0.0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0.0  \n**Risk score:** 0.0\n\nThe current assessments are accurate. No modifications needed.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0 (no malicious activity observed)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.0 (no security risks detected)\n\n**Final note:** The script is a standard, safe setup script for packaging a Python library.",
