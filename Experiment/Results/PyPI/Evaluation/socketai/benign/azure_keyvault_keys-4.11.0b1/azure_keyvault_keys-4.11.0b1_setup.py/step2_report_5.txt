  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Anomalies:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the script is a standard setup.py for packaging a Python library.\n   - The code reads version info from a local file, loads documentation files, and calls `setup()` with static metadata and dependencies.\n   - No dynamic code execution, network calls, or untrusted data sources are present.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated/malicious code detected.\n   - The regex used for version extraction is standard and safe.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident in the code or the reports.\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment that the script is a typical, safe setup configuration.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - The confidence levels are high (1.0), appropriate given the straightforward nature of the script.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores seem reasonable.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Scores:**\n   - Since the code performs no malicious actions, the malware score remains at 0.\n   - The risk score, reflecting potential security issues, is also correctly set at 0.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, as there's no obfuscation or suspicious code.\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Final note:**\nThe code is a standard, safe setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The reports are accurate and consistent with my analysis.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The overall security assessment should remain at **malware: 0**, **obfuscated: 0**, **risk: 0**.",
