  "purpose": "This script is for setting up a Python package for the Azure Key Vault Keys client library, including extracting version info and configuring package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from '_version.py'; reading README.md and CHANGELOG.md files; obtaining package name and folder path; environment variables not used.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function writes package metadata and dependencies; no untrusted data outputs or network calls are present.",
  "flows": "Version extraction from '_version.py' feeds into setup configuration; package metadata is assembled from static files and variables.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The version extraction via regex is standard; no obfuscation detected. The code mainly reads static files and configures package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script reads version information from a local '_version.py' file using regex, which is a common pattern in Python packaging. It loads README and CHANGELOG files for long description. It then calls setup() from setuptools with package metadata, dependencies, and package discovery configuration. No network activity, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious imports or functions. The code appears to be a straightforward setup script for a Python package with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It reads static files and configuration data, then invokes the standard setup process. Overall, it appears safe and standard.",
