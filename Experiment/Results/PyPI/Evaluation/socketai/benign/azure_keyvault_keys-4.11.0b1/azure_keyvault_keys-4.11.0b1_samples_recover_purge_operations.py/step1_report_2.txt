{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates managing Azure Key Vault keys, including creating, deleting, recovering, and purging keys using Azure SDK for Python.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable VAULT_URL for vault URL, and uses azure-identity's DefaultAzureCredential for authentication.",
  "sinks": "Calls Azure SDK methods that perform key management operations, but does not write or transmit untrusted data externally.",
  "flows": "Environment variable VAULT_URL → Authentication credential → Key client operations (create, delete, recover, purge) → Azure Key Vault service.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious functions detected. The code adheres to typical Azure SDK usage patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script properly uses environment variables for configuration, employs standard Azure SDK methods for key management, and does not include any data exfiltration, network communication outside Azure, or hidden backdoors. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic detected. The code’s purpose aligns with legitimate key management tasks, with no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard Azure Key Vault management script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It performs legitimate key lifecycle operations securely, following best practices for credential management. No security risks or malware are evident.",
