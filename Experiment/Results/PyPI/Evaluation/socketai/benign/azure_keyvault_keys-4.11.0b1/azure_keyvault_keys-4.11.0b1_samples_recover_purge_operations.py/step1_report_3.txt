{
  "purpose": "This script manages Azure Key Vault keys by creating, deleting, recovering, and purging cryptographic keys using the Azure SDK for Python.",
  "sources": "Environment variable VAULT_URL for the Key Vault URL; SDK methods that interact with Azure Key Vault service",
  "sinks": "Azure Key Vault service endpoints for key operations; potentially sensitive key names and credentials",
  "flows": "VAULT_URL environment variable -> DefaultAzureCredential authentication -> KeyClient methods (create, delete, recover, purge) -> Azure Key Vault service endpoints",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; use of environment variable for sensitive URL; straightforward SDK calls; no suspicious or unusual code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code primarily initializes an Azure Key Vault client with credentials obtained via DefaultAzureCredential, which is a standard practice for Azure SDK authentication. It performs key creation, deletion, recovery, and purging operations on the specified vault. No user input is directly handled beyond environment variables. No data leakage, code injection, or malicious behaviors are observed. The code does not contain any obfuscated or suspicious constructs. All operations are legitimate management tasks intended for cryptographic key lifecycle management in Azure. The code's purpose is to automate key lifecycle management securely and transparently, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate example of Azure Key Vault key management using Python SDK, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on environment variables and Azure SDK conventions, which are standard for secure cloud operations.",
