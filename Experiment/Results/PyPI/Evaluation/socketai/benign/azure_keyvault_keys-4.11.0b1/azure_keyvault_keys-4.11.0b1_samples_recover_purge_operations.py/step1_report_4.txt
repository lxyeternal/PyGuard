{
  "purpose": "The code manages Azure Key Vault keys by creating, deleting, recovering, and purging cryptographic keys using the Azure SDK for Python.",
  "sources": "Reads the environment variable 'VAULT_URL' for the Key Vault URL; uses azure.identity.DefaultAzureCredential for authentication; calls Azure Key Vault API to create, delete, recover, and purge keys.",
  "sinks": "Uses Azure SDK methods to perform key operations; no direct untrusted data sinks or external communications that could be malicious.",
  "flows": "Reads VAULT_URL from environment -> Authenticates via DefaultAzureCredential -> Calls KeyClient methods to create/delete/recover/purge keys.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code follows standard Azure SDK usage patterns. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code flow observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward implementation of Azure Key Vault key management operations using the Azure SDK. It reads the vault URL from environment variables, which is standard practice. The script performs create, delete, recover, and purge operations without any obfuscated code or dynamic execution. There are no hardcoded secrets or credentials, and the operations align with typical key management workflows. The usage of SDK functions is secure and appropriate. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident in the code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a normal, intended use of the Azure SDK for managing cryptographic keys within an Azure Key Vault. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. It adheres to best practices for key management and environment configuration.",
