  "purpose": "This script demonstrates creating, deleting, recovering, and purging keys in an Azure Key Vault using the azure-sdk-for-python.",
  "sources": "Environment variable VAULT_URL; azure-identity's DefaultAzureCredential for authentication; calls to KeyClient methods for key management.",
  "sinks": "Calls to KeyClient methods such as create_rsa_key, create_ec_key, begin_delete_key, begin_recover_deleted_key, purge_deleted_key that interact with Azure Key Vault service.",
  "flows": "Authentication via DefaultAzureCredential -> Key management operations -> Deletion and recovery processes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; all sensitive operations depend on environment variables and Azure SDK; no obfuscated code or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward usage of Azure SDK to manage cryptographic keys in Azure Key Vault, with clear comments and no suspicious or malicious code patterns. The operations performed are standard key lifecycle actions and do not involve data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious activities. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present; all credentials are obtained via environment variables and managed Azure credentials. The logic flow is linear and consistent with intended key management procedures. No anomalies or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate example of Azure Key Vault key lifecycle management with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It securely manages keys using Azure SDK, relying on environment configurations. No malware or malicious behaviors are present.",
