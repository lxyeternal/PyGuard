{
  "purpose": "This code manages Azure Key Vault keys by creating, deleting, recovering, and purging keys using the azure SDK and environment variables for configuration.",
  "sources": "Environment variable VAULT_URL, azure.identity.DefaultAzureCredential(), and SDK method calls for key operations.",
  "sinks": "Azure Key Vault service endpoints where key management commands are executed; no untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input from environment variable VAULT_URL flows into SDK client initialization; SDK methods perform create, delete, recover, and purge operations on keys.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, well-commented, and uses standard SDK practices without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Azure Key Vault key management operations using official SDKs and environment variables. It does not contain hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. No suspicious network activity or data exfiltration is evident. The logic is clear, and the operations are typical for key lifecycle management. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's benign and legitimate purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent implementation of Azure Key Vault key management. It poses no security risks or malicious behavior. The scores and assessments in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
