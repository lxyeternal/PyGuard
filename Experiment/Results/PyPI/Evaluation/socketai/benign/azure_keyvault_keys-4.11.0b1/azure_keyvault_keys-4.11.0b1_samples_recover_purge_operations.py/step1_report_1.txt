{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates managing Azure Key Vault keys, including creation, deletion, recovery, and purging, using the azure-identity and azure-keyvault-keys libraries.",
  "sources": "Environment variable VAULT_URL for vault URL; user environment for DefaultAzureCredential configuration; Azure Key Vault service via azure SDK calls.",
  "sinks": "Azure Key Vault API calls that modify or delete keys.",
  "flows": "Credential setup from environment -> key creation -> key deletion -> key recovery -> key purging, with direct API calls for each step.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns or obfuscated logic; code mainly consists of standard SDK usage with clear API calls and comments. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code uses environment variables and Azure SDKs to manage cryptographic keys in Azure Key Vault. It follows standard procedures for creating, deleting, recovering, and purging keys with proper API calls. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or unauthorized system access. The code is straightforward, well-commented, and uses standard libraries and practices. No suspicious network activity or code injection observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate Azure Key Vault key management operations with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe to use based on this review.",
