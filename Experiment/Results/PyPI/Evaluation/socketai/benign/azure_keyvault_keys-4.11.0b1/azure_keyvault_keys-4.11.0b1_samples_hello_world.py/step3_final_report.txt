{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates standard Azure Key Vault key management operations including creating RSA and EC keys, retrieving, updating, and deleting them using the Azure SDK for Python.",
  "sources": "Environment variable VAULT_URL, SDK method calls (create_rsa_key, create_ec_key, get_key, update_key_properties, begin_delete_key)",
  "sinks": "SDK calls to Azure Key Vault service; no untrusted data sinks or data leaks detected",
  "flows": "Environment variable VAULT_URL and SDK method calls serve as sources; key management operations are performed as sinks; data flows from environment/config to SDK calls",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns observed; code is straightforward and well-structured",
  "analysis": "The code performs legitimate key management tasks using the Azure SDK, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic. It relies on environment variables and standard SDK practices. No untrusted input is processed directly, and no network activity beyond SDK calls occurs. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign, standard nature of the code. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured example of Azure Key Vault key management. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
