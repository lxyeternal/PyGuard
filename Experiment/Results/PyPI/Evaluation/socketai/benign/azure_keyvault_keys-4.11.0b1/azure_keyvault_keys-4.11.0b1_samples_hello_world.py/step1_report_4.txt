{
  "purpose": "This code demonstrates basic CRUD operations on Azure Key Vault keys using the Azure SDK for Python, including creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting cryptographic keys.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable VAULT_URL to obtain the Key Vault URL.",
  "sinks": "Uses the Azure SDK to perform key operations; no direct sinks for untrusted data identified.",
  "flows": "Environment variable VAULT_URL (source) is used in initializing the KeyClient, which then performs key creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion (sinks). No data flows to external systems or untrusted outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious data handling, or unusual code structures. The code comments are instructive and do not include secrets. Uses standard Azure SDK functions without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up an Azure Key Vault client using environment variables and DefaultAzureCredential, performs key creation (RSA and EC), retrieves a key, updates key properties, and deletes keys. All operations are standard SDK usage for managing cryptographic keys in Azure Key Vault. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are visible; credentials are managed via environment variables and default Azure SDK mechanisms. The code is well-structured and clearly documented, with no obfuscated or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate example of using Azure SDK for Python to manage keys in Azure Key Vault. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks and appears to be a standard, educational sample. No malware indicators are present.",
