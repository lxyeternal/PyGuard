  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a straightforward, standard implementation of Azure Key Vault key management using the Azure SDK for Python.\n- No report mentions any suspicious data input, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious network activity.\n- The code relies on environment variables and the DefaultAzureCredential, which are standard and secure practices.\n- The operations performed (create, get, update, delete keys) are typical for key lifecycle management.\n- No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent is presented or implied.\n- The confidence levels are high, and the analyses uniformly conclude the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Logical Checks:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code matches the described functionality; it creates RSA and EC keys, retrieves, updates, and deletes them. No anomalies or errors are apparent.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None are evident; the code does not process untrusted input directly, nor does it handle secrets insecurely.\n- **Malware or malicious behavior:** None detected. The malware score is consistently 0, aligning with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code is present; obfuscated score is 0.\n\n---\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low (0.1 or 0), reflecting minimal security risk—mainly the general risks associated with cloud key management, not malicious code.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and align with the code's content.\n- No adjustments are necessary; the assessments are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Systematic Estimate:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1 (or 0, if considering the minimal inherent risk of cloud key management)  \n\n**Rationale:**  \n- The code is a standard, well-documented example of using Azure SDKs for key management.  \n- No malicious or suspicious activity is present.  \n- The environment variables and SDK credentials are used securely.  \n- No obfuscation or hidden payloads are detected.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks beyond the normal considerations of cloud key management. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no further changes are necessary.\n\n**Final verdict:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (or 0 for minimal risk)",
