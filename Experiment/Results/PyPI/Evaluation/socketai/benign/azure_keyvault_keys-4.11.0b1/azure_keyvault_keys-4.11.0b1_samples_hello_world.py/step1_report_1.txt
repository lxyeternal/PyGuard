{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates basic CRUD operations on Azure Key Vault keys using the azure-sdk-for-python, including creating RSA and EC keys, retrieving, updating, and deleting keys.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable VAULT_URL, and uses azure-identity's DefaultAzureCredential for authentication.",
  "sinks": "Calls methods on the KeyClient to perform key operations, which do not involve handling untrusted input directly.",
  "flows": "Environment variable VAULT_URL → KeyClient initialization → create_rsa_key/create_ec_key → get_key → update_key_properties → begin_delete_key",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or sensitive data; no obfuscated code; no suspicious network activity or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard operations with the Azure Key Vault SDK for key management. It relies on environment variables and SDK credentials, which are common and not inherently suspicious. No untrusted data sources or external inputs are processed directly by the code. The operations are typical for key lifecycle management and do not contain any malicious logic. There is no evidence of malware or malicious intent. The code structure and comments indicate a straightforward use of the SDK without obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate example of Azure Key Vault key management operations. It does not contain malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The overall security risk is minimal, and there are no anomalies suggesting malicious intent.",
