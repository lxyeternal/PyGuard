{
  "purpose": "Sample script demonstrating CRUD operations with Azure Key Vault for key management",
  "sources": "Environment variable VAULT_URL, imported libraries (azure-identity, azure.keyvault.keys), user input through environment variables",
  "sinks": "Calls to Azure Key Vault service via the client methods (create, get, update, delete keys)",
  "flows": "Initialization of credentials -> creation of key client -> creation of RSA and EC keys -> retrieval and update of keys -> deletion of keys",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets, no suspicious network calls or data leaks, no obfuscated code or hidden logic; code performs standard SDK operations",
  "analysis": "The code initializes credentials via DefaultAzureCredential and performs key management operations with Azure SDK. It only uses environment variables and SDK functions to manage keys, with no untrusted data inputs, no network communication outside SDK calls, and no suspicious data handling. The code is well-structured, straightforward, and follows standard practices. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code injections. The code’s purpose is clearly to demonstrate secure key management operations.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard example for managing Azure Key Vault keys with no malicious intent or malicious behavior detected. It solely performs legitimate key management functions using official SDKs. No indicators of malware or security risks were found.",
