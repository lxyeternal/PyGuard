{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates basic CRUD operations for Azure Key Vault keys using the azure-identity and azure-keyvault-keys libraries, including creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting cryptographic keys.",
  "sources": "Environment variable VAULT_URL for vault URL; user input indirectly via environment variables and function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Azure Key Vault service calls (create, get, update, delete keys), print statements for output.",
  "flows": "Environment variable VAULT_URL → KeyClient initialization → create_rsa_key / create_ec_key → get_key → update_key_properties → begin_delete_key.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious dynamic code, obfuscation, or hidden logic detected. Use of environment variable VAULT_URL is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The script performs legitimate operations related to Azure Key Vault key management. It uses the azure SDKs correctly, with credentials obtained through DefaultAzureCredential, which is a secure and standard approach. There are no indications of malicious code such as data exfiltration, network communication outside of Azure SDK calls, or backdoors. The code interacts with the cloud service to manage cryptographic keys, which aligns with intended functionality. All data flows appear to be standard SDK interactions with Azure services, with no suspicious or malicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate example of Azure Key Vault key management operations with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It securely uses environment variables and standard SDKs without any suspicious logic or payloads.",
