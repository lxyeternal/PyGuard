  "purpose": "This code demonstrates CRUD operations on Azure Key Vault keys, including creation, retrieval, update, and deletion of RSA and EC keys.",
  "sources": "Environment variable VAULT_URL, os.environ['VAULT_URL'], default credentials via DefaultAzureCredential",
  "sinks": "Azure Key Vault via KeyClient methods (create_rsa_key, create_ec_key, get_key, update_key_properties, begin_delete_key)",
  "flows": "Input from environment variable -> DefaultAzureCredential -> KeyClient methods for key management operations",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. The code uses standard SDK calls for legitimate key management tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward example of using Azure SDK for Python to perform key management in Azure Key Vault. It sets up credentials securely via environment variables and standard Azure SDK classes. All operations are typical API calls with no unusual or risky logic. No obfuscated code, no suspicious data flows, and no embedded malicious payloads are present. The code does not perform any network communications beyond standard SDK operations, nor does it handle sensitive data improperly. There are no signs of malware or security risks within the provided code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate sample for managing Azure Key Vault keys, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It employs standard SDK methods and best practices without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
