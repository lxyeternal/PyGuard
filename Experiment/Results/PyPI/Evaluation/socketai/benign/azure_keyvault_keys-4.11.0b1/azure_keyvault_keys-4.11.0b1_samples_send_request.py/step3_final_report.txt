  "purpose": "Demonstrates Azure Key Vault key creation, retrieval via send_request, and deletion using the Azure SDK.",
  "sources": "Environment variable VAULT_URL, SDK methods (create_rsa_key, send_request, begin_delete_key)",
  "sinks": "HTTP request to retrieve key info via send_request",
  "flows": "Environment variable VAULT_URL -> SDK methods -> HTTP request to Azure Key Vault -> response processing",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and uses documented SDK features",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of Azure SDK for key management, performing create, retrieve, and delete operations. It uses environment variables for configuration, employs the send_request method for custom HTTP requests, and handles responses appropriately. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity are present. The use of send_request is within SDK documentation and intended for flexibility. The code does not exhibit malicious behavior or vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard example of Azure Key Vault SDK usage with no malicious intent or security issues. The low malware and risk scores are appropriate and justified.",
