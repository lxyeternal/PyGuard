  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-reference with the provided code.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard, legitimate use of Azure SDK for key management.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity are detected.\n- The use of `send_request` is documented as a flexible API feature, not inherently malicious.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- The code appears clean, with no evident vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n- The only potential concern is that the `send_request` method is used to make a GET request to fetch key details, which is standard for such SDKs. No malicious payloads or obfuscation are present.\n- The key URL is constructed directly from the SDK's properties, which is standard practice and not suspicious.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in the report's reasoning:\n- The reports correctly identify the code as safe and legitimate.\n- The risk scores assigned (mostly 0.1 or 0.2) are appropriate given the benign nature.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is consistent.\n- Security risk scores are low (~0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal concern.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9–1), indicating strong agreement on safety.\n\n### Justification for risk and malware scores:\n- Since no malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are detected, the malware score should remain at 0.\n- The risk score of around 0.1–0.2 is reasonable, considering this is a sample code demonstrating SDK usage, not production or untrusted input.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The use of environment variables and SDK methods aligns with best practices.\n- The custom `send_request` is used as intended, with no evidence of misuse.\n- No indication of supply chain attack or malicious payloads.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation present)  \n**Risk score:** **0.1** (very low, standard SDK usage)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward, well-structured example of Azure Key Vault SDK usage. No malicious, obfuscated, or high-risk elements are present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1\n\nThis reflects a very low security concern, consistent with the detailed analysis.",
