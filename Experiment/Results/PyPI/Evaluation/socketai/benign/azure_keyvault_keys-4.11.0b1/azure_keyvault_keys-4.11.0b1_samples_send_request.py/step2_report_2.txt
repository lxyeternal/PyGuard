  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard, legitimate example of Azure Key Vault interaction.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity are detected.\n- The use of `send_request` is consistent with SDK documentation and intended for custom HTTP requests.\n- The code performs create, retrieve, and delete operations in a typical manner.\n- No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or supply chain attacks are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code correctness:** The code matches the described logic and operations.\n- **Malware presence:** All reports assign malware score = 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated code:** All reports assign obfuscated = 0.\n- **Security risk:** The scores are very low (0.1–0.2), consistent with a benign sample.\n\n### Potential issues or flaws:\n- **Use of `send_request`:** While legitimate, this method can be exploited if misused, but in this context, it appears standard.\n- **Exposing key URL in logs:** The code prints key IDs, which could be sensitive, but this is typical for debugging and not malicious.\n- **Environment variable reliance:** Proper environment setup is assumed; no issues here.\n\n### Score assessments:\n- The scores for malware, obfuscated, and risk are reasonable given the analysis.\n- The high confidence levels (0.9–1.0) are justified due to the clear, standard SDK usage and lack of suspicious activity.\n\n### Justifications for higher scores:\n- None of the reports justify increasing the malware score above 0, as there's no malicious behavior.\n- The security risk remains low because the code interacts with Azure Key Vault in a standard, controlled manner.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation present.  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal security risk, typical for demonstration code.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a typical, safe example of Azure SDK usage, with no evidence of malicious intent or supply chain compromise.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Keep malware and obfuscated scores at 0.\n- Maintain a very low security risk score (~0.1).\n- The confidence level can remain high (~0.9–1.0).\n\nThis aligns with the overall assessment that the code is benign and intended for legitimate use.",
