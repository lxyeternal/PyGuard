  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the presence of issues, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward demonstration of Azure Key Vault SDK usage.\n- It performs key creation, retrieval via a custom `send_request`, and deletion.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity are detected.\n- The use of `send_request` aligns with SDK capabilities and is used for flexibility, not malicious purposes.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code, assigning very low security risk and malware scores.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Issue Checks:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears syntactically correct and aligns with Azure SDK usage patterns.\n- **Malicious activity:** No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Supply chain concerns:** No external dependencies or code modifications that could introduce malicious behavior.\n- **Sensitive data exposure:** No hardcoded secrets; environment variables are used appropriately.\n- **Network activity:** All network interactions are through Azure SDK, which is standard and expected.\n\n---\n\n### Logical flaws or reasoning issues:\n\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is standard and safe.\n- The only minor point is that the `send_request` method is used to make a GET request to retrieve key info, which is a legitimate SDK feature. The reports do not overstate or misinterpret this.\n\n### Scores and justification:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Security risk score:** Very low (0.1-0.2), justified given the benign nature and standard SDK usage.\n\n---\n\n### Any recommendations for score adjustments?\n\n- The scores seem reasonable and aligned with the analysis.\n- Given the absence of any malicious or suspicious activity, no upward adjustment is necessary.\n- The high confidence scores (mostly 0.9-1.0) are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Overall malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (consistent with minimal risk)\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (since it's a demonstration script with no security concerns)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The code is safe, standard, and does not pose any security threat. The scores are appropriate and should remain as they are.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware and obfuscated scores at 0.  \n- Maintain the risk score around 0.1–0.2, reflecting the low security risk of a demonstration script.",
