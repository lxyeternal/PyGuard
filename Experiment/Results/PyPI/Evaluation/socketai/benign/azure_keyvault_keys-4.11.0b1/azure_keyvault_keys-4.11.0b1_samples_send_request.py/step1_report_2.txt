{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates how to create, retrieve, and delete an Azure Key Vault key using Azure SDK for Python, including making custom HTTP requests with `send_request`.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable VAULT_URL for the key vault URL; uses Azure credentials via DefaultAzureCredential for authentication.",
  "sinks": "Uses Azure SDK methods that internally handle network communication and key management operations.",
  "flows": "Environment variable VAULT_URL → credential setup → client creation → create key → send_request to get key → delete key.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no unusual code patterns; code follows standard SDK usage; no obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code properly utilizes Azure SDK for key management, with no indication of malicious intent. It reads input (VAULT_URL) from environment variables and performs standard API calls. The `send_request` method is used as intended for custom HTTP requests; no suspicious request URLs or payloads are present. There are no signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The code is well-structured and primarily for demonstration purposes, with no anomalies or malicious artifacts detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard example of using Azure SDK for key vault operations, with no malicious or security-compromising behavior. It appears safe and intended for legitimate key management tasks.",
