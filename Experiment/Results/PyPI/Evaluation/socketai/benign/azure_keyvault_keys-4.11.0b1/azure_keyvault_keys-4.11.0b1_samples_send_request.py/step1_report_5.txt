{
  "purpose": "The code is a sample script demonstrating how to interact with Azure Key Vault using the azure SDK for Python, including creating, retrieving, and deleting a cryptographic key.",
  "sources": "Environment variable VAULT_URL for the vault URL; azure SDK methods for key management; user input indirectly via environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Azure Key Vault REST API calls through `send_request`; potentially sensitive data in HTTP responses.",
  "flows": "Environment variable VAULT_URL → DefaultAzureCredential & KeyClient instantiation → create_rsa_key → send_request for key retrieval → begin_delete_key",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials; use of environment variable for vault URL; no suspicious dynamic code or obfuscated code; no malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script securely interacts with Azure Key Vault using standard SDK methods. It creates a key, retrieves it via a controlled HTTP request, and deletes it. All operations utilize Azure's SDK and environment variables, avoiding hardcoded secrets. No untrusted data is processed, and there are no signs of malicious activity or backdoors. The use of `send_request` for custom HTTP requests is a legitimate feature, not indicative of malicious intent. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or reverse shells, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard example demonstrating Azure Key Vault SDK usage. It performs legitimate key management operations with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
