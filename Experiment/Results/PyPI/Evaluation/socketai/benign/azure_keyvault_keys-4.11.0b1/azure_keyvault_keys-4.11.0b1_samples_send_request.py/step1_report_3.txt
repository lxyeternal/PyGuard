{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates the creation, retrieval, and deletion of an Azure Key Vault RSA key using the azure SDK, including custom HTTP request handling.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable VAULT_URL for vault endpoint; uses azure-identity's DefaultAzureCredential for authentication; calls KeyClient methods for key management; constructs HttpRequest for custom API call.",
  "sinks": "Makes a GET request to retrieve a key; potentially exposes key URL via the request; outputs key ID to console.",
  "flows": "Environment variable VAULT_URL -> DefaultAzureCredential -> KeyClient methods (create_rsa_key, send_request, begin_delete_key) -> Custom HttpRequest -> response.json() -> console output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors. Uses standard SDK methods for key management. The custom request does not seem to manipulate or leak data maliciously.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes Azure SDK clients with environment variables and default credentials, performs key creation, retrieves the key using a custom HTTP request, and then deletes the key. All operations align with typical usage patterns for Azure Key Vault SDK. No signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity are present. The custom request uses the SDK as intended and does not contain obfuscated or malicious payloads. The only potential concern is that the custom GET request exposes the key URL, but this is standard for management operations and does not suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs legitimate key management operations using the Azure SDK without evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It adheres to typical SDK usage patterns and contains no malicious or suspicious code. It is safe based on the provided code.",
