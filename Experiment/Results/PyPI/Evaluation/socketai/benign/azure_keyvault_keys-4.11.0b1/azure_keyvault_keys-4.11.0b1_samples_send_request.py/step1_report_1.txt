  "purpose": "The code demonstrates how to interact with Azure Key Vault to create, retrieve, and delete cryptographic keys using the azure SDK for Python.",
  "sources": "Environment variable VAULT_URL for the vault endpoint; Azure credentials via DefaultAzureCredential for authentication.",
  "sinks": "send_request method to send HTTP GET request to fetch key details.",
  "flows": "Environment variable VAULT_URL -> KeyClient instantiation -> create_rsa_key -> send_request with constructed URL -> response.json()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; standard use of Azure SDK; no obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution; no suspicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes credentials and creates a key client for Azure Key Vault. It creates an RSA key, then constructs a custom HttpRequest to retrieve key details via send_request, and finally deletes the key. All operations are performed through Azure SDK methods with appropriate parameters. No user input, untrusted data, or external network activity outside the SDK context. No suspicious code patterns or backdoors are present. The code follows typical SDK usage patterns and is unlikely to contain malicious behavior or supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-documented example of interacting with Azure Key Vault using the Python SDK. It does not contain malicious behavior, supply chain risks, or security concerns. The overall security risk is minimal.",
