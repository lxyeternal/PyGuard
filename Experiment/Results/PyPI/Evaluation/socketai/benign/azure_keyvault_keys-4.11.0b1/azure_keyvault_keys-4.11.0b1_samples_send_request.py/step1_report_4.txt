{
  "purpose": "This code interacts with Azure Key Vault to create, retrieve, and delete cryptographic keys, primarily demonstrating the use of the `send_request` method for custom HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable VAULT_URL; uses Azure SDK's DefaultAzureCredential for authentication; reads key name and version for API requests.",
  "sinks": "Uses the `send_request` method to make HTTP GET request to fetch key data; outputs response data.",
  "flows": "Environment variable VAULT_URL -> Credential initialization -> Key client creation -> Create key -> Send custom HTTP request to fetch key -> Delete key.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials; no suspicious or unusual code patterns; no obfuscated code; no malicious API calls or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard operations for managing Azure Key Vault keys: creating, retrieving via a custom HTTP request, and deleting keys. It uses environment variables and Azure SDK libraries in a typical manner. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The use of `send_request` is explicitly documented as a flexible API method, not indicative of malicious intent. The code does not access or leak sensitive data beyond necessary key management operations, nor does it contain obfuscated or suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate example of Azure Key Vault key management using Python SDK. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or malware. The overall security risk is very low, and it appears safe for use within its intended purpose.",
