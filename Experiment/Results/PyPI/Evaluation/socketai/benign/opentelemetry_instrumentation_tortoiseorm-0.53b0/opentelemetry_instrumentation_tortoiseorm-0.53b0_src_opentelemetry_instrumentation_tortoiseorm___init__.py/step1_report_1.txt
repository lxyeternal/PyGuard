{
  "purpose": "Instrument Tortoise-ORM to report SQL queries and integrate with OpenTelemetry for tracing.",
  "sources": "Code imports modules and functions; wraps functions in Tortoise ORM clients; reads connection attributes and query parameters.",
  "sinks": "Uses untrusted data (queries, parameters, connection info) in span attributes; potentially exposes sensitive info in telemetry data.",
  "flows": "Function wrappers intercept ORM methods; extract query info and connection details; pass data to tracing spans; potentially include query parameters if enabled.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code detected. Use of wrapt to instrument functions is standard for monitoring. No suspicious external network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides instrumentation for database query tracing, capturing query details, connection info, and optional parameters. It uses standard libraries and practices for OpenTelemetry instrumentation. No code injection, malicious network activity, or data theft mechanisms are present. The focus is on monitoring and reporting, with configurable capture of parameters. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic detected. Implementation appears standard for observability purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate instrumentation module for Tortoise-ORM, designed for monitoring and telemetry. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior, but it does handle potentially sensitive query parameters which could pose privacy concerns if misused. Overall, it appears to be safe and intended for observability.",
