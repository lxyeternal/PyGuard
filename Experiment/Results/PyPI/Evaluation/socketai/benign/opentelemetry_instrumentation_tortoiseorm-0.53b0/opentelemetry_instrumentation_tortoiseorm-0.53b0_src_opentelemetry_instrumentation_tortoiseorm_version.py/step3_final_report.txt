{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a license header and version declaration for the open-source project, providing licensing information and versioning metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it contains only comments and a static variable assignment (__version__ = \"0.53b0\").",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or system effects, as the code is purely declarative.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code does not process or transmit data dynamically.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and standard boilerplate.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of license comments and a version string assignment, with no executable logic, data processing, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the code's static and informational nature. The confidence score is 1, reflecting certainty about its benign and straightforward nature. No adjustments are necessary as the code is entirely benign and the assessments are accurate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard license header and version declaration with no security concerns. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action or score adjustments are needed.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
