  "purpose": "This code snippet appears to be part of a license header and version declaration for an open-source project, specifically OpenTelemetry.",
  "sources": "The license comments and the __version__ variable assignment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources are present; the code is purely declarative.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or processing logic involving external input or untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. The license comments are standard boilerplate, and the version assignment is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is solely composed of license information comments and a version string assignment. It does not include any executable logic, input handling, or data processing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The structure is typical for open-source project headers.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and standard for open-source licensing and versioning. No malicious intent or security risks are present.",
