  "purpose": "The code appears to define the version information for a software package, specifically related to OpenTelemetry.",
  "sources": "The source is the assignment of the __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or could cause data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward assignment from a string to a variable, with no data input or output operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only license comments and a version assignment, with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, well-structured header defining licensing and version info. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, and no data handling that could lead to vulnerabilities. It is a standard boilerplate license and version declaration, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as metadata for the package. No malicious intent, security risks, or anomalies are present.",
