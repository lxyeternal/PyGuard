  "purpose": "Declare a tuple of instrument package dependencies, specifically for 'tortoise-orm' version 0.17.0 or higher.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data.",
  "targets": "None; there are no sinks or data processing points.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists in this static declaration.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a simple dependency declaration with no suspicious or unusual behavior. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard dependency declaration, listing a single package requirement for 'tortoise-orm'. It contains only comments and a tuple assignment. No input/output, network activity, or execution of dynamic code is present. The licensing comments are standard and do not affect security. Overall, the code is benign and typical for open-source project dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward dependency listing with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It poses no threat or risk.",
