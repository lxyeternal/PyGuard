  "purpose": "Define a tuple of instrument dependencies for OpenTelemetry instrumentation.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data sinks or external outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths exist as there are no inputs or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The code is simply defining a tuple containing a single dependency string. It contains only a license header and a variable assignment, with no input handling, data processing, or network activity. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and safe. It only sets a dependency version requirement for a package.",
