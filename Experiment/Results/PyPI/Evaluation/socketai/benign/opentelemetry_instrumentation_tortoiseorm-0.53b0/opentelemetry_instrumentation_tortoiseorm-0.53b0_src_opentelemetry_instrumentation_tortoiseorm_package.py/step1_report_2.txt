  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code merely assigns a string tuple.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and contains license comments and a dependency declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of license comments and a single assignment statement setting a tuple with a dependency string. No external input, data processing, or dynamic code execution occurs. The dependency string appears to be a version requirement specification for a Python package. There are no indications of malicious behavior, code injection, or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily serving as a dependency declaration with license and copyright comments. No malicious or security-related issues are evident.",
