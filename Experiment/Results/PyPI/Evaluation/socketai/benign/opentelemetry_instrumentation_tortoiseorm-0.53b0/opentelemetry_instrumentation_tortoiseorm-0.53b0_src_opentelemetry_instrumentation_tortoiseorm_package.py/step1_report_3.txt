  "purpose": "Define a tuple of instrument packages for OpenTelemetry instrumentation.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded package specification strings.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no data or untrusted input processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only static assignment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, containing only a tuple of package requirements; no unusual or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple declaration of a tuple containing a package string with a version constraint. There are no input handling, data processing, network communication, or other potentially risky operations. The only activity is storing a static string. No obfuscated code, no hardcoded credentials, and no malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a configuration or dependency list for instrumentation. It does not contain malware, security risks, or anomalies.",
