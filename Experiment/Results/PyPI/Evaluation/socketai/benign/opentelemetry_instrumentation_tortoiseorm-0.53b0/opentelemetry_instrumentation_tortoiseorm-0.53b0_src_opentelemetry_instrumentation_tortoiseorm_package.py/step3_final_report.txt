  "purpose": "Declare dependency for 'tortoise-orm >= 0.17.0' or similar packages, serving as a static dependency list.",
  "sources": "Assignment of a tuple containing dependency strings, comments with license info.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static assignment with no external data or untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static tuple assignment listing dependencies, accompanied by license comments. It contains no dynamic behavior, input/output, network activity, or obfuscation. The dependency declaration is standard for open-source projects. No malicious or suspicious code is present. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0, reflecting the benign nature. Confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign dependency declaration with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All signals indicate a safe, standard pattern for dependency management.",
