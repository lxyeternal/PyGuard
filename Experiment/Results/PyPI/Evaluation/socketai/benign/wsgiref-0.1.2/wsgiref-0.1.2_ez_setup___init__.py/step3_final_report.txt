  "purpose": "Bootstrap setuptools installation and upgrade with integrity validation and self-update of MD5 hashes.",
  "sources": "Network download of egg files, reading local files for MD5 validation, source code for self-modification.",
  "sinks": "Writing egg files to disk, overwriting source code for MD5 updates, printing to stderr and stdout.",
  "flows": "Download egg from remote URL -> validate MD5 -> save egg -> possibly modify source code to update MD5 registry.",
  "anomalies": "Self-modification of source code for MD5 registry update, use of deprecated modules (md5, urllib2), network activity without explicit user confirmation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a legacy bootstrap script for setuptools, designed to download specific egg files, validate their integrity via MD5, and install or upgrade setuptools. It includes a self-update mechanism that rewrites its own source to keep MD5 hashes current. No malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or covert operations is evident. The use of deprecated modules indicates legacy code but not malicious obfuscation. The network operations and self-modification pose supply chain risks but are typical for such setup utilities. The MD5 validation helps prevent tampering, though MD5 is outdated. Overall, the script performs its intended function with low security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, legacy bootstrap utility for setuptools, with no signs of malicious intent. Its main risks are related to supply chain security due to remote downloads and self-modification, but these are standard for such tools. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2).",
