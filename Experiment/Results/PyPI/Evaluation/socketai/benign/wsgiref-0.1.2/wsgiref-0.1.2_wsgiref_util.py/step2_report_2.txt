  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Provides WSGI utilities, no malicious behavior, uses standard practices.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, risk 0.2, obfuscated 0, confidence 0.9.\n- **Analysis:** The code is utility functions with no signs of malicious activity. Minor outdated practices ('has_key') and formatting issues are noted but not security concerns.\n- **Conclusion:** The low risk and malware scores are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The scoring seems reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar utility functions, no malicious logic, outdated 'has_key' method.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, risk 0.1, obfuscated 0, confidence 0.9.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity. Outdated syntax ('has_key') is a concern but not malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** The low malware and risk scores are justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions, outdated modules ('StringIO'), 'has_key', potential normalization issues.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, risk 0.1, obfuscated 0, confidence 0.9.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, just legacy code practices.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions, uses 'has_key', no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, risk 0.2, obfuscated 0, confidence 0.9.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity; use of deprecated methods is a concern but not malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores seem appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions, no malicious intent, deprecated syntax.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, risk 0.2, obfuscated 0, confidence 0.9.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity detected; minor code style issues.\n- **Conclusion:** The scoring aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, indicating no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with clear, readable code.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low (0.1–0.2), justified by the utility nature of the code, with no evident vulnerabilities or malicious patterns.\n\n### My Final Estimation:\n\nGiven the consistent analysis and scoring, I agree with the provided scores. The code is a standard utility library for WSGI applications, with outdated practices but no malicious intent.\n\n**My personal scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (consistent with reports)\n\n**Summary:** The code appears safe, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The minor outdated syntax does not impact security but should be updated for modern Python compatibility.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The scores are appropriate, and I concur with the assessments provided.",
