{
  "purpose": "Provides WSGI utility functions for handling environment setup, URI construction, path shifting, and header analysis in web applications.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (environ), reads from file-like objects, imports from urllib, and uses internal variables for header analysis.",
  "sinks": "Uses environment variables for constructing URLs, reading from file-like objects, and potential data processing within functions.",
  "flows": "Environment data flows from environ into URL functions and path manipulations; file-like objects flow data for the FileWrapper class; header analysis functions evaluate header names.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'has_key' method (deprecated in Python 3), which could indicate outdated code but not malicious; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious strings; no obfuscated code; presence of normal utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of WSGI utility functions aimed at request environment handling and URL/path manipulation. The code uses standard Python practices with no evident malicious logic. Use of 'has_key' is outdated but not malicious. Functions are straightforward and do not include any network activity, system modifications, or data exfiltration. No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no code injection, or backdoors are present. The code appears to be legitimate, utility-oriented, and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of WSGI utilities without any malicious intent or behavior. It does not perform any harmful actions, and no suspicious or malicious patterns are detected. The only minor concern is the outdated 'has_key' method, which does not affect security.",
