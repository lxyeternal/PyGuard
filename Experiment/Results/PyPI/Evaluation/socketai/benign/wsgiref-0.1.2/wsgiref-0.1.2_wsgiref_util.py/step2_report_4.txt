  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code to determine if the assessments are reasonable and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Utility functions for WSGI, environment setup, URL handling.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or network connections. URL encoding and environment handling are standard. Minor outdated practices ('has_key') and stylistic issues.\n- **Malware & risk scores:** 0, 0.2 respectively.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The code is utility-oriented, safe, with no malicious intent. The low security risk aligns with the code's functions.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's assessment seems reasonable. The low malware and risk scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** WSGI utilities for environment setup, URL/path manipulation.\n- **Findings:** Use of 'has_key' (deprecated), no hardcoded secrets, no malicious logic, no network activity.\n- **Malware & risk scores:** 0, 0.1.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent. The code is utility-focused, with minor outdated practices but no malicious patterns.\n\n**Conclusion:** The evaluation is sound. The low malware score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Utility functions for URL handling, environment setup, request processing.\n- **Findings:** Deprecated modules ('StringIO' instead of 'io.StringIO'), non-standard comparison operator ('<>'), potential normalization issues, but no malicious intent.\n- **Malware & risk scores:** 0, 0.1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The outdated modules and operators are noted but do not imply malicious activity.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment is appropriate; the low malware and risk scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Utility functions for URL handling, environment setup, header processing.\n- **Findings:** Use of 'has_key' (deprecated), no hardcoded secrets, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware & risk scores:** 0, 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent. The code is standard, utility-focused, with minor outdated practices.\n\n**Conclusion:** The evaluation aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Environment setup, request handling, data streaming.\n- **Findings:** Use of 'has_key', no malicious code, minimal input validation concerns, no backdoors.\n- **Malware & risk scores:** 0, 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable. The code is standard, with deprecated syntax but no malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment appears justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Presence of issues:** No, none of the reports find actual malicious code or backdoors.\n- **Errors or flaws:** Outdated practices ('has_key', 'StringIO') are noted but are not security issues.\n- **Scores:** All are appropriately low, reflecting the utility nature of the code.\n- **Malware score justification:** Zero across all reports is correct; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Anomalies:** Minor outdated syntax and stylistic issues, but nothing suspicious or malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Security risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (minimal, mostly due to outdated practices, not malicious intent)\n\n**Note:** Given the code's nature as utility functions, the scores are appropriately low. No further escalation is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code appears safe, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The low risk scores are justified, and the outdated practices are not security concerns but should be updated for modern Python compatibility.",
