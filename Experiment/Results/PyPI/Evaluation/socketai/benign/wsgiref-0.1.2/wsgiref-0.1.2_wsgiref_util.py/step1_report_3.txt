{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions and classes for WSGI applications, including URL handling, environment setup, and request processing.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (environ parameter), HTTP headers, and standard libraries such as urllib, posixpath, and StringIO.",
  "sinks": "URL construction (application_uri, request_uri), environment modifications (shift_path_info), and environment variable reads.",
  "flows": "Input data from environ and headers flow into URL construction and environment modification functions, with some URL encoding and environment updates.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated Python modules (StringIO instead of io.StringIO), a non-standard comparison operator ('<>'), and potential normalization issues with path handling. No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code contains utility functions for WSGI environment handling, such as URL scheme guessing, environment setup for testing, URL and path manipulations, and header classification. The use of deprecated modules and the outdated 'has_key' method suggest legacy code but not malicious intent. No data exfiltration, network communication, or hidden backdoors are present. The code appears to be standard, utility-focused, and designed for safe WSGI environment management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of WSGI utility functions with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It employs legacy Python features but lacks any indication of sabotage, data leakage, or malware. Overall, it appears safe and intended for normal application use.",
