  "purpose": "Manage and manipulate HTTP response headers in a structured way.",
  "sources": "Input data is primarily from the 'headers' argument during initialization, and from method parameters such as 'name', 'value', and '_params' in various methods.",
  "sinks": "Data returned by getters (e.g., get, get_all) and formatted headers in __str__() could potentially be used for injection if untrusted data is inserted into headers; however, the code does not perform any direct actions that could lead to code execution or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Input data (headers list and method parameters) flows into internal storage; get methods read from this storage; add_header and __setitem__ modify headers; __str__ formats headers for transmission.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated 'ListType' and 'TupleType' from 'types' module (not inherently malicious but outdated); the code uses backtick operator (`) in __repr__, which is deprecated in Python 3 and may cause syntax issues; no evidence of malicious code, but the __repr__ implementation could produce misleading output. The code does not sanitize header values, which could lead to header injection if used insecurely, but this is standard behavior for a headers management class. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a headers management class with methods to add, delete, retrieve, and format HTTP headers. It relies on list of tuples for storage and performs standard operations such as case-insensitive header name handling. The code includes outdated Python syntax and minor issues like deprecated 'types' usage and __repr__ implementation. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security-critical vulnerabilities. It handles headers as strings without sanitization, which could be a vector for header injection if used insecurely outside this code, but within this module, it functions as a straightforward header container.",
  "conclusion": "This module provides standard HTTP header management functionality with no evidence of malicious intent or malware. Minor outdated syntax exists but does not indicate malicious activity. The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious manipulation. Overall, it appears to be a benign utility class with standard behavior.",
