  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for managing HTTP headers. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. Minor syntax issues and deprecated type usage should be addressed for modern Python compatibility, but these do not constitute security risks. Overall, the code poses a very low security risk and is suitable for production with minor updates."
