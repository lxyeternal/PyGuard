{
  "purpose": "Manage and format HTTP response headers, allowing addition, deletion, and retrieval of headers in a structured manner.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the initialization parameter 'headers' in the Headers class, as well as from method parameters such as 'name', 'value', and '_params' in various methods.",
  "sinks": "The code constructs header strings, notably in the '_formatparam' function and the '__str__' method, which generate output data for HTTP transmission.",
  "flows": "Input data from 'headers' flows into internal storage; header names and values are retrieved or manipulated via methods, and formatted into strings for output; no external data or untrusted sources directly influence critical operations beyond input parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses 'ListType' and 'TupleType' from the 'types' module, which are deprecated in favor of 'list' and 'tuple'. There are no apparent hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network operations. The code relies on standard string formatting and regex; no obfuscated code or malicious payloads are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles HTTP headers via a custom Headers class, including methods for adding, deleting, and retrieving headers. The functions for formatting parameters ('_formatparam') and generating string representations ('__str__') follow standard practices. There is no evidence of code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior. No network or system access is attempted. The use of deprecated 'types' is noted but not malicious. Overall, the code appears benign, focusing solely on header management with no suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for managing HTTP headers without any malicious intent or suspicious activity. It does not contain malware or security risks beyond typical coding errors (e.g., deprecated 'types'). It is safe to use, with a very low malware and security risk score.",
