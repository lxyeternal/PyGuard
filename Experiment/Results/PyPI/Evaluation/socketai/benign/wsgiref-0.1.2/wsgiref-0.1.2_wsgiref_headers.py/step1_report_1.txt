  "purpose": "Manage HTTP response headers by providing a class to store, retrieve, modify, and format headers.",
  "sources": "Input is provided through the constructor (__init__) as a list of header tuples. No other explicit data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "Headers are stored internally; the add_header method formats header parameters, but no data is transmitted externally or used in a harmful way within this code.",
  "flows": "Input headers are stored in self._headers; methods retrieve, modify, or delete headers; add_header constructs header strings but does not execute external commands or send data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The code uses standard library functions and practices for handling headers.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Headers class for managing HTTP headers, including adding, deleting, and retrieving headers. It performs standard operations without any external communication, obfuscation, or malicious data handling. The use of regex for quoting parameter values is safe and typical. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malicious intent. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of header management, with no hidden or suspicious functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation for managing HTTP headers. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a typical utility class with no dangerous features or external communications.",
