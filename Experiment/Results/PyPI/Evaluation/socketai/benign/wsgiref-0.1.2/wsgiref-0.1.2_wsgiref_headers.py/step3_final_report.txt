{
  "purpose": "Manage a collection of HTTP response headers, allowing addition, deletion, retrieval, and formatting of headers for HTTP transmission.",
  "sources": "Headers are read from the input list during initialization; header values are accessed via methods like get(), get_all(), or directly through __getitem__.",
  "sinks": "Header values are formatted into strings for transmission via __str__() and __repr__(), but no external data sinks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input headers are stored internally; methods retrieve or modify headers; formatted headers are generated for output, with no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated types ListType and TupleType; __repr__ method uses backticks instead of repr(); no input sanitization for header values, which could lead to header injection if misused externally.",
  "analysis": "The code manages headers in memory as a list of tuples, providing methods for access, modification, and formatting. It uses standard practices, with minor issues such as deprecated type usage and a syntax error in __repr__. No malicious code, external communication, or obfuscation is present. The regex for parameter quoting is standard and safe. The header management is straightforward, with no evident security vulnerabilities within this scope.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for managing HTTP headers. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. Minor syntax issues and deprecated type usage should be addressed for modern Python compatibility, but these do not constitute security risks. Overall, the code poses a very low security risk and is suitable for production with minor updates.",
