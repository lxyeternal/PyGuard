{
  "purpose": "Manage and format HTTP response headers, providing methods for header manipulation such as addition, deletion, retrieval, and string formatting for HTTP transmission.",
  "sources": "Input data is from the 'headers' parameter in the __init__ method, and header values via methods like add_header, __setitem__, and __getitem__.",
  "sinks": "Header data stored internally in self._headers; formatting functions like _formatparam could potentially handle malicious input if misused in other contexts.",
  "flows": "Input headers from constructor → stored in self._headers → manipulated via various methods → formatted into string for transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns such as obfuscated code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. The code is mostly standard header management with straightforward string formatting. No use of eval, exec, or insecure data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a typical header management class with methods for adding, deleting, retrieving, and formatting headers. It uses regex for quoting header parameter values, and manages headers as list of tuples. No external network operations, no suspicious data handling, and no code injection mechanisms are evident. The initial import of 'types' for ListType and TupleType is outdated but harmless. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. Overall, the logic is standard and does not contain malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign HTTP header management module with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It performs expected operations related to headers with no external dependencies that could introduce vulnerabilities.",
