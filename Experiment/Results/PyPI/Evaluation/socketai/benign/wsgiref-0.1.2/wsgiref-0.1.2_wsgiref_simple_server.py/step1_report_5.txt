{
  "purpose": "This code implements a simple WSGI-compliant HTTP server for testing and debugging web applications locally.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (e.g., server environment setup), HTTP request headers, request data via self.rfile, and application input via self.server.get_app().",
  "sinks": "Uses self.wfile to send HTTP responses, sys.stderr for logging, and runs an example app that outputs to StringIO (not an external sink).",
  "flows": "Request data flows from self.rfile through parse_request and get_environ to the application, with response written via self.wfile. Environment setup and headers influence data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external connections are evident. The application is a basic demo with no apparent malicious behavior. No obfuscated code is present. No data leakage or malicious sinks detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a minimal WSGI server implementation, including environment setup, request handling, and a demo app that outputs request headers and a greeting. The server binds to a specified port and handles a single request before exiting. The implementation appears straightforward, with no signs of malicious data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. Usage of sys.stderr for logging is standard. The demo application outputs data to stdout without external network communication or data theft mechanisms. Overall, the code appears benign and intended for local testing.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a basic, non-obfuscated, WSGI server example with no malicious intent detected. It is suitable for testing local web applications. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident based on this analysis.",
