  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code, its logic, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a minimal, educational WSGI server primarily for local testing.\n- Uses deprecated modules (BaseHTTPServer, StringIO, urllib.unquote), which is typical for Python 2.x code.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious external network activity.\n- The server opens a web browser automatically upon startup, which is unusual but common in testing scripts.\n- No evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- The environment setup and request handling are straightforward and standard.\n\n---\n\n### **Malware Score Analysis**\n\n**Current scores: 0 for all reports.**\n\n- **Justification:**  \n  The code does not perform any malicious actions such as executing system commands, exfiltrating data, connecting to external malicious domains, or embedding backdoors. The automatic browser opening is benign in a testing context.  \n- **Conclusion:**  \n  Malware score should remain **0**.\n\n---\n\n### **Obfuscated Score Analysis**\n\n**Current scores: 0 for all reports.**\n\n- **Justification:**  \n  The code is clear, straightforward, and uses standard libraries. No obfuscation techniques are present.  \n- **Conclusion:**  \n  Obfuscated score should remain **0**.\n\n---\n\n### **Security Risk Score Analysis**\n\n**Current scores range from 0.2 to 0.3.**\n\n- **Justification:**  \n  The code is intended for local testing and does not include input validation, error handling, or security hardening. If used improperly in production, it could be vulnerable to injection or other issues, but as-is, it's benign.  \n  - The scores seem slightly elevated due to the use of deprecated modules and the automatic browser launch, which could be considered \"unusual\" but not risky in a security sense.  \n  - Given the context, a score of 0.2-0.3 seems reasonable, reflecting low but non-zero potential for misconfiguration or misuse in production.  \n- **Conclusion:**  \n  The current scores are reasonable. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Consistency and Justification**\n\n- The reports correctly identify the code as a simple, local testing server.\n- No suspicious behavior or malicious activity is evident.\n- The scores reflect the benign nature, with low security risk and no malware or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Assessment**\n\n| Score Type       | Estimated Value | Justification                                                                                 |\n|------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | **0**             | No malicious activity, payload, or backdoors present.                                    |\n| Obfuscated       | **0**             | Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.                                           |\n| Security Risk    | **0.2**           | Slightly elevated due to deprecated modules and automatic browser launch; still low.     |\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign, minimal WSGI server intended for local testing. It does not pose malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The existing scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nMaintain current scores.
