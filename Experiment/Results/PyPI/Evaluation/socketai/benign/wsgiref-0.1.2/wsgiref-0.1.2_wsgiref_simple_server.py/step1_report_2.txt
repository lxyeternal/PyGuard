  "purpose": "Implement a basic WSGI-compatible HTTP server for testing or debugging web applications locally.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (server info, request headers), incoming request data via self.rfile, and request parameters (path, query).",
  "sinks": "Logs requests with log_request; outputs to sys.stderr; opens a web browser; handles HTTP request/response.",
  "flows": "Incoming request data flows from self.rfile through parse_request to get_environ, then to run() which calls the app; responses and logs are generated accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "Uses deprecated modules (BaseHTTPServer, StringIO, urllib.unquote); no explicit input validation or sanitization; no hardcoded credentials; opens a web browser automatically on startup; uses potentially unsafe sys.stderr for error output.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a minimal WSGI server with standard library modules, mainly for testing. It captures request data, prepares environment variables, and runs a simple application. It does not contain obfuscated code or malicious functions. The automatic opening of a web browser and reliance on deprecated modules are noteworthy but not malicious. No suspicious data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful payloads are present. Overall, the code appears benign and intended solely for local testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This script provides a basic WSGI server for testing web apps locally. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks based on the analysis. While some outdated practices are present, there are no signs of malware or intentional sabotage.",
