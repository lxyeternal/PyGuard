{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging the 'wsgiref' Python library, used to define package metadata and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.txt' file for long_description",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; setup configuration is static and safe",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading 'README.txt' into the setup function; no external data sources or untrusted input flows detected",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'ez_setup' and 'use_setuptools()' is somewhat outdated but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'ez_setup' to ensure setuptools is available, then proceeds to set up package metadata using static values. The long_description is read from a local file, which is standard practice. No code injection, network activity, or suspicious operations are present. The code follows typical package setup patterns with no anomalies or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It simply defines package metadata for distribution.",
