  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'wsgiref', used to configure package metadata and installation parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.txt' for long_description; imports 'ez_setup' and 'setuptools'; static metadata definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no network or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration without dynamic or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'ez_setup' which is deprecated; no obfuscated code or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with static metadata, no dynamic or malicious behavior. The use of 'ez_setup' is outdated but not security-critical. No external data flows, network activity, or obfuscated code are present. All signals indicate benign intent, with scores reflecting no malware, no obfuscation, and no security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard Python package setup file with no malicious or security-threatening elements. The outdated 'ez_setup' usage does not impact security but should be updated for best practices. Overall, the code poses no security risk.",
