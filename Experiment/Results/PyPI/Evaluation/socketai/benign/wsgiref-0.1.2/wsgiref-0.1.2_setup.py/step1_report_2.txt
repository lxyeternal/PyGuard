  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the wsgiref Python library",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.txt' for long_description, importing ez_setup and setuptools modules",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data flows or network actions",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; setup metadata is static and safe",
  "anomalies": "Use of ez_setup, which is outdated and potentially risky, but not malicious; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The script initializes the packaging process for the wsgiref library, importing standard modules and setting metadata. It reads a README file for description, which could cause an error if the file is missing but isn't malicious. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling is present. The presence of ez_setup is unusual but not inherently malicious; it is an outdated practice but not a security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The use of ez_setup is outdated but not harmful in this context.",
