  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's behavior, potential vulnerabilities, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides base classes for WSGI and CGI handlers, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies that the code is standard server handling code with no signs of malware. The low risk score is appropriate given the lack of vulnerabilities or malicious indicators. The malware and obfuscated scores are justified as zero.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines base classes for WSGI and CGI, with standard practices, legacy compatibility, and no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the code is typical for server frameworks. The low risk score aligns with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious features. The zero malware and obfuscated scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to above, with standard environment setup, response handling, and no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis is consistent. The low risk and malware scores are appropriate, considering no malicious behavior is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on standard server request handling, with some outdated syntax (e.g., 'has_key', 'StringType') but no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe slightly higher risk score reflects the outdated practices, which could be potential security concerns if exploited, but not inherently malicious. The malware score remains zero, which is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Provides standard WSGI/CGI server classes, with no suspicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe conclusion and scores are consistent. No malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign a score of 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or external communication.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with the code's clarity and lack of obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2). Given the outdated syntax (use of 'has_key', 'StringType') and legacy compatibility workarounds, a slightly elevated score (around 0.2) is reasonable but not indicative of malicious intent.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Security Risk:** 0.2\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard server-side framework component, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The minor legacy practices do not introduce significant security concerns but are worth noting for modernization.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. The scores are reasonable and justified based on the code's content. No modifications needed.",
