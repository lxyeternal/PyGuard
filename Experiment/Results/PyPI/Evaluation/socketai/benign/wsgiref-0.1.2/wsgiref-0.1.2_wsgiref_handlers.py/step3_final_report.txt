{
  "purpose": "The code provides base classes for WSGI and CGI server/gateway implementations, handling environment setup, request processing, response headers, and error management.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, input streams (get_stdin), output streams (stdout), error streams (stderr), and request data.",
  "sinks": "Data written via _write(), headers sent via send_headers(), error logs via log_exception(), and response data through finish_response().",
  "flows": "Source data from environment and input streams flow into response headers and body; exceptions flow into log_exception and error handling; response headers flow into send_headers and _write.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated 'has_key' method, legacy 'StringType' for type checks, fallback 'dict' function for older Python versions, static date/time formatting, and assertions for validation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, legacy-compatible implementation of server request handlers, with no signs of malicious behavior, external network activity, or obfuscation. It employs outdated syntax but functions as a typical server framework. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The use of legacy practices does not introduce security risks but indicates the code's age and compatibility focus.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard server handler framework with no malicious intent or sabotage. The low malware score (0) and obfuscated score (0) are appropriate. The slight elevation in security risk score (~0.2) reflects legacy syntax and practices but does not indicate active vulnerabilities. Overall, the code is safe for deployment, and the reports' assessments are accurate.",
