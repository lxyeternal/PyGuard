{
  "purpose": "This code defines base classes and handlers for managing WSGI applications, CGI-like systems, and server responses in Python web servers.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables from 'os.environ', input streams ('sys.stdin'), and output/error streams ('sys.stdout', 'sys.stderr'). It also uses imported modules 'util' and 'headers'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include writing data to output streams, setting HTTP headers, and handling error information which could leak sensitive data if misused.",
  "flows": "Input data from environment variables or streams flows into handler methods which may write responses or headers, but no untrusted data is directly processed into executable code or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes compatibility fallbacks for 'dict', 'True', and 'False' definitions, which is typical for older or cross-version Python. No suspicious hardcoded credentials or unusual code behaviors are evident. The use of 'assert' statements for input validation is standard. No obfuscated code or malicious functions are present.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes server response handling, environment setup, and error management for WSGI and CGI systems. It uses imported modules for headers and file wrapping, but these are assumed benign. There are no dynamic code execution features, no network calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The fallback definitions for 'dict', 'True', and 'False' suggest legacy compatibility but are not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are identified. The overall structure aligns with standard server handler patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of server request handling classes without any malicious intent or security risks. It manages data flow and response formatting securely, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
