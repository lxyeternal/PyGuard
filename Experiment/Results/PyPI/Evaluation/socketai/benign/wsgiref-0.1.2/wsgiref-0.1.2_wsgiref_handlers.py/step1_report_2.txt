{
  "purpose": "Defines base classes for WSGI application handling, including HTTP and CGI handlers, for web server implementations.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (types, util, headers, sys, os, time), and internal class and function definitions.",
  "sinks": "Uses environment variables, standard input/output/error streams, and the ability to send data over network streams via _write() method; potential for data leakage or interference if misused.",
  "flows": "Input streams (sys.stdin, sys.stderr, environment variables) flow into class initializations and methods like add_cgi_vars; data output flows through _write() methods, especially in send_headers(), write(), finish_response().",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'dict' fallback function may be unconventional but benign; the code performs standard HTTP and CGI handling without obfuscated code or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. Use of 'assert' statements for type and format checks is standard but could be bypassed if assertions are disabled; no evidence of malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured framework for handling WSGI applications and CGI-based protocols. It carefully manages environment setup, response headers, and data transmission with standard practices. The fallback definitions for 'dict', 'True', and 'False' are benign and for compatibility. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as network data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code is evident. The code relies on subclasses to implement actual data transmission (_write, _flush), which could potentially be misused if subclassed maliciously, but the base code itself is standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured framework for HTTP and CGI handlers with no signs of malicious intent. It handles environment setup, response formatting, and data output securely and transparently. There are no anomalies or malicious behaviors detected. The overall security risk is low.",
