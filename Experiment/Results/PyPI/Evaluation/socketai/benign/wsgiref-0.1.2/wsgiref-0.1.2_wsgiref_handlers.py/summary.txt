  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard server handler framework with no malicious intent or sabotage. The low malware score (0) and obfuscated score (0) are appropriate. The slight elevation in security risk score (~0.2) reflects legacy syntax and practices but does not indicate active vulnerabilities. Overall, the code is safe for deployment, and the reports' assessments are accurate."
