{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes and operator overloads to construct symbolic expression trees, enabling intuitive building of expressions for evaluation or manipulation within larger systems.",
  "sources": "Attribute access (__getattr__, __getitem__), operator overloading methods (__add__, __sub__, etc.), and function wrappers (__call__ in Expr classes).",
  "sinks": "Evaluation of expressions via __call__, which may invoke functions or access object attributes; no external data sinks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (attributes, functions) flow through expression objects (__call__) to produce evaluated results; no external data leaks or system modifications occur.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no suspicious code patterns, no hidden payloads. The patch for operator.div is a compatibility fix, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs symbolic expressions through operator overloading, enabling building expression trees that can be evaluated later. It does not perform any network communication, code injection, or data exfiltration. The use of __call__ methods to invoke stored functions or access attributes is standard for such expression frameworks. The initial patch for operator.div ensures compatibility across Python versions. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and serves as a utility for symbolic expression manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign symbolic expression builder with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
