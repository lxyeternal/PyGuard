{
  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for representing bytes and integers as hexadecimal strings, displaying hex dumps, and converting hex dumps back to bytes, primarily for debugging or data inspection purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input parameters 'data' in the hexdump and hexundump functions.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to external systems, network, or files; it only processes and returns strings or byte data internally.",
  "flows": "Input data (bytes) is processed in hexdump to generate a formatted hex string with line addresses; hexundump takes a formatted string and reconstructs the original bytes.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The code performs straightforward data formatting and conversion without external side effects or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code provides internal utilities for hex representation and data visualization. It uses safe standard library functions (binascii) and simple string formatting. No data is sent over the network, written to files, or executed dynamically. The functions include input validation for size limits and proper string handling. Overall, the code is standard for debugging and does not contain malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module for hex representation and dump formatting, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It operates purely on data processing without external side effects.",
