  "purpose": "Utility functions and classes for hex representation, dump formatting, and conversion between binary and hex strings, used internally for data visualization and debugging.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as data bytes, class attributes, and function arguments.",
  "sinks": "Formatting output strings, internal data processing; no external data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input bytes through formatting functions to string representations for display.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward utilities for hex dumping and undumping, using standard libraries (`binascii`) and simple string formatting. No external communication, no code injection, and no malicious patterns are present. The functions are purely for internal data visualization, with size validation to prevent excessive data processing. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility module for hex data representation with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals indicate safe, straightforward data formatting functions.",
