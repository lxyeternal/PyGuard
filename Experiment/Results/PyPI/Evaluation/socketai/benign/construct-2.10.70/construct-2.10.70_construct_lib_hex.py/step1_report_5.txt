{
  "purpose": "Provides internal utility classes and functions for representing and displaying bytes and integers in hexadecimal format, including hexdump and undump functionalities.",
  "sources": "Input data for functions `hexdump` and `hexundump`, and class attributes referencing internal data (e.g., self['data']).",
  "sinks": "The functions output formatted strings that include hex and ASCII representations; no direct data leak or malicious sink identified.",
  "flows": "Input data to `hexdump`, which produces a formatted string; `hexundump` takes such a string and reconstructs the byte data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; the classes and functions are straightforward utilities for hex display. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines internal classes for representing integers and bytes in hexadecimal form, mainly for display purposes. The `hexdump` function converts binary data into a formatted hex + ASCII string, and `hexundump` reverses this process. No external input sources, network calls, or credential handling are involved. The code is purely utility-oriented, with no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a utility for hex display and conversion, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be safe and intended for internal data formatting and visualization.",
