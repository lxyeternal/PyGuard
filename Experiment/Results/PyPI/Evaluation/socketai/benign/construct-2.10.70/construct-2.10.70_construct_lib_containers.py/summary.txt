  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for data containers with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1-0.2, reflecting minimal concern mainly due to regex usage. All reports are consistent with this assessment, and no changes are necessary."
