  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Describes container classes with attribute access, string representation, and regex search. No suspicious behavior or malicious code detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. The confidence is high (0.9).\n- **Assessment:** The code appears benign, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The global flags and class methods are standard for such utility classes.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues; scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar utility classes with emphasis on data handling and display. No network or malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Confidence is high (0.9).\n- **Assessment:** The code is a utility module with no malicious intent. The slight security risk score (0.2) reflects minimal concern, possibly due to potential misuse if untrusted data is processed, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility classes with attribute access, regex search, and pretty-printing. No malicious code or backdoors found.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Confidence 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity. The risk score accounts for potential data exposure via string representations but remains low.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility classes with data management and regex search. No external data sources or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. Confidence 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The code is a standard utility library with no malicious features. The low risk score aligns with the benign nature.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores seem justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility classes with regex search and attribute access. No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. Confidence 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, with no malicious intent or suspicious features.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, consistent with the clear, readable code.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal security concern mainly due to potential misuse, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious features.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, mostly theoretical concern)\n\n**Additional notes:** The code appears to be a benign utility library for data containers, with no evidence of supply chain compromise or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Estimate |\n|-----------------|----------------|\n| Malware         | 0              |\n| Obfuscated      | 0              |\n| Security Risk   | 0.1            |\n\nThis assessment confirms that the code is safe and does not pose a security threat.",
