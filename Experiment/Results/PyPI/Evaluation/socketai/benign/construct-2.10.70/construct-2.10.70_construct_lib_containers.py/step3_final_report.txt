{
  "purpose": "Provides enhanced container classes with attribute access, regex search, and customizable string representations for data handling.",
  "sources": "Data is read from internal dictionary and list structures via class methods and attribute access.",
  "sinks": "String representations (__str__, __repr__) output data; regex search functions process internal data; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Data flows into container objects, can be retrieved or displayed via string methods or regex search, with no external data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads detected. Use of global flags is benign; import of construct.lib.py3compat is for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility container classes with attribute access, regex search, and customizable string output. No network, file, or malicious code is present. The regex functions could be misused with malicious patterns, but this is a general regex concern, not specific to this code. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or malicious intent. The global flags and methods are standard for such utility classes. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to potential regex misuse, but no actual vulnerabilities are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for data containers with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1-0.2, reflecting minimal concern mainly due to regex usage. All reports are consistent with this assessment, and no changes are necessary.",
