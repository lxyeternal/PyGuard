  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom stream classes with buffering, encoding, and seeking features. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The assigned malware score of 0 and low security risk scores are justified and consistent with the analysis."
