  "purpose": "Implement custom in-memory stream classes with buffering, encoding, and decoding functionalities for data processing.",
  "sources": "substream inputs in __init__, read methods, write methods, seek methods, and buffer management variables.",
  "sinks": "write method writes encoded data to substream, and seek methods may influence data flow.",
  "flows": "Data flows from substream to buffers during reads; from buffers to substream during writes; and via decoding/encoding functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; no suspicious network activity or data exfiltration observed. Use of sleep() with zero delay is benign here, used for blocking I/O handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes: RestreamedBytesIO and RebufferedBytesIO. Both are in-memory stream wrappers with buffering and encoding/decoding features. They manage internal buffers, support seeking, and handle data flow between substreams and internal buffers. The implementation appears focused on buffering and stream manipulation without any hidden or suspicious behavior. No external network activity, data leakage, or malicious operations are detected. Methods follow standard patterns, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs. The use of sleep(0) is benign and used for non-blocking reads. No hardcoded secrets or malicious logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements standard buffered stream wrappers with encoding and decoding features. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears safe and aligned with typical stream processing functionalities.",
