  "purpose": "This code defines an API surface for a Python module by importing various functions and classes from the 'construct.lib' package and exposing them via the __all__ list.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'construct.lib' modules such as construct.lib.containers, construct.lib.binary, construct.lib.bitstream, construct.lib.hex, and construct.lib.py3compat.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, external connections, or data sinks are present in the code.",
  "flows": "The code imports functions/classes from the library modules; there are no data flows, processing, or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from a well-known open-source library and an __all__ list defining the public API. There are no data processing, external inputs, dynamic code execution, or network activity. The code's simplicity and reliance on trusted library components indicate benign intent. All security and malware scores are appropriately zero, and confidence is high that the code is non-malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup for exposing functions and classes from the 'construct.lib' library. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are accurate, and no further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
