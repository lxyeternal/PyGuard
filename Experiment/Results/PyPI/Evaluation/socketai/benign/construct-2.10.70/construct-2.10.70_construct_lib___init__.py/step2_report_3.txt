  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code only imports functions and classes from 'construct.lib' and defines an '__all__' list. No data processing, external input, or suspicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risk.\n- **Comment:** The reasoning is sound; the code appears benign and standard.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it imports modules and declares public API elements. No processing or external data flows.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — correct.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security concern.\n- **Comment:** The analysis is consistent; no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Imports from 'construct.lib.*' and exposes functions/classes via '__all__'. No dynamic code, data handling, or external communication.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — straightforward imports.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security issues.\n- **Comment:** The conclusion aligns with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern—imports from 'construct.lib' and defines '__all__'. No processing or external interactions.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — correct.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risk.\n- **Comment:** The reasoning is consistent; the code is standard module setup.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar import and export pattern, with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security concern.\n- **Comment:** The analysis correctly identifies the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple module that imports functions and classes from a well-known library ('construct.lib') and declares an API via '__all__'.\n- There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The malware scores are all appropriately zero.\n- The obfuscated scores are zero, as expected.\n- The risk scores are all zero, consistent with the code's functionality.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports — justified.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 across all reports — justified.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 across all reports — justified.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a benign, standard module setup with no security concerns. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the nature of the code.",
