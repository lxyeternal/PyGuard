  "purpose": "This code imports modules and functions from the 'construct.lib' package and defines a list of public API elements for a library related to data parsing and manipulation.",
  "sources": "Imports modules from 'construct.lib', which are likely internal library components.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; no untrusted data processing or output occurs within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to internal library function calls and exports; no untrusted data sources or sinks are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely imports specific modules and functions from a library and defines an '__all__' list for public API exposure. There are no operations, data processing, or external interactions within this snippet. It appears to be a standard module initialization or interface definition with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module import and API declaration with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
