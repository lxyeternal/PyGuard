  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports various functions and classes from the 'construct.lib' package for data parsing and manipulation, and defines an export list.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'construct.lib' modules at the beginning of the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code only imports modules and defines an export list.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted inputs or external data processing within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are evident. The code solely consists of import statements and an '__all__' declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple utility functions and classes related to binary data processing from a library named 'construct.lib'. It then specifies the public API via the '__all__' list. There are no data processing, user input, or external connections. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be a standard module setup for data handling functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a straightforward module import and export setup without any signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
