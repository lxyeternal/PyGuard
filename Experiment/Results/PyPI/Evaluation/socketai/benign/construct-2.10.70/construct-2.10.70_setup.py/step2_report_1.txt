  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard Python package setup script.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or anomalies are detected.\n- All sources are static files or module attributes, with no untrusted data processing.\n- No hardcoded secrets, code injection, or dynamic execution present.\n- The package dependencies are benign and common.\n\n**Assessment of each report:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms no malicious intent, malware, or security risks.\n- Notes that the code reads from 'README.rst' and 'construct.version'.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score = 0; risk score = 0.  \n**Verdict:** Fully aligned with the code.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizes standard setup practices.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0; risk = 0.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Reiterates that no untrusted data or malicious behavior exists.\n- Reads static files and module attributes.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0; risk = 0.  \n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same conclusion: standard setup script, no malicious intent.\n- Reads static data, no dynamic code.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0; risk = 0.  \n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Consistent with others; no anomalies or suspicious activity.\n- Uses standard practices.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0; risk = 0.  \n**Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Code presence of malware or obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Any suspicious logic or anomalies:** No.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None, as the script only reads static files and imports version info.\n- **Scores assigned:** All reports assign malware and risk scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a straightforward setup script with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The data sources are static files or module attributes, not untrusted input.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling that could introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, and the assigned scores are justified.",
