{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the 'construct' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and project URLs.",
  "sources": "Reads version_string from construct.version, reads long_description from README.rst, and gathers static package metadata.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data outputs or data handling that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration with controlled inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution; standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setup' from setuptools and 'version_string' from construct.version. It calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. Reads README content directly without sanitization but that is standard for package description. No user input or untrusted data sources involved. No malicious behavior or backdoors detected. Dependencies are common libraries, and the code structure is typical for a setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and free from supply chain attacks.",
