{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging and distributing a Python library called 'construct'.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from 'construct.version', reads the README file for long description, and gathers metadata for package configuration.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing; no data leaks or vulnerable code identified.",
  "flows": "Reads version string and README content, then uses this data in package setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs. External data files are read straightforwardly.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the package version, reads the README for description, and configures package metadata. No dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no handling of untrusted input are present. All data is sourced from local files or static variables. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors. External dependencies listed are standard or non-malicious. The structure follows standard Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It reads static data and prepares package metadata without performing any risky operations.",
