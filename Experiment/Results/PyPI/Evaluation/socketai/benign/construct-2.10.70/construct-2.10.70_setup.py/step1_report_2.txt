  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package named 'construct', defining its metadata, dependencies, and project details.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from 'construct.version' and the content of 'README.rst' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data processing or external data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Reads version string from an imported module; reads README content into setup. No external data flow affecting security.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic observed. Usage of standard setup procedures with no embedded code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It imports version info from a module and reads a README file for description. All dependencies are explicitly listed and benign. No code execution or external data manipulation beyond typical package configuration is present. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. No suspicious patterns or anomalies found.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a typical package setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and well-structured for deploying a Python library.",
