  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for the 'construct' Python package, defining metadata, dependencies, and classifiers.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst' file and imports 'version_string' from local module 'construct.version'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs processed in a way that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Static data sources ('README.rst' and local module) used solely for package metadata; no dynamic or untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and adheres to standard packaging practices. No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that imports version info from a local module and reads a README file. It does not execute untrusted code, perform network operations, or process external input. All dependencies are benign, and the structure is conventional. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned by all reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are justified based on the static and safe nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications to the scores are necessary.",
