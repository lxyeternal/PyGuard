  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims and evaluating the scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports consistently identify the code as a standard Python setup script.\n- No untrusted data processing, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation is present.\n- The code only reads local files ('README.rst') and imports a version string from a local module ('construct.version').\n- All dependencies are benign, and no secrets or malicious logic are detected.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears correct and standard for a setup script.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns.\n- **Security risks:** None apparent; static configuration with no external untrusted data handling.\n\n---\n\n### Review of scores:\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|------------|--------------|--------|\n| 1       | 0          | 0            | 0      |\n| 2       | 0          | 0            | 0      |\n| 3       | 0          | 0            | 0      |\n| 4       | 0          | 0            | 0      |\n| 5       | 0          | 0            | 0      |\n\n**Justification:**\n- All reports assign zero to malware, obfuscated, and risk scores, which aligns with the analysis.\n- Since there's no malicious or suspicious behavior, these scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The only potential concern could be if the 'construct.version' module is malicious or compromised, but based on the provided information, it's a local import with no indication of malicious code.\n- Reading 'README.rst' is standard and safe; no sanitization issues or malicious content detected.\n- No dynamic or untrusted data sources involved.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is a typical, safe setup script with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the provided code and reports, I agree with the current scores. No changes are necessary. The package setup script is benign and poses no security risks.",
