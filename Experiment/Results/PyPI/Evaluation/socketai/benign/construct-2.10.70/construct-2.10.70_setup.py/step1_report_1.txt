{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package named 'construct' with metadata, dependencies, and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from 'README.rst' (long_description), version_string from 'construct.version', and static strings for metadata and URLs.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or executed; the script primarily performs static setup configuration.",
  "flows": "Input from 'README.rst' and 'construct.version' flows into package metadata fields; no dynamic or untrusted data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup using setuptools. It imports version information from a local module, reads a README file, and defines package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No code injection, malicious logic, or suspicious data handling is present. All operations are static configuration for packaging.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It simply defines package metadata and dependencies.",
