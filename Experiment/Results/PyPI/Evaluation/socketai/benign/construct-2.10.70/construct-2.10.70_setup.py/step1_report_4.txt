{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the 'construct' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and project information.",
  "sources": "Reading version from construct.version, reading long_description from 'README.rst', and listing metadata fields.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; all data sources are static or package-related metadata.",
  "flows": "Data flows from static files and module attributes into setup() configuration; no untrusted data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard setuptools to configure package installation. It reads version info and description from files, specifies dependencies, and sets metadata. No dynamic code execution, network access, or input handling is evident. No indicators of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. All dependencies are standard and benign. The code structure and logic are typical for a Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate and standard setup configuration for a Python package without any malicious intent or security risks.",
