  "purpose": "Utility functions for manipulating integers, bits, and byte strings, including conversions and byte order swapping.",
  "sources": "Input data is taken from function parameters such as 'number', 'data', or 'data' in various functions.",
  "sinks": "Data is returned directly or passed through conversion functions; no external data sinks are directly evident.",
  "flows": "Input data (numbers or byte strings) are converted through various functions, with no external data transmission or insecure processing observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or obfuscated variables. Functions are standard conversions; no malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard utility functions for bit/byte conversion, endianness swapping, and hex encoding. All functions perform straightforward, well-understood conversions and manipulations without external communications or suspicious logic. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or hidden backdoors are present. The code appears benign and typical for low-level data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of benign utility functions for data manipulation with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured and does not perform any suspicious actions.",
