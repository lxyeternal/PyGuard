{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for converting integers and bit/byte strings, swapping byte orders, and encoding/decoding hexadecimal data, primarily for binary data manipulation.",
  "sources": "Functions read input data from parameters such as 'number', 'width', and 'data' variables, often supplied by the caller or external data streams.",
  "sinks": "Data transformations produce outputs such as bytes, bits, or hex strings; potential sensitive data could be leaked if input data contains secrets or sensitive info.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through conversion functions (e.g., integer2bits, bits2integer, bytes2bits), which produce transformed outputs. No external network or system calls are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets detected. The functions are straightforward utility operations; no backdoors, code injections, or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions for data conversions and byte order manipulations, with appropriate error handling and documentation. No suspicious code patterns, malicious payloads, or obfuscation methods are evident. Functions handle data transformations safely and efficiently. No external network, system modifications, or backdoors are present. The code appears designed for binary data processing, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions for binary data manipulation. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. No malware or obfuscation detected. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for its intended purpose.",
