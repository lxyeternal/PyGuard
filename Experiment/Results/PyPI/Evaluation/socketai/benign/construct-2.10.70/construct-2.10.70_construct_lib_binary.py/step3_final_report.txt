  "purpose": "Collection of utility functions for data conversion and byte manipulation, including integer to bits/bytes, bits to integer, bytes to integer, and byte order swapping.",
  "sources": "Function inputs such as integers, byte strings, and bit strings; internal cache dictionaries for conversions.",
  "sinks": "No external data sources or sinks; functions operate solely on provided data.",
  "flows": "Input data (integers, bytes, bits) flows through conversion functions to produce transformed data; no external communication or data leakage points.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard data conversion utilities; variable shadowing ('min', 'max') is stylistic, not security-relevant.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard data conversion utilities with clear, well-documented functions. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external communication. Cache optimizations are typical for performance. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. The functions could be misused in security-sensitive contexts but are inherently benign. The code structure is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation techniques.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility functions for data conversion and byte manipulation, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily theoretical if misused, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious features are present.",
