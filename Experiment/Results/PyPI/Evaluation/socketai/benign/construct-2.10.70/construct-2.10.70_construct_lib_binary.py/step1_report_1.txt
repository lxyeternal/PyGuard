  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting integers and byte-strings to bit-strings and vice versa, as well as byte order swapping and hex encoding/decoding.",
  "sources": "Data read from input parameters such as 'number', 'data', and 'b'.",
  "sinks": "Return statements producing converted data, and operations on input data like swapping or encoding.",
  "flows": "Input data (number, data) flows through conversion functions (integer2bits, bits2integer, bytes2integer, etc.), resulting in processed output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden code. The functions perform standard data conversions and byte manipulations. Cache creation is normal for performance optimization. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for data manipulation primarily used for data encoding, decoding, and bit/byte conversions. All functions operate within typical bounds and do not execute any external or malicious commands. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or network activity. The code appears standard, well-structured, and suitable for data handling in other modules. No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions for data format conversions with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is benign and intended for standard data processing tasks.",
