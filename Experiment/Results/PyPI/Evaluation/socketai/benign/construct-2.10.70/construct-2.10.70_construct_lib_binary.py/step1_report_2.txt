{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting integers and byte strings to bits, and performing endianness and bit swaps, likely used for data serialization or cryptographic operations.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from function parameters such as 'number', 'data', and 'bytes'. No external data sources are explicitly accessed within this code.",
  "sinks": "Functions like 'integer2bytes', 'bits2integer', 'bytes2bits', 'swapbytes', 'swapbytesinbits', 'swapbitsinbytes', 'hexlify', and 'unhexlify' manipulate data but do not send data over networks or write to files; they operate solely in-memory.",
  "flows": "Data flows from inputs (numbers or byte strings) through conversion functions to produce transformed outputs. There are no external network or system command calls or data exfiltration points.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior is present. The functions perform standard data conversions, bit manipulations, and byte swaps. Cache dictionaries for bitwise operations are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code provides various utility functions for data conversion between integers, bits, and bytes, with cache optimizations for performance. No external inputs, network activity, or system commands are present. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are detected. Functions are well-documented and serve typical cryptographic or serialization purposes. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are identified. The code appears benign and intended for legitimate data handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code consists of standard utility functions for data conversion and manipulation, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications. Overall, it appears safe.",
