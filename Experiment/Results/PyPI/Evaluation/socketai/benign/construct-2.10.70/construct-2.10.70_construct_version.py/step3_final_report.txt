  "purpose": "Static metadata assignment for package version and release date.",
  "sources": "Variable assignments defining version tuple, version string, and release date string.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of dynamic code, inputs, or network activity; straightforward static data.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments with no functions, inputs, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify the code as benign metadata. No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, static declaration of version information and release date, with no security concerns or malicious intent. All reports and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
