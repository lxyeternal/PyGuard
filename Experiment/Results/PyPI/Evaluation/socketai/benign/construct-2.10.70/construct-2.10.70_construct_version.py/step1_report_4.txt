  "purpose": "Define version information and release date for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "Assignment of static values to variables: 'version', 'version_string', 'release_date'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; all values are hardcoded.",
  "anomalies": "All variables contain static, hardcoded values with no dynamic or external input; no suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns fixed tuples and strings to variables representing version info and release date. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are accessed. There are no functions, I/O operations, network connections, or code execution mechanisms present. The code appears to be standard metadata setup with no malicious intent or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving to store version and release date information. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected.",
