  "purpose": "Define version information and release date for a software package",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version tuple, version string, and release date string",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; static assignment only",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; all data is statically assigned constants with no dynamic or external input",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments with hardcoded strings and a tuple representing version information. There are no input operations, no data processing, no network activity, or code execution. It appears to be static metadata about a software release. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The variables are straightforward, and no security risks are associated with such static data assignments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as metadata for versioning and release date information. There are no signs of malicious activity or security concerns.",
