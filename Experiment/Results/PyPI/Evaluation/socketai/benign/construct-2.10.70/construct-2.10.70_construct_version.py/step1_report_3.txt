  "purpose": "Define version information and release date for a software package",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources; static variable assignments",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data leaks or untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; variables are statically assigned",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard variable assignments",
  "analysis": "The code assigns version information and release date as static variables. No external inputs, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious behavior observed. The data appears to be hardcoded metadata typical in package versioning. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code is minimal and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply sets version and release date information with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It is a standard practice for package metadata.",
