  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data handling or untrusted input",
  "flows": "No data flows; simple variable assignments",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward variable definitions with static data",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments defining version details and release date. There are no inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior. The variables are hardcoded, but that is typical for package metadata. No signs of malicious intent or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple metadata declaration with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
