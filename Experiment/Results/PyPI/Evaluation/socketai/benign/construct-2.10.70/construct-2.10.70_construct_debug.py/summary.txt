  "conclusion": "The code is a set of debugging utilities for inspecting stream and context data during parsing. It contains no malicious intent or behavior, and the observed security risk is minimal, primarily related to the potential misuse of debugging tools if exposed externally. The scores and assessments across reports are accurate and consistent."
