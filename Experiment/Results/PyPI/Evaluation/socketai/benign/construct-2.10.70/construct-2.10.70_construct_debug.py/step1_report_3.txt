{
  "purpose": "The code provides debugging and inspection tools for parsing and building binary data streams, primarily for debugging constructs within the construct library.",
  "sources": "Input streams for parsing (_parse method) and building (_build method); context data during parsing and building.",
  "sinks": "Printing output to standard output (print statements), which could be exploited if the code is modified to send data elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Input stream data is peeked at in the printout method (stream.read), and context data is printed directly; no external data flow or network activity observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of pdb.post_mortem for debugging, which is standard debugging practice, not malicious; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data manipulations detected. The code solely outputs debug info and exception traces.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes: Probe and Debugger. Probe outputs stream content and context for debugging purposes, while Debugger provides a PDB-based interactive debugger upon exceptions. Both classes utilize print statements for debugging output. No code writes data to external systems, performs network operations, or manipulates data in an insecure manner. The only potential concern is the use of pdb.post_mortem, which is a standard debugging tool but could be exploited if exposed externally; however, as implemented, it is limited to debugging sessions. There is no obfuscation, no malicious behavior, and no signs of malware. The code is intended for development use only, with no apparent malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely diagnostic and debugging tooling for the construct library, with no malicious behavior detected. It outputs internal debugging information via print and pdb, which could be misused if exposed in production, but does not contain malicious logic. The malware score is 0, security risk is low, and confidence in this assessment is high.",
