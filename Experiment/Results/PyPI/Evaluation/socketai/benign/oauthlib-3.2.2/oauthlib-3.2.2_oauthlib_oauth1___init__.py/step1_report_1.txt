{
  "purpose": "This module provides a wrapper for OAuth 1.0 Client and Server classes, facilitating OAuth 1.0 authentication flows.",
  "sources": "Imports from local package modules (.rfc5849 and submodules), which are standard for organizing package code.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or untrusted data handling observed; the code mainly imports classes and constants.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code only defines imports and does not process data at this stage.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscated code detected. The code appears straightforward and standard for a library wrapper.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various signature constants, endpoint classes, error classes, and a request validator from internal modules. There is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The structure is typical for a library module that sets up OAuth 1.0 components. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or data leaks are present. The code is clean and clearly organized, serving as a setup or interface layer for OAuth functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, non-malicious wrapper module for OAuth 1.0 implementations. It contains only import statements without any suspicious activity, backdoors, or security risks.",
