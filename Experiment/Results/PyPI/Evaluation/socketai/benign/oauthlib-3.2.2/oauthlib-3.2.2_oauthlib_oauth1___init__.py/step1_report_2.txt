  "purpose": "This module provides a wrapper for OAuth 1.0 client and server implementations, facilitating OAuth 1.0 protocol handling.",
  "sources": "Imports various constants, classes, and error definitions from internal submodules, including rfc5849 components and request validator.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed directly; no network connections, file operations, or data leaks are visible.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow identified within this code snippet; primarily imports and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code appears to be a straightforward module setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports constants, classes, and errors from internal modules related to OAuth 1.0 implementation. It serves as a wrapper or interface layer, with no data processing, user input handling, or network operations. Since it only imports components, it does not contain executable logic that could be malicious. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security issues in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard library module that sets up OAuth 1.0 functionality. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks within this snippet. It is a safe and typical component for an OAuth library.",
