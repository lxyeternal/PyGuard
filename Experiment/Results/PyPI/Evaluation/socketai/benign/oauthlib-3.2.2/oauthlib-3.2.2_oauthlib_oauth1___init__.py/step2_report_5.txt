  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the logic, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is a straightforward module that imports various constants, classes, and errors from internal submodules related to OAuth 1.0.\n- There are no dynamic behaviors, data processing, network operations, or user input handling.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n- The code serves as a wrapper or interface layer, which is typical in library modules.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Assessment:** No issues, standard library setup.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Justification:** Correct; no malicious activity or security risk.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, no issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Justification:** Correct; the code is a safe import module.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Justification:** Correct.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, no issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Justification:** Correct.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, standard import setup.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Justification:** Correct.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n**However,** considering the scores are all zero and the code is purely import statements, I agree with the assessments. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a standard, benign library setup with no security concerns. The reports are consistent with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If future code snippets include dynamic behaviors, user input handling, or network operations, reassessment would be necessary.",
