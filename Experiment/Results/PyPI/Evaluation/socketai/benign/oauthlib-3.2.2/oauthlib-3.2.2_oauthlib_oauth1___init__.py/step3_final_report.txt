  "purpose": "This module serves as a wrapper or interface for OAuth 1.0 Client and Server classes, importing constants, classes, and error definitions from internal submodules.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules, including constants, classes, and error definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data output.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only static import statements without dynamic execution or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and purely import-based.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static module that imports various components related to OAuth 1.0. It contains no executable logic, data processing, network activity, or dynamic behavior. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code. The code functions as a library setup layer, which is typical and benign. Given the absence of any suspicious patterns, malicious activity, or vulnerabilities, the code is considered safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard library wrapper with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and justified based on the code content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
