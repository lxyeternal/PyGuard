  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the evidence presented and the logical consistency of their conclusions.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a set of import statements for internal modules related to OAuth 1.0.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling is mentioned.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code appears to be a straightforward wrapper or interface layer, typical for a library setup.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** None of the reports identify any actual vulnerabilities, malicious code, or security flaws. They all agree that the code is benign, consisting solely of import statements and documentation.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- **Analysis correctness:** The reports correctly interpret the code as a non-executable, structural setup module. No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n- **Potential oversight:** Since the code is purely import statements, the risk of malicious activity is inherently low, which the reports acknowledge.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated code:** All assign 0, consistent with straightforward import statements.\n- **Security risk:** All assign 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n### Risk scores:\n- The reports assign a security risk of 0, which is justified given the code's nature.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments needed based on the provided information.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall conclusion:** The code is a benign, standard library module setup with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code contains only import statements for internal OAuth 1.0 components.\n- No malicious activity, backdoors, or vulnerabilities are present.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as-is.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the scores at malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. The code is safe.",
