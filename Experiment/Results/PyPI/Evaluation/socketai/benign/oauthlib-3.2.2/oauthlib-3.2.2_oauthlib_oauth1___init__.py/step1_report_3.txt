{
  "purpose": "This module provides a wrapper for OAuth 1.0 Client and Server classes, facilitating OAuth 1.0 authentication processes.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules: rfc5849, rfc5849.endpoints, rfc5849.errors, rfc5849.request_validator.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; the code mainly imports classes and constants for OAuth implementation, with no direct handling of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis applicable as this code only contains import statements and module-level docstring, with no runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behavior detected. The code is straightforward, importing OAuth components.",
  "analysis": "The code is a module-level wrapper that imports OAuth 1.0 components, endpoints, error classes, and request validators from internal submodules. There are no executable statements, data processing, or dynamic behaviors. The structure appears standard for a library setup, with no signs of malicious logic, code injection, or obfuscated code. The absence of data handling, user input processing, or network activity indicates low risk.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, non-malicious wrapper module for OAuth 1.0 functionalities. It only imports necessary components without executing or handling data that could be malicious. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
