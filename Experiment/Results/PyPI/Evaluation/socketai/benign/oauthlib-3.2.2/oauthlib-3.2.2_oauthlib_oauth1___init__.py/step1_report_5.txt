  "purpose": "This module serves as a wrapper for OAuth 1.0 Client and Server classes, providing constants and importing core components for OAuth 1.0 protocol implementation.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: .rfc5849 and its submodules for constants, classes, and errors.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external communication is visible in this fragment.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks within this code fragment; it only imports modules and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is a straightforward import setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various constants, classes, and error types from internal modules related to OAuth 1.0 implementation. It appears to be a standard wrapper or facade pattern, with no dynamic code execution, network operations, or secret handling shown. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are detected in this import structure.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module setup that imports necessary OAuth 1.0 protocol components for use elsewhere. It does not contain malicious code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors. It appears to be a safe and standard implementation pattern.",
