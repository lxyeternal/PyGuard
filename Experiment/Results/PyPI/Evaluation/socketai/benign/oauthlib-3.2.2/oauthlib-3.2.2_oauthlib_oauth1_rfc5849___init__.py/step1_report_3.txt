{
  "purpose": "Implementation of OAuth 1.0 RFC 5849 request signing and validation logic.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as request URI, headers, body, client credentials, and optional nonce/timestamp values; environment variables are not used.",
  "sinks": "Signature generation functions, hashing functions, network communication (implied in OAuth flow, not explicitly present), and potential logging outputs.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed to generate OAuth signatures, with data flow from request input through signature computation to headers and request signing outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials. Use of standard libraries for hashing and encoding is benign. Logging debug info could leak sensitive data in logs; no other suspicious or unusual code patterns are present. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements OAuth 1.0 signing with support for multiple signature methods, including SHA-1, SHA-256, and RSA variants. It carefully manages OAuth parameter collection, signature base string construction, and request signing. It uses standard cryptographic libraries and safe handling of inputs. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden functionalities. Logging of sensitive data could be a privacy concern but not malicious. Overall, the code appears to be a standard OAuth signing library with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard OAuth 1.0 request signing implementation without any signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It adheres to typical cryptographic and OAuth protocol practices. No indicators of malware or security risks are evident.",
