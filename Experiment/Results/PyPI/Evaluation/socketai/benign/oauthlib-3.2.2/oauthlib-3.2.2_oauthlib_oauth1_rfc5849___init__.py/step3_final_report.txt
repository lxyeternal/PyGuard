  "purpose": "Implementation of OAuth 1.0 request signing supporting multiple signature methods including HMAC and RSA variants, with parameter handling and request construction.",
  "sources": "Request data (uri, headers, body), OAuth parameters (nonce, timestamp, secrets), cryptographic functions for signature generation.",
  "sinks": "Signature generation functions, request headers and URI modifications, cryptographic digest computations.",
  "flows": "Input request data -> parameter collection and normalization -> signature base string creation -> signature computation -> request signing and rendering.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious code patterns. Logging could potentially leak sensitive info but is standard for debugging.",
  "analysis": "The code adheres to OAuth 1.0 specifications, employs standard cryptographic libraries, and manages parameters securely. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The signature methods support modern algorithms, and the structure is clear. Logging practices are typical and do not indicate malicious intent. The low malware score (0), no obfuscation (0), and minimal security risk (~0.1-0.2) are justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure OAuth 1.0 signing implementation with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
