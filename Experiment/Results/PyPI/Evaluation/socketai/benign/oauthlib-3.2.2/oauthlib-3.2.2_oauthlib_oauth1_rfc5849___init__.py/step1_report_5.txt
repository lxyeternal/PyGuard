  "sources": [
    "Imports of standard libraries: base64, hashlib, logging, urllib.parse",
    "Imported functions from oauthlib.common",
    "Signature methods from local signature module",
    "Initialization of Client class parameters and internal state"
  ],
  "sinks": [
    "Signature generation via signature methods (e.g., sign_hmac_sha1_with_client)",
    "Encoding and decoding of request data and headers",
    "Generation of OAuth parameters including nonce, timestamp, and body hash",
    "Construction of OAuth-signed request URI, headers, and body"
  ],
  "flows": [
    "Input parameters (client_key, secrets, nonce, timestamp, etc.) → stored in object",
    "get_oauth_signature() → collects parameters, normalizes, creates signature base string → signs via signature method → returns signature",
    "sign() → prepares request, adds OAuth params, generates signature, renders final request"
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "Use of non-standard signature methods (e.g., HMAC-SHA256, RSA-SHA256, SHA512 variants) but not inherently suspicious",
    "Encoding and decoding steps are thorough, with optional custom encoding",
    "No hardcoded credentials or secrets observed",
    "Signature methods registered dynamically, allowing for extension",
    "Potential for test overrides via nonce and timestamp parameters, but no malicious intent evident",
    "No suspicious code constructs, obfuscated logic, or hidden behaviors detected"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code implements an OAuth 1.0 request signing client with support for multiple signature methods, including newer SHA256 variants. It handles parameter collection, normalization, signature base string creation, and request signing in a standard manner. The inclusion of optional nonces and timestamps supports test scenarios. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. All encoding, request preparation, and signing logic follow typical OAuth patterns without anomalies or suspicious constructs. The code appears well-structured for legitimate OAuth signing purposes, with no signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard OAuth 1.0 request signing implementation. It correctly handles signature creation, parameter management, and request rendering. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. Its design aligns with common OAuth client libraries, with support for modern signature algorithms.",
