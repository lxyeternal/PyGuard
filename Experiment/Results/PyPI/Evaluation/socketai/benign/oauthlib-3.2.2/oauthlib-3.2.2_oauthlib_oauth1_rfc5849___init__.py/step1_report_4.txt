{
  "purpose": "This module implements OAuth 1.0 request signing and verification logic, supporting multiple signature methods and request types.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include request.uri, request.headers, request.body, and optional parameters such as nonce, timestamp, and RSA keys.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include signature computation functions, HTTP request construction (headers, URI, body), and cryptographic operations that process sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (URI, headers, body, secrets) through signature generation and parameter normalization, ultimately producing signed request components (URI, headers, body).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures detected. Use of standard cryptographic libraries and normal OAuth flows. No obfuscated or malicious code identified.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard OAuth 1.0 client implementation. It handles signature generation with multiple algorithms, supports different signature placements, and manages OAuth parameters securely. No signs of malicious behaviors such as network data exfiltration, backdoors, or sabotage. Logging is present but not suspicious. No hardcoded secrets are evident. The use of cryptographic functions and parameter handling aligns with expected secure OAuth client design.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate OAuth 1.0 client implementation with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It follows standard protocols and practices for signing and preparing OAuth requests.",
