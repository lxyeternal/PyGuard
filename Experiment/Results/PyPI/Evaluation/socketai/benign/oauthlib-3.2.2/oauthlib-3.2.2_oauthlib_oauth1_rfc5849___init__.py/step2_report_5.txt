  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code implements OAuth 1.0 signing, supports multiple signature methods, handles parameters securely, and does not contain malicious behaviors.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — low, considering the code's standard nature.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high confidence in the assessment.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion is consistent with the code. No issues found. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on standard signing procedures, cryptographic correctness, and no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — very low.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is sound. No issues. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard OAuth signing, no hardcoded secrets, no malicious behaviors, logging is for debugging.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — low, considering potential logging of sensitive data, but no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate. No changes.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Implements OAuth 1.0 signing, supports multiple algorithms, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the code.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Details the implementation, supports newer algorithms, no malicious behavior, well-structured.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate, no issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Scores consistency:** All malware scores are 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly low but reasonable, reflecting the standard implementation with minimal risk.\n- **Obfuscation:** Correctly identified as absent.\n- **Potential concerns:** The only minor point is the logging of debug info that could expose sensitive data; however, this is typical for debugging and not malicious.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk scores:** Given the code's standard and secure implementation, I would suggest a slightly conservative overall risk score of **0.1 to 0.2**, reflecting minimal inherent risk.\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — standard, well-structured OAuth signing code with negligible security concerns.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears secure, standard, and free of malicious intent. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.",
