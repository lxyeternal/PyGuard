  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and assess the scores:\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes utility functions for OAuth, URL encoding/decoding, nonce/token generation, request representation, and case-insensitive dicts. Sources include request data, environment variables, cryptographic keys.\n\n- **Sinks:** JWT encode/decode, URL parsing, string comparison, random token/nonce generation.\n\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** Standard flows; no suspicious external calls or data leaks. Use of 'jwt' with external keys is expected in OAuth.\n\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malware or malicious behavior. The code is a standard OAuth utility library. The security risk is low (0.2), and malware score is 0.\n\n- **Score suggestion:** The scores seem reasonable. The risk is low, malware is zero, and obfuscated is zero.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing JWT signing/verification, token generation, and request handling.\n\n- **Anomalies:** Dynamic import of 'jwt' and token handling, but no malicious intent. The functions are standard.\n\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior; the code is typical OAuth utility code.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware is 0, security risk is 0.2, which aligns with the content.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Focuses on utility functions, secure token and nonce generation, JWT handling, sanitization, and timing attack mitigation.\n\n- **Analysis:** No backdoors or malicious code. Use of secure random, sanitization, and proper JWT handling.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard OAuth utility code. Malware score remains 0.\n\n- **Scores:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Emphasizes URL encoding/decoding, token generation, request processing, and sanitization.\n\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behaviors or obfuscation. Proper security practices observed.\n\n- **Scores:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Describes utility functions, secure token generation, JWT handling, sanitization, and timing attack resistance.\n\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. Uses cryptographically secure methods.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The code is a standard, secure OAuth utility module. Malware score is 0, risk is very low (0.1).\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports consistently assign 0, which aligns with the code's content—no malicious payloads, no network activity, no obfuscated code.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code's clarity.\n\n- **Risk score:** Slightly varied but generally low (0.1 to 0.2). The code is a utility library with no evident vulnerabilities, so these are reasonable.\n\n### Overall:\n\n- The code appears to be a legitimate, well-implemented OAuth utility library.\n- No signs of supply chain compromise, malicious code, or backdoors.\n- The scores are consistent with the content and analysis.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal risk, primarily related to external key management, which is outside the scope of this code.\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated content. The existing scores are appropriate and justified.",
