  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, reasoning, and scores.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report concludes that the code is legitimate, with no signs of malware or malicious behavior. It highlights standard practices like secure token generation, JWT handling, sanitization, and input validation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0 — consistent with the analysis.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious logic detected. The use of external cryptographic keys is standard and expected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard OAuth utilities, secure nonce/token generation, and JWT usage. No malicious intent or behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0 — consistent.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious code, and the functions are typical for OAuth implementations.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, standard OAuth utility functions with proper security practices. No malicious payloads or backdoors.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The code is standard, with no suspicious patterns.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Continues the pattern of standard OAuth utility code, with secure token and nonce generation, sanitization, and JWT handling. No malicious behaviors observed.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0 — aligned.\n- **Justification:** No malicious logic or obfuscation.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion—standard OAuth utility functions with proper security measures. No signs of malware or sabotage.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.1, obfuscated=0 — reasonable.\n- **Justification:** The low risk score reflects the benign nature, and malware remains at 0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code being standard OAuth utility functions without malicious payloads.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports are 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slight variation, but generally low (0.1-0.2), reflecting the benign assessment.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The code is a typical OAuth utility library, with functions for URL encoding/decoding, token and nonce generation, JWT signing/verification, and request handling.\n- No hardcoded secrets, no network activity, no backdoors, no obfuscated code.\n- The use of external keys for JWT is standard practice; the security depends on key management outside this code.\n- The sanitization and timing-attack resistant comparisons are good security practices.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, given the benign nature, but minor risks could be related to key management outside this code.\n\n**Therefore, my estimated scores are:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThe reports are consistent, and the code appears safe for use in OAuth implementations.",
