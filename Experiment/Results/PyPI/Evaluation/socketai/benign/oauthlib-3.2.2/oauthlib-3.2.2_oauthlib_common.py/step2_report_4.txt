  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report to determine if the issues, risks, and scores are appropriate, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** The code is a standard OAuth utility library with URL encoding/decoding, nonce/token generation, JWT signing/verification, and request handling. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or suspicious code detected. Proper sanitization and secure random functions are used. External keys are expected to be managed securely outside this code.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis; no malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — low, considering the code's utility nature and absence of evident vulnerabilities.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No issues with the scores; they are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, standard OAuth utilities with JWT handling, secure token and nonce generation, and input sanitization. No signs of malicious intent. The dynamic import of 'jwt' is unconventional but not malicious.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent with the lack of malicious activity.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — appropriate for a utility library with no evident vulnerabilities.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The scores seem justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Again, standard OAuth utility functions, secure token generation, JWT handling, sanitization, and no malicious behavior. The code is well-structured, with security best practices.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malware signals.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — reasonable, given the nature of the code.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is valid; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Utility functions for OAuth, including secure token generation, JWT handling, sanitization, and timing-attack resistant comparisons. No malicious behaviors or backdoors detected.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning and scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to others—standard OAuth utilities with secure practices, no malicious activity, and proper sanitization.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — very low, as expected.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis supports the scores.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, indicating no malicious activity across all reports. The code is standard OAuth utility code.\n\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, no obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Risk scores:** Ranging from 0.1 to 0.2, which are appropriate given the utility nature and the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code does not contain any signs of malware, sabotage, or backdoors.\n- The cryptographic practices (JWT signing, secure random token generation) are standard and correctly implemented.\n- Input sanitization and constant-time comparison mitigate common security issues.\n- No suspicious external network activity, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are present.\n- The scores assigned in each report are reasonable and justified based on the analysis.\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (consistent with the reports)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code appears safe and well-implemented for its purpose.",
