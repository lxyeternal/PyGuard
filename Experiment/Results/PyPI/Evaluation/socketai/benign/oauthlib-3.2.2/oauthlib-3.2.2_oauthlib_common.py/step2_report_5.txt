  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a standard OAuth utility library, handling URL encoding/decoding, nonce/token generation, JWT signing/verification, and request representation. No malicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are detected. Proper sanitization and secure random functions are used.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code appears legitimate and secure. The low risk score aligns with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on JWT functions and secure token generation. No signs of malicious behavior; the code is standard OAuth utility code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable. The use of JWT functions is typical, and no malicious activity is implied.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, standard OAuth utilities, secure token and nonce generation, sanitization, and JWT handling. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors. The code is straightforward.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is appropriate; no malicious signals detected.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports, with focus on secure practices, sanitization, and JWT handling. No suspicious activity or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a utility module with secure token generation, URL handling, JWT signing/verification, and timing-attack resistant comparisons. No malicious behaviors or backdoors are detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Assessment:** The low risk score reflects the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or sabotage. The consistent zero malware score is justified.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation is evident; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** The highest risk score among reports is 0.2, which seems appropriate given the functions involve cryptographic operations and token handling, but these are standard and do not pose an immediate security threat.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Code is clear and readable.\n- **Risk:** **0.2** — Slightly elevated due to cryptographic functions, but overall low risk given proper key management outside this code.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears to be a legitimate, well-implemented OAuth utility library with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.",
