  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for OAuth, including URL encoding/decoding, nonce/token generation, JWT signing/verification, and request handling.",
  "sources": "Request data (uri, headers, body), environment variables (cryptographic keys), input parameters.",
  "sinks": "JWT encode/decode, URL parsing, string comparison, cryptographic functions, network communication (via JWT), random token generation.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through sanitization, encoding, and cryptographic functions; JWT signing/verification uses external keys; token and nonce generation use secure random functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code detected; standard practices observed; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard OAuth utility library implementing URL encoding/decoding, secure token and nonce generation, JWT handling, and request abstraction. It employs cryptographically secure random functions, sanitizes inputs, and uses timing-attack resistant comparisons. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The use of external keys for JWT signing is typical and outside the scope of this code. The overall structure and practices align with secure OAuth implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure OAuth utility module with no signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation. The scores are consistent with the content, indicating no malware (0), no obfuscation (0), and a very low security risk (~0.1-0.2). It is safe for use in production environments.",
