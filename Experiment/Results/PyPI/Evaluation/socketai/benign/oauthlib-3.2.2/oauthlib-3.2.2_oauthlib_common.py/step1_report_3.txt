  "purpose": "Provides utility functions and classes for handling OAuth data structures, encoding, decoding, token generation, and request management in OAuth implementations.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (via import), generates random tokens/nonces, decodes and encodes URL parameters, extracts parameters from input, reads request data (uri, headers, body).",
  "sinks": "JWT encoding/decoding functions, nonce/token generation, request attribute access, URL modifications, string comparison, logging, regular expression sanitization.",
  "flows": "Input data (environment variables, request data, parameters) -> token/nonce generation or parameter extraction -> JWT operations or URL manipulations -> comparison functions or sanitization.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic imports for jwt; potential exposure of private keys via JWT encoding; generation of random tokens/nonces using SystemRandom, which is secure; sanitization pattern for passwords/tokens; no evident hardcoded secrets; regular expression for sanitization is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly offers utility functions for OAuth workflows, including token generation, URL encoding/decoding, parameter extraction, and request modeling. It uses secure random functions for token and nonce generation, proper JWT handling, and case-insensitive dictionary for headers or parameters. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network connections are evident. The JWT functions handle signing and verification correctly, and the request class carefully sanitizes sensitive information during representation. Regular expressions used for sanitization are simple and do not obfuscate malicious code. Overall, the code appears to be standard OAuth utility code with no malicious intent or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of OAuth utility functions and classes intended for secure handling of tokens, request data, and URL parameters. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware signals are present. The implementation aligns with standard OAuth practices, with no signs of malicious code or supply chain attacks.",
