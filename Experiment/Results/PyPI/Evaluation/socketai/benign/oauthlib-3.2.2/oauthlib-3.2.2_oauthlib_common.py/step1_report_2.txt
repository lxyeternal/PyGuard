{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions and data structures for handling OAuth-related data, encoding, decoding, request handling, and token generation.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from request bodies, headers, URL query strings, and environment variables; accesses modules like 'jwt' and 'time'.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'jwt.encode' and 'jwt.decode' for token signing and verification; possibly generates tokens and nonces; manipulates URL query strings and headers.",
  "flows": "Input data (request body, headers, URL parameters) flows through decoding and processing functions; signing and verifying tokens via jwt functions; generated tokens and nonces flow into OAuth request/response processes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'jwt' without explicit verification of token origin or validation, which could be risky if misused; dynamic import of 'jwt' inside functions; potential absence of strict validation on tokens; no evident hardcoded secrets, but presence of token signing/verification functions warrants caution.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard OAuth utility functions including nonce and token generation, URL encoding/decoding, and request modeling. The 'generate_signed_token' and 'verify_signed_token' functions use 'jwt' for token handling, which is common but requires correct validation. The dynamic import of 'jwt' inside functions is unconventional but not inherently malicious. The token generation employs SystemRandom, which is secure. No hardcoded secrets are evident. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code's use of 'jwt' and request handling functions could be misused if integrated improperly but are not malicious by themselves.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard OAuth utility code with no signs of malicious intent. It implements common security practices such as secure nonce and token generation, case-insensitive headers, and input validation. There is no evidence of backdoors, hidden malicious behaviors, or suspicious data leaks. The use of 'jwt' functions necessitates proper validation in actual use, but the code itself is benign.",
