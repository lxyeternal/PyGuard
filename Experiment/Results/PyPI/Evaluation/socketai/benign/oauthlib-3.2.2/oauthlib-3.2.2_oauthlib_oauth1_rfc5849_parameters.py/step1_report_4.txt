  "purpose": "This module provides methods to prepare OAuth 1.0a protocol parameters into HTTP headers, form bodies, and URL query strings for OAuth 1.0a authorization requests.",
  "sources": "Reads OAuth parameters, headers, and URI components; extracts query parameters from URLs.",
  "sinks": "Constructs OAuth Authorization headers, appends OAuth parameters to URL query strings and request bodies.",
  "flows": "OAuth parameters are taken as input, potentially escaped, then integrated into headers, form bodies, or URLs, with no external untrusted input directly influencing critical security-sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code performs standard OAuth parameter formatting and URL manipulation without any obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard OAuth header and URL parameter preparations, including escaping parameter values, appending OAuth parameters, and constructing headers and URL query strings. The functions rely on existing safe utility functions for escaping and URL encoding. There is no evidence of malicious code, data leakage, or suspicious behavior. The code is well-structured, adheres to OAuth specifications, and handles data securely. There are no hardcoded secrets, network connections, or data exfiltration mechanisms observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of OAuth parameter formatting and request preparation routines. It does not contain malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or security risks. The likelihood of malicious intent is very low.",
