{
  "purpose": "The code provides methods for preparing OAuth 1.0a authorization headers, request bodies, and query parameters according to the OAuth specification.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters such as oauth_params, headers, body, and URI components. It also uses utility functions like extract_params and urlencode.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the construction of the 'Authorization' header, URL query strings, and form-encoded bodies which could be used to inject malicious data into HTTP requests.",
  "flows": "OAuth parameters are processed and encoded, then inserted into headers, URL query strings, or request bodies. There are no direct data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks in this snippet, but the processed parameters could be malicious if supplied by an attacker.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code, are present. The code relies on standard OAuth parameter handling and URL encoding functions.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly adheres to OAuth 1.0a specification for preparing authorization headers, URL parameters, and bodies. It encodes and escapes parameters to prevent injection issues. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or harmful operations. The functions operate on supplied parameters without any suspicious external data sources or insecure practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of OAuth parameter preparation functions with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It processes input data in accordance with the OAuth specs and does not contain malware. It is safe for use provided the inputs are as expected.",
