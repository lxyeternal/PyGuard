  "purpose": "Provides functions to prepare OAuth 1.0a authorization headers, URL query parameters, and request bodies, following OAuth specifications.",
  "sources": "oauth_params input, headers argument, uri argument, body argument, external utils functions (extract_params, urlencode, utils.escape).",
  "sinks": "Constructed headers ('Authorization'), URL query string, and request body with OAuth parameters.",
  "flows": "OAuth parameters are encoded and escaped, then assembled into headers, URL query, or body, depending on function.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Dependency on external utils functions is noted but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly implements OAuth 1.0a parameter handling, encoding, and header/url construction. It relies on external utility functions assumed safe. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The functions follow OAuth specifications, and the logic is straightforward. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are justified given the code's nature and external dependencies. No further security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, compliant implementation of OAuth 1.0a request preparation routines. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
