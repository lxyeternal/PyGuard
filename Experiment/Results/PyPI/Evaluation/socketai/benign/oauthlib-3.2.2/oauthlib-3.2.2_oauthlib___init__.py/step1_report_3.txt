{
  "purpose": "The code provides logging configuration and debug mode control for the oauthlib package, implementing OAuth request-signing logic.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only manipulates internal variables and logging configurations.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data flows into sensitive operations or external systems.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present; the functions modify and retrieve the debug flag without external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a module for OAuthlib with standard logging setup, a global debug flag, and functions to set and get this flag. No external input, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code is clean, well-structured, and does not perform any harmful operations or data manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard and safe, solely managing logging and debug flags with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
