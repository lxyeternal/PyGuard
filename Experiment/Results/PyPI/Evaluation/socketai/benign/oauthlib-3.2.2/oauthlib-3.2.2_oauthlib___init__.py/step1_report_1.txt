{
  "purpose": "The code provides a basic setup for an OAuthlib implementation with logging configuration and debug mode control functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the import statements and the `set_debug` function parameter.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data leads to security risks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user-controlled input via the `set_debug` function to the global `_DEBUG` variable.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. No obfuscated or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes logging with a NullHandler to prevent logging errors if no handlers are set. It defines functions to set and get a debug flag stored in a global variable. There are no external data inputs, untrusted data processing, or dangerous operations. The code appears to be standard configuration and utility functions without any malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple setup for logging and debug configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
