  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Imports logging, sets up a NullHandler for 'oauthlib' logger.\n- Defines a global `_DEBUG` variable.\n- Provides `set_debug()` to modify `_DEBUG`.\n- Provides `get_debug()` to retrieve `_DEBUG`.\n- No external input, no data processing, no network operations, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- The code is minimal, straightforward, and primarily configuration.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  The reports correctly identify that the code is a simple configuration module with no malicious or security-sensitive operations. No issues such as hardcoded secrets, external data handling, or obfuscation are present.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly interpret the code's purpose and scope.\n\n- **Scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, securityRisk)?**  \n  All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, and securityRisk as 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Analysis:\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  The code does not perform any malicious actions—no code injection, no external data processing, no network activity, no suspicious behavior. The malware score of 0 in all reports is appropriate.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  The code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated. The obfuscated score of 0 is correct.\n\n- **Security Risk Score:**  \n  Given the code's minimal and safe nature, a security risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n- **Flow and Data Handling:**  \n  The only data flow is from function parameters to a global variable and vice versa, which is benign.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:**  \n  No assumptions are made that could lead to vulnerabilities. The code is purely configuration.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No changes needed in their scores or conclusions.\n- The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis: the code is a simple, safe configuration utility with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports correctly identify that this code is safe, non-malicious, and not obfuscated. No security risks are present. The assigned scores are appropriate, and I agree with their conclusions.",
