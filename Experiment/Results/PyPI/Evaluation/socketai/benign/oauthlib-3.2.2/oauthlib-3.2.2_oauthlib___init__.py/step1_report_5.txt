{
  "purpose": "Provides a minimal logging setup and functions to control debug mode for the OAuthlib library.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters in set_debug() and get_debug().",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data outputs are present in the code.",
  "flows": "User calls set_debug() to modify the internal _DEBUG variable; get_debug() retrieves its value.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, with standard logging configuration and simple getter/setter functions.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes logging with a NullHandler to suppress logging output, defines a debug flag, and provides functions to set and get its value. There are no external data inputs, no untrusted data handling, and no code that executes external commands or network operations. The functions are simple state toggles with no hidden or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration snippet for logging and debug mode control within a library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks.",
