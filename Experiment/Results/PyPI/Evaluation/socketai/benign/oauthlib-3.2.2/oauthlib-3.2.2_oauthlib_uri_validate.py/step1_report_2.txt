{
  "purpose": "Define comprehensive regular expressions for matching and validating URIs based on RFC3986 standards.",
  "sources": "The code defines regex patterns and functions that match URI components and entire URIs, primarily in the functions is_uri, is_uri_reference, and is_absolute_uri.",
  "sinks": "The functions use re.match to evaluate whether input strings conform to URI patterns, which could potentially be used to validate untrusted input in applications.",
  "flows": "Input strings are passed to is_uri, is_uri_reference, or is_absolute_uri functions, which perform regex matching to validate if the input is a URI or related reference.",
  "anomalies": "The code relies on complex, verbose regex patterns for URI validation but does not perform any data processing, network communication, or data storage. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious constructs are evident. The regex patterns are derived from RFC standards and do not involve obfuscation or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script defines multiple regex components for URI validation, including schemes, authorities, paths, queries, and fragments. The functions encapsulate regex matches to determine URI validity. The code appears to be a well-structured, standard implementation of URI validation regex patterns with no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities. It only performs pattern matching without side effects or external interactions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-documented implementation of URI validation using regex patterns. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected. The functions are limited to pattern matching for input validation and do not include any suspicious or harmful operations.",
