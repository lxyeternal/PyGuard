{
  "purpose": "The code provides regex patterns for validating and parsing URIs according to RFC standards, primarily for use in URL validation and processing.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from string constants and regex patterns; no input reading functions are present.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network connections, file writes, or command executions are present in this code.",
  "flows": "The functions perform pattern matching of input URI strings against regex patterns to validate their structure.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not include any anomalies, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors. It is a straightforward regex-based URI validation module.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple regex components to match parts of URIs according to RFC 3986, including schemes, authorities, paths, queries, and fragments. It uses string interpolation and regex compilation via re.match for validation. The code is well-structured and intended for URI pattern matching; no external data sources or outputs are evident. There are no suspicious behaviors such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code execution. It appears purely for pattern validation. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard URI regex validation utility, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as intended for URI validation without executing external or unsafe actions.",
