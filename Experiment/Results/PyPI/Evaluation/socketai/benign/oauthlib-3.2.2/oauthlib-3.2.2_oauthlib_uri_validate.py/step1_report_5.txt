  "purpose": "This code provides a set of regular expressions for parsing and validating URIs based on RFC standards, with functions to check if strings match URI patterns.",
  "sources": "Constants defining URI components (e.g., DIGIT, ALPHA, HEXDIG), regex pattern definitions, functions is_uri, is_uri_reference, is_absolute_uri.",
  "sinks": "None; the functions return match objects and do not process untrusted data further or execute code based on input.",
  "flows": "Input string is matched against regex patterns in functions; no data is processed or transmitted; no flow leads to untrusted data execution.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to be a standard regex-based URI validator. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present. Regex patterns are comprehensive but standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines detailed regex patterns for URI components according to RFC standards, intended for validating URI strings. No dynamic evaluation, external data processing, or dangerous behavior is present. Functions are simple wrappers around regex matching. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected. The patterns are static and well-structured, with no obfuscation or hidden logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of URI validation using regular expressions. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no malware, and poses no security risks. It is a safe, non-obfuscated validator module.",
