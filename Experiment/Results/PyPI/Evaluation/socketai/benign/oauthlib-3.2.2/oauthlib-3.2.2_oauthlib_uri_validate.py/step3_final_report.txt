{
  "purpose": "This code provides regex patterns derived from RFC standards for validating URIs, including components like scheme, authority, path, query, and fragment, and functions to match URIs against these patterns.",
  "sources": "The functions 'is_uri', 'is_uri_reference', and 'is_absolute_uri' accept URI strings as input for pattern matching.",
  "sinks": "The code only performs regex matching; no data is written to external systems, files, or network, and no untrusted data is executed or evaluated beyond pattern matching.",
  "flows": "Input URI strings are passed to match functions which compare against static regex patterns derived from RFCs; no further data flow or processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The code is static, straightforward, and based on RFC standards. No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines regex patterns for URI components and validation functions using re.match with VERBOSE flag. It is solely pattern matching based on RFC specifications, with no external data handling, network operations, or code execution. The regex patterns are static and well-documented. The functions return match objects if the input conforms to the patterns, serving as validation checks. No malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code's purpose is to validate URIs, which it does safely and correctly. The lack of dynamic behavior or side effects indicates a benign utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, RFC-compliant URI validation utility implemented via static regex patterns. It performs no malicious actions, contains no obfuscation, and poses negligible security risks. The functions are safe for use in supply chain contexts, and the overall assessment indicates a non-malicious, benign utility.",
