  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes regex patterns derived from RFC standards for URI validation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uses re.match in functions that accept untrusted input, but this is standard for validation.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The regex is static and based on RFCs.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, with high confidence (0.9). No malware, obfuscation, or security risks noted.\n- **Risk Score Justification:** The risk score is 0.1, which seems reasonable given the code's purpose and lack of malicious activity.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, describing regex patterns for URI validation based on RFC standards.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, straightforward pattern matching.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9, which aligns with the assessment.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1, appropriate for such a validation utility.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on defining regex for URI components, with functions for validation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious intent or security issues. Pure pattern matching.\n- **Confidence:** 1, indicating high certainty.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, which is reasonable.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Describes regex patterns for URI validation, no external data or side effects.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar to others, standard regex patterns for URI validation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate the code is purely regex-based URI validation with no malicious intent. The malware score should be **0**.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is straightforward, well-documented, and based on RFC standards. No obfuscation detected; score should be **0**.\n- **Risk Score:** Since the code only performs pattern matching for validation, the risk is minimal. The scores of 0.1 or 0 are appropriate.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a standard, RFC-compliant URI validation utility.\n- No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious logic is present.\n- The functions are simple and only perform regex matching, which is safe if used correctly.\n- The low risk scores reflect the utility's benign nature.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (consistent with the reports, perhaps slightly higher if considering potential misuse, but still very low)\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, standard, and non-malicious. The provided scores are reasonable and justified.",
