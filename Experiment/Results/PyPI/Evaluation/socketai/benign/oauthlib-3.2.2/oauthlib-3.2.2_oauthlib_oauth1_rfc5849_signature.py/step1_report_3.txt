{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for constructing OAuth 1.0a signature base strings, normalizing parameters, and signing/verifying requests using various algorithms (HMAC, RSA, plaintext) as part of OAuth 1.0a request signing and verification.",
  "sources": "Inputs from request parameters, headers, URI query strings, body content, and supplied credentials (client secrets, RSA keys).",
  "sinks": "Signature verification functions, base64 encoding/decoding, cryptographic signing and verification, logging outputs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from inputs (parameters, headers, URI), through normalization and signature base string creation, into signing/verifying functions, and finally to output verification results or signatures.",
  "anomalies": "Use of warnings.warn for deprecated functions, lack of explicit input validation for some parameters (e.g., client secrets or keys), reliance on external libraries (jwt) without internal validation, no evident obfuscation or unusual constructs, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, no network or system commands, no data leakage or suspicious behavior in the code provided.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly implements OAuth 1.0a signature generation and verification processes. It handles various signature methods (HMAC-SHA1, SHA-256, SHA-512, RSA variants, and plaintext). All cryptographic functions utilize standard libraries and proper encoding practices. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as hidden network activity, data exfiltration, or sabotage. The only notable aspect is the use of deprecation warnings for internal functions, which is typical for maintenance. The code does not process untrusted data in unsafe ways beyond standard OAuth parameter handling, and all cryptographic operations appear to follow best practices. No anomalies indicative of malicious intent or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of OAuth 1.0a signature mechanisms without any malicious or sabotage behavior. It is focused on cryptographic signing and verification according to RFC 5849 specifications. The code does not exhibit obfuscation or malware signatures, and no suspicious behaviors are evident.",
