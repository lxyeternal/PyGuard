  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code implements internal OAuth 1.0 signature functions as per RFC 5849, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or anomalies detected. The confidence is high (0.95), and malware risk is zero.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is thorough, focusing on cryptographic correctness, proper parameter handling, and absence of suspicious patterns. The use of standard libraries and internal functions aligns with secure practices.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 (negligible). These seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard implementation, correct cryptographic use, and no malicious behavior. Confidence is high (0.95), malware zero.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code. The RSA caching, key handling, and cryptographic operations are standard and safe.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1. Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the implementation of OAuth 1.0a signature processes, again noting no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns. High confidence (0.95), malware zero.\n\n- **Assessment:** The detailed reasoning matches the code's purpose and structure. No suspicious behaviors are evident.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1. Justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights standard OAuth 1.0 signature functions, no anomalies, no hardcoded secrets, no malicious activity. Slightly lower confidence (0.9), malware zero.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The code's cryptographic routines and parameter handling are standard.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2. Slightly higher risk, but still reasonable given the cryptographic focus and no suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Affirms that the code implements OAuth signature methods correctly, with no malicious or sabotage behavior, no obfuscation, and standard libraries. Highest confidence (1.0), malware zero.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is comprehensive, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1. Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code being a standard cryptographic implementation with no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** All are 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal security concern. Given the code's purpose and no suspicious patterns, these are reasonable.\n\n- **Potential Concerns:** No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code paths, no obfuscation, no external network activity, and cryptographic practices follow RFC specifications.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (minimal, standard cryptographic implementation)\n\n**My overall assessment:** The code is a standard, well-implemented OAuth 1.0 signature module with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Estimated Value |\n|----------------|-----------------|\n| Malware        | 0               |\n| Obfuscated     | 0               |\n| Risk           | 0.1             |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the security best practices observed.",
