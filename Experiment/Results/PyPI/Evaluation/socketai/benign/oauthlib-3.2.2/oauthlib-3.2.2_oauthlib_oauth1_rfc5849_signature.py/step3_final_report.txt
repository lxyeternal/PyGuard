{
  "purpose": "The code implements internal OAuth 1.0 signature creation and verification functions according to RFC 5849, handling parameter normalization, URI base string calculation, and cryptographic signing (HMAC and RSA) for OAuth requests.",
  "sources": "Request parameters from URL query, headers (authorization header), request body, and client credentials (secrets, keys).",
  "sinks": "Cryptographic functions (signing/verifying signatures), internal data flow; no external network activity or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input data (parameters, URI, credentials) are processed through normalization, encoding, and cryptographic signing/verifying functions, with no external data or network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Use of warnings for deprecated functions is standard maintenance practice.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly follows RFC 5849 for OAuth 1.0 signatures, using standard cryptographic libraries and internal functions. No malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or external data leaks are present. Cryptographic routines are correctly implemented, with caching for RSA algorithms and proper key handling. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the code's purpose and security posture.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure implementation of OAuth 1.0 signature methods, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
