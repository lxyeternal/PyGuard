{
  "purpose": "This module provides functions to generate and verify OAuth 1.0 signatures using various methods such as HMAC-SHA1, HMAC-SHA256, RSA, and plaintext, in accordance with RFC 5849.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters such as 'request', 'client', 'body', 'headers', and 'uri'. It also reads credentials like secrets and RSA keys from client objects or function arguments.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include cryptographic functions (hmac.new, rsa.sign, rsa.verify) where untrusted or malicious data could influence signatures, and network-related operations if extended, but none are directly present. The code does not perform network communication or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., request parameters, headers, body, keys) flows into cryptographic functions (e.g., _sign_hmac, _sign_rsa). Signatures are generated based on signature base strings constructed from request data. The verification functions compare computed signatures with provided request signatures, ensuring integrity.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for OAuth signature creation and verification; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code paths are evident. Some deprecated functions emit warnings but do not introduce malicious behavior. The cache of RSA algorithms (_jwt_rsa) is a typical optimization. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The module strictly implements OAuth 1.0 signature algorithms, using standard cryptographic libraries (hashlib, hmac, jwt) for signing and verification. Functions handle data encoding, parameter normalization, and key preparation securely. There are no signs of malicious data handling, backdoors, or data leakage. The caching of RSA algorithms optimizes performance but does not pose security issues. Deprecated functions emit warnings but do not execute malicious behavior. The code adheres to RFC specifications and standard cryptographic practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-structured implementation of OAuth 1.0 signature mechanisms. There are no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or backdoors. It performs cryptographic signing and verification securely, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
