  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, focusing on the presence of issues, logical consistency, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes internal functions for OAuth 1.0 signature construction, with data sources correctly identified.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Cryptographic functions and data flow are standard; no external leaks or network activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors. Use of standard libraries and practices.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-founded; high confidence (0.95), malware (0), obfuscated (0).\n\n**Assessment:** The report's reasoning is sound. The security risk score (0.1) is reasonable given the cryptographic focus and internal use. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the module handles OAuth 1.0 signatures, with inputs from request data and credentials.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No network or external data leaks; cryptographic operations are standard.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. RSA algorithm cache is a typical optimization.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-reasoned; confidence at 0.95, malware (0).\n\n**Assessment:** No issues. The reasoning aligns with the code. The security risk score (0.1) is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the module's scope; inputs and outputs are standard.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks; cryptographic functions are standard.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. Warnings for deprecated functions are standard practice.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate; confidence at 0.95, malware (0).\n\n**Assessment:** No issues. The report's reasoning is consistent with the code. Security risk score (0.1) seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the module's internal cryptographic functions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No network activity or data exfiltration; cryptographic routines are standard.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. Warnings for deprecated functions are benign.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-supported; confidence at 0.9, malware (0).\n\n**Assessment:** No issues. The reasoning is sound, and the risk score is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the module's purpose; inputs are standard.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external leaks or malicious activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. Uses standard cryptographic libraries.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Very high confidence (1.0), malware (0).\n\n**Assessment:** No issues. The report's reasoning is solid, and the risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Confirmation:** The code matches the described functions; no issues are present.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All reports assign 0 malware and obfuscated scores, which is consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Risk Scores:** All are low (0.1 or 0.2), reflecting the internal cryptographic implementation with no evident vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear, well-structured, and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal, given the cryptographic operations are standard and internal.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent. No adjustments are necessary. The code appears secure, with no signs of malicious or obfuscated behavior.",
