  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for the oauthlib package, defining metadata, dependencies, and classifiers.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.rst file for long description; imports modules; static package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sources; no sinks for malicious data.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow; static configuration without external input.",
  "anomalies": "Comment 'Hack because logging + setuptools sucks' is unprofessional but not malicious; no obfuscation or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, straightforward setup.py script for packaging. It imports standard modules, reads a static README file, and calls setup() with package info. The only unusual element is an unprofessional comment, which does not impact security. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is present. All indicators point to benign, standard package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. The minor comment is unprofessional but not harmful. The assigned malware score of 0 and low security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
