  "purpose": "Implement signals based on blinker if available, otherwise fall back to a no-op implementation.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'Namespace' from 'blinker'; creation of '_signals' namespace; instantiation of 'scope_changed' signal.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external effects are present.",
  "flows": "Import attempt -> fallback class definitions if import fails -> creation of '_signals' namespace -> definition of 'scope_changed' signal.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; fallback classes '_FakeSignal' and 'Namespace' are benign and designed for safe fallback.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import 'Namespace' from 'blinker'. If unavailable, it defines dummy classes that mimic the interface but do nothing or raise errors. The 'scope_changed' signal is created within the namespace. The fallback 'send' method is a no-op lambda, and other methods either do nothing or raise errors. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code is a standard pattern for optional dependencies with safe fallbacks, and all signals and classes are benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for optional signaling support with no malicious activity or security risks. The fallback classes are safe, and the overall design is common and secure.",
