  "purpose": "Provide a signaling mechanism using the blinker library with a fallback to a noop implementation if blinker is not available.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'blinker.Namespace', conditional fallback classes for '_FakeSignal' and 'Namespace', creation of '_signals' Namespace instance, and the 'scope_changed' signal.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted data nor directly perform data leaks or malicious actions; it only defines classes and signals.",
  "flows": "Import of 'Namespace' from 'blinker' (source); fallback class definitions (source); creation of '_signals' namespace and 'scope_changed' signal (sink). No data flow from untrusted input to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a straightforward implementation of signal handling with conditional fallback. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import 'Namespace' from 'blinker' to enable signal support. If 'blinker' is missing, it defines fallback classes that mimic 'Namespace' and 'Signal' but with no real signaling capabilities. The fallback class '_FakeSignal' has methods that do nothing or raise errors when appropriate, avoiding malicious behavior. The code then creates a '_signals' namespace and a 'scope_changed' signal. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities. The design is a standard pattern to support optional dependencies with a safe fallback.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of a signal mechanism with fallback classes when 'blinker' is absent. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard, safe utility module.",
