  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a benign, standard pattern for optional dependency handling.\n- No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity are identified.\n- The fallback classes `_FakeSignal` and the dummy `Namespace` are designed to prevent errors when `blinker` isn't installed, not to perform any malicious actions.\n- The `send` method in `_FakeSignal` is a no-op lambda, which is safe.\n- The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain obfuscated code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code correctness:** The code correctly attempts to import `Namespace` from `blinker`. If unavailable, it defines dummy classes that mimic the interface, ensuring safe fallback.\n- **Malware presence:** No evidence of malware, malicious code, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None, as the code is primarily interface setup with safe fallbacks.\n- **Scores consistency:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n\n### Score Justification:\n- **Malware score (0.0):** Correct; no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score (0.0):** Correct; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score (~0.1):** Slightly above zero, reflecting minimal risk due to optional dependency handling, but overall very safe.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent.\n- No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, due to optional dependency fallback)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, safe implementation of optional signaling support with no security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.",
