  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The code is a standard optional dependency pattern with safe fallbacks.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None identified. The fallback class `_FakeSignal` is designed to safely disable signaling without malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0.0. These are reasonable given the benign nature.\n- **Justification for Scores:** No malicious behavior, just fallback logic.\n- **Overall:** The report's assessment aligns with the code's purpose.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. Similar to Report 1, it's a standard pattern.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None. The fallback classes are typical.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0.0. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity; safe fallback.\n- **Overall:** Correct assessment.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The code is straightforward.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None. The use of dummy classes is a common pattern.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0.0. Valid.\n- **Justification:** No malicious intent, just optional signaling support.\n- **Overall:** Consistent with the code.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. Again, a standard fallback pattern.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0.0.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior.\n- **Overall:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. Same pattern.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Risk = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0.\n- **Justification:** No risks identified.\n- **Overall:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code is a benign optional dependency pattern with safe fallbacks.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** None of the reports find obfuscation; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** The overall risk is minimal; the highest is 0.1, which is appropriate for a dependency that only provides optional signaling capabilities.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The code does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications.\n- The fallback classes are designed to prevent failures without executing malicious code.\n- The use of try-except import is standard practice for optional dependencies.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\nBased on the detailed review, I would assign the following scores:\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThese scores reflect the benign nature of the code, its purpose, and the absence of any suspicious or malicious activity.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a safe, standard implementation of optional signaling support with no security concerns.",
