  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code defines several custom exception classes for OAuth 1.0 error handling.\n- It uses functions like `add_params_to_uri` and `urlencode` from `oauthlib.common`.\n- The classes include attributes for error, description, URI, and methods to generate URL parameters or encoded strings.\n- No suspicious or malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are evident.\n- The request object is included in error messages, which could potentially leak sensitive info if the request contains such data, but this is context-dependent and not inherently malicious.\n- The reports consistently conclude that the code is standard, benign, and aligned with OAuth specifications.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and issues:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** The code is straightforward error class implementation. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  **No.** The code appears correct and follows standard patterns.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  - `malware`: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given no malicious activity.\n  - `securityRisk`: Slightly above 0 (0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal risk due to potential leakage if request info is sensitive, but overall very low.\n  - `obfuscated`: 0, consistent with no obfuscation.\n  - `confidence`: High (0.9–1.0), justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n- **Is the risk score justified?**  \n  For the highest risk scores (>0.5), no, because there's no malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The minimal risk relates to potential leakage via request info, but this is standard and not a security flaw.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- **Use of `request` in error messages:**  \n  Could leak sensitive info if `request` contains such data. However, this is a common pattern in error reporting, not necessarily malicious. It's a minor concern but not a security issue per se.\n\n- **Error URL generation:**  \n  The `in_uri()` method appends error info to URLs safely via `add_params_to_uri`. No evident vulnerabilities.\n\n- **External dependencies:**  \n  Reliance on `oauthlib.common` functions is standard; no issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — clear code.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 — minimal, related to potential info leakage if request data is sensitive, but this is standard in error reporting.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated:** **0**  \n- **Risk:** **0.1** — very low, considering potential info leakage if request contains sensitive data, but this is a typical aspect of error handling, not a flaw.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured implementation of OAuth 1 error classes. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The minor risk score reflects the potential for leaking request info via error messages, which is common in such implementations.\n\n**Final note:** No changes needed to the scores; they are consistent with the code and analysis.",
