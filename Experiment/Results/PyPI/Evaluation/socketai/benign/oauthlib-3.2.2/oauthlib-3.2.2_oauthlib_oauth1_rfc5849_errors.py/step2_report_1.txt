  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code defines custom exception classes for OAuth 1 error handling.\n- It uses functions like `add_params_to_uri` and `urlencode` to generate error URLs and parameters.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are evident.\n- The request object is included in error messages, which could potentially leak sensitive info if the request contains such data, but this is context-dependent and not inherently malicious.\n- The code appears straightforward, following standard patterns for error handling.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review per report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; defines OAuth 1 error classes.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correct; methods generate URLs and error messages.\n- **Anomalies:** None suspicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, standard implementation.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.1, Confidence=0.9 — seems reasonable.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's reasoning aligns with the code. The low risk and malware scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard error classes, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.1, Confidence=1.0 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** Minor concern about including `request` in error messages, which could leak sensitive info, but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious intent, just standard error handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.2, Confidence=0.9 — reasonable, considering the potential info leak concern.\n\n**Assessment:** The slightly higher risk score reflects awareness of the minor info leak concern, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard, safe error classes.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.1, Confidence=0.9 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.1, Confidence=0.9 — reasonable.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of scoring and recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** Slight variations, but generally low (0.1 or 0.2). Given the potential for request data leakage via error messages, a slightly higher score (0.2) is justified in report 3, which is already reflected.\n\n### Final personal estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 — minimal, mainly considering the request info in error messages.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and their scores are reasonable. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The only minor concern is the inclusion of request data in error messages, which is acknowledged but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code is a standard OAuth error handling implementation, safe and purpose-driven. The provided scores and reasoning are appropriate and consistent.",
