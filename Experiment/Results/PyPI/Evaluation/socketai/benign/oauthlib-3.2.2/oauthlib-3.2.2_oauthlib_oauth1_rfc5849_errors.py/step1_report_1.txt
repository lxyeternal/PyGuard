  "purpose": "Define custom OAuth 1.0 error classes for handling various error responses as per OAuth specifications.",
  "sources": "Input data includes description, URI, request objects, and internal error attributes used to generate error messages and URIs.",
  "sinks": "Methods like in_uri() and properties like urlencoded generate URLs or encoded strings, potentially exposing error details or URIs.",
  "flows": "Error attributes (error, description, uri) flow into URL parameters and error messages, potentially including sensitive info.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors; code is straightforward error class implementation. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of exception classes for OAuth 1.0 errors, with mechanisms to generate error URLs and encoded messages. No user input processing or insecure operations are present. The class structure appears standard, and there are no indications of malicious behavior or data leaks beyond standard error handling. Methods like in_uri() safely append error parameters to URIs, and no external network or data exfiltration is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical implementation of OAuth error classes for handling errors; it does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior. It primarily facilitates error reporting in OAuth workflows without exposing sensitive data or executing malicious actions.",
