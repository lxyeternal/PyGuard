  "purpose": "Define custom OAuth 1.0 error classes used for handling OAuth error responses in client and provider implementations.",
  "sources": "Error data such as error codes, descriptions, and URIs set within class attributes and constructor parameters.",
  "sinks": "Methods like in_uri and urlencoded that generate URIs and URL-encoded strings from error data.",
  "flows": "Error data (attributes) flow from class instantiation to methods that generate URIs and URL-encoded parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears to follow standard patterns for custom exception classes with structured error data.",
  "analysis": "The code defines error classes inheriting from Exception, with attributes for error details. The methods primarily generate URL parameters and URIs from stored data. No input is taken from untrusted sources; error information is set via class attributes and constructor arguments. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident, such as network activity, data leaks, or code injection. The use of add_params_to_uri and urlencode is standard for building URI parameters. Overall, the code is straightforward and adheres to common patterns for error handling in OAuth implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard error handling classes for OAuth 1.0, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain threats. It simply structures error data and provides utility methods for URL and URI generation.",
