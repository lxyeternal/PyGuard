  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code defines OAuth 1 error classes, with no suspicious or malicious constructs. It uses standard methods for URL parameter appending and error message formatting.\n- **Malware Score:** 0, aligns with no malicious behavior.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1, reasonable given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, confirms standard pattern, no malicious behavior. Error data flows into URL parameters and error messages.\n- **Malware Score:** 0, consistent.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1, appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct assessment.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Notes that the request object is included in error messages, which could leak sensitive info if the request contains such data. However, this is a contextual concern, not inherently malicious.\n- **Malware Score:** 0, no malicious code.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2, slightly higher due to potential info leakage, which is a minor security concern but not a critical vulnerability.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Reasonable. The inclusion of request info is a minor concern but not malicious.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Reiterates that the code is standard OAuth error handling, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1, appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, standard error classes, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, and the code shows no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports, consistent.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation, mostly around 0.1–0.2. Given the minor concern about including request info in error messages, a risk score of about 0.1–0.2 seems appropriate.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The code is a straightforward implementation of OAuth 1 error classes.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The only minor concern is the potential leakage of sensitive request data via error messages, which justifies a slightly elevated risk score but not more.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minor concern about error message content, but generally safe)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, benign implementation of OAuth 1 error handling classes, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The small risk score reflects the minor concern about potential information leakage through error messages containing request data.",
