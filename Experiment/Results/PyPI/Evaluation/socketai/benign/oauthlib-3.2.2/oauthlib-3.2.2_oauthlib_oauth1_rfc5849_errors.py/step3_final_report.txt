  "purpose": "Defines OAuth 1 error classes for error responses, URL parameter handling, and message formatting.",
  "sources": "Error message construction, URL parameter appending via add_params_to_uri, and error attribute access.",
  "sinks": "Generated URLs with error parameters, error message strings including request object.",
  "flows": "Error class attributes and methods generate URL parameters and messages from error data and request object.",
  "anomalies": "Inclusion of request object in error messages could leak sensitive info; no malicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard OAuth 1 error classes with functions to generate error URLs and messages. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The use of request in error messages poses a minor potential for info leakage but is common in error handling. External functions are standard, and the code structure is straightforward. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and risk score is low (~0.1-0.2) due to potential info leakage, which is a minor concern but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of OAuth 1 error handling classes with no malicious intent. The minor risk relates to potential leakage of request data in error messages, which is typical in error reporting but should be used cautiously. Overall, the code is safe and well-structured.",
