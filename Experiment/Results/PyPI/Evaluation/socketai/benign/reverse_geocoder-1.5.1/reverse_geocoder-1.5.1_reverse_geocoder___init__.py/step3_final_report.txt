{
  "purpose": "The code implements an offline reverse geocoder using publicly available datasets, processing them into spatial indices for fast lookup.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from URLs (geonames.org), local files (cities1000.zip, admin1CodesASCII.txt, admin2Codes.txt), and CSV/ZIP archives.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write untrusted data or send data over the network after initial download; it only reads and processes data locally.",
  "flows": "Data is downloaded from trusted sources, extracted, processed into CSV, then loaded into memory and spatial indices for querying.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The only external activity is data download without signature verification.",
  "analysis": "The code downloads datasets from public URLs, extracts and processes them into CSV files, and builds spatial indices for reverse geocoding. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The data download step could be a vector for tampering if sources are compromised, but this is a common pattern in open-source geocoding tools. The code's logic is straightforward, and no suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate open-source reverse geocoder relying on publicly available data. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected. The main security concern is the lack of data signature verification, but this does not constitute malware. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score should be set around 0.1 to 0.2 to reflect the data download without validation.",
