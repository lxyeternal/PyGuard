{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the 'reverse_geocoder' Python package, including dependencies and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.txt' for long_description, importing os, distutils, and setuptools modules, reading numpy's include directory during build.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code does not write or send untrusted data or perform any network operations.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted inputs; mainly static configuration and file reading.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __builtins__.__NUMPY_SETUP__ is a deprecated workaround to prevent numpy from thinking it is in setup; this is a common pattern in build scripts, not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles package setup, including dependencies and package data. It reads a README file for description, manages numpy include directories, and sets package metadata. The workaround for numpy's setup state is a standard practice. No network connections, data leaks, or malicious code are present. All operations are typical for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is used solely for package configuration and dependency management.",
