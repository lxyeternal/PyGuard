{
  "purpose": "This setup script is used for packaging and installing the 'reverse_geocoder' Python project, managing dependencies, and configuring build options.",
  "sources": "Reads README.txt for long description; reads CSV file 'rg_cities1000.csv' as package data; imports from standard libraries and third-party packages (numpy, scipy).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no untrusted data output or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Reads external files (README.txt, CSV data) for setup; imports dependencies without executing untrusted code; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of deprecated distutils.core.setup alongside setuptools; no suspicious or unusual code constructs; no hardcoded secrets or backdoors present; no obfuscated code or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It reads static files for descriptions and package data, manages dependencies such as numpy and scipy, and defines a custom build extension for handling numpy's build process. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration. The script does not process untrusted input or execute any code that could be harmful. Its structure and content are typical for a Python package setup, with no anomalies indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup script for packaging a Python project with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It handles dependencies and package data safely and predictably.",
