{
  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for the reverse_geocoder Python package, including dependencies and package data.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'README.txt' file to generate long_description; also loads numpy to obtain include directories during build.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly indicate data sinks or untrusted data flows; no output or external communication is performed.",
  "flows": "The setup process reads local files for metadata and configuration; no untrusted data flow is apparent.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses the deprecated 'distutils.core' for setup and overrides build_ext to handle numpy dependencies; no malicious or suspicious code patterns are present. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py for a Python package, managing dependencies, package data, and build customization for numpy. It does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications. The code is straightforward and adheres to common packaging practices without obfuscation or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily manages package metadata, dependencies, and build configurations.",
