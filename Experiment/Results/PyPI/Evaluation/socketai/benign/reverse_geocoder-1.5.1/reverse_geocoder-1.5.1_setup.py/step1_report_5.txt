{
  "purpose": "To set up the 'reverse_geocoder' Python package with its dependencies and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.txt' file for long description; importing modules; reading package data files.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data, code injection, or malicious operations; setup process mainly handles package configuration.",
  "flows": "Reading files (README.txt) -> setup configuration; importing numpy/scipy -> setting include directories for build process.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; the code handles dependencies and package data normally.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py configuration for a Python package. It reads a README file, configures dependencies (numpy, scipy), and sets up package data. The custom build_ext class manages numpy include paths. There are no signs of malicious code such as network communication, data exfiltration, or hidden behavior. All operations are standard for package setup. The use of __builtins__.__NUMPY_SETUP__ is a common workaround to prevent numpy's setup issues, not malicious. No obfuscation or suspicious dynamic code execution is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package without any malicious behavior or security risks. It solely manages package setup and dependencies with no suspicious elements.",
