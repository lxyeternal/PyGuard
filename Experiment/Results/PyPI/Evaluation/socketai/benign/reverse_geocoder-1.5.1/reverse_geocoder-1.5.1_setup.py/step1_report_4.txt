{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the 'reverse_geocoder' Python package including dependencies and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.txt' file, importing modules, defining the 'build_ext' class, and setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data affects system security or leaks occur.",
  "flows": "Reading the file content -> Importing modules -> Custom build extension -> Package installation process.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated 'distutils.core' alongside 'setuptools', which might be unconventional but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code. No network activity or data exfiltration present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily configures package setup parameters, manages dependencies, and includes a custom build class for handling numpy during setup. It reads a README file, manages package data, and specifies dependencies. No input validation, network operations, or executable code that could be malicious. Use of 'distutils.core' is outdated but not malicious. The code appears standard for a Python package setup script, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious intent or security threats detected. It does not contain malicious behaviors or sabotage elements.",
