{
  "purpose": "This setup.py script configures the packaging of a Python project named 'reverse_geocoder', managing dependencies, package data, and build customization.",
  "sources": "Reads local files ('README.txt', CSV data), manages dependencies ('numpy', 'scipy'), and handles build extension for numpy include directories.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no network activity, data leaks, or external data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "Reads local files for description and package data; dependencies are specified but not dynamically fetched or executed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated 'distutils.core' alongside 'setuptools' and a workaround involving '__builtins__.__NUMPY_SETUP__' are noted but are common practices, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging. It reads local files, manages dependencies, and customizes build steps for numpy. No suspicious or malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The deprecated practices are acknowledged but do not indicate malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are consistent with the code's behavior, reflecting minimal security concern primarily due to outdated practices, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py is benign, with no signs of malware or malicious behavior. The minor security risk is due to deprecated practices, which do not pose security threats. The code is typical for Python packaging and does not warrant concern.",
