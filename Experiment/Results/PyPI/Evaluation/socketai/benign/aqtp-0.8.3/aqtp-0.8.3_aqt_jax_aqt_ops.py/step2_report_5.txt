  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the original code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior:**\n   - The original code solely performs import statements and assigns imported functions to new variables.\n   - No data processing, network activity, dynamic code execution, or untrusted input handling is present.\n   - The code contains licensing and documentation comments, typical for open-source ML libraries.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are evident.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that the code is straightforward, benign, and related to ML operations.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are apparent in the reports.\n   - The reasoning aligns with the code's simplicity and purpose.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - Confidence levels are high (mostly 1 or 0.9), which is reasonable.\n   - The purpose of the code is to set up aliases for functions used elsewhere; it does not execute or process untrusted data.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Their Justification:**\n   - Since the code only imports and aliases functions, the risk of malicious activity is negligible.\n   - The malware score should remain at 0.\n   - The obfuscated score should be 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - The security risk score should be 0, given no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - If the imported modules or functions were malicious or compromised, that would be a concern. However, based solely on this code snippet, there's no evidence of that.\n   - The reports do not mention any suspicious external dependencies or signs of obfuscation, which is consistent with the code.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall,** the code is a benign setup module for ML quantization functions with no security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Score | Justification                                                                 |\n|------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0            | No malicious behavior or code execution present.                            |\n| Obfuscated       | 0            | Code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.                              |\n| Risk             | 0            | No vulnerabilities or security risks identified.                            |\n\nPlease let me know if further analysis is needed!",
