  "purpose": "This code snippet contains only licensing comments, version information, and a module docstring; it serves as metadata or header information for the software.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data sources; only static comments and strings.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows; no execution or data processing occurs in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, data handling, or suspicious patterns; only license and version info.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely metadata with licensing comments, a version string, and a descriptive docstring. There are no functions, classes, data inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is standard boilerplate for open-source projects, serving as documentation and licensing information. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, and the assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, containing only license and metadata information. There is no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risk. The current assessment and scores are accurate and should remain unchanged.",
