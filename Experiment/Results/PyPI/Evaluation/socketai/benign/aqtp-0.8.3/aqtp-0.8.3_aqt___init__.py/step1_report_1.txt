  "purpose": "Provide an accurate quantized training library, as indicated by the comment and license information.",
  "sources": "No data input sources are present in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow pathways are identifiable from the given code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only licensing comments, version declaration, and a docstring; no executable code, data handling, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet consists solely of license comments, a version string, and a docstring describing the purpose of the library. There are no imports, functions, classes, data inputs, outputs, or execution logic present. No anomalous or malicious behaviors can be inferred from this minimal fragment. The code appears to be boilerplate or header comments typical of a Python package, with no evidence of security risks, malicious code, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a non-executable header containing licensing and version information for a library. It poses no security threat or malicious intent, and there is no suspicious behavior or obfuscation detected.",
