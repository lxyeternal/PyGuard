  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their claims with the provided code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes the utility functions for quantization, matching the code.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly notes no external data sinks or malicious external communication.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious intent detected.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately concludes the code is legitimate with high confidence.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Obfuscated: 0.0 — correct  \n- Malware: 0.0 — no malicious behavior detected  \n- Security Risk: 0.0 — no evident security issues\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment, no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, with consistent reasoning.  \n- Slightly lower confidence (0.95), which is acceptable given the nature of the code.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — correct  \n- Malware: 0 — no malicious behavior  \n- Security Risk: 0 — no security issues\n\n**Verdict:** Well justified, no concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Same as above, consistent analysis, noting standard utility functions, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Slightly more cautious, notes \"securityRisk\": 0.1, but emphasizes no malicious code.\n\n- The only potential concern is the \"securityRisk\" being 0.1, which is low and could be due to the general nature of configuration checks, not actual malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0.1 — acceptable given the cautious note, but still very low.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning is sound; the low security risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Similar to others, with no suspicious elements detected.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code confirmation:** The code is a standard utility module for quantization in ML workflows, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- **Malware risk:** Zero across all reports, consistent with the code.\n- **Obfuscation:** Not present.\n- **Security risk:** Near zero, with a very conservative note in report 4.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The **malware score** should remain at **0.0** — no malicious activity.\n- The **obfuscated score** should be **0.0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- The **risk score** should be **very low (around 0.0 to 0.1)**, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — code is clear, standard utility functions.\n- **Risk:** 0.05 — negligible security risk, mainly due to configuration checks, not malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility module for quantization with no security concerns.",
