  "purpose": "Utility functions for quantization decisions in ML workflows, handling quantized variables and determining whether to apply int8 quantization based on configuration.",
  "sources": "Configuration attributes within aqt_tensor.TensorQuantizer objects, specifically config and last_update, and the quantized_variable.value.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or network communication; data flows internally within trusted objects and functions.",
  "flows": "Input tensors x are processed based on quantizer configurations; decision functions evaluate configuration states to determine quantization applicability.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward configuration checks and data casting without obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard utility functions for ML quantization, performing configuration-based checks and data casting. It does not handle untrusted input, perform network operations, or include obfuscated code. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The functions rely on trusted configuration objects and perform logical operations consistent with ML quantization workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign utility module for quantization in ML workflows. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores should reflect zero malware and obfuscation, with a very low security risk score justified by the benign nature of the code.",
