  "purpose": "Setup script for the AQT package, configuring package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file for long description, importing setup tools, and defining dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no untrusted data handling, network activity, or sensitive data processing.",
  "flows": "Reading the README file, passing dependency lists to setup functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior. The code appears standard for a Python setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setup procedures from setuptools, reads a README file, defines dependencies, and specifies package metadata. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity is present. The dependencies listed are common scientific and ML libraries, and there are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The overall structure and content are typical for open-source package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign setup.py script for package configuration, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
