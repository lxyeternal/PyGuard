{
  "purpose": "The setup.py script configures the package distribution for the 'aqtp' Python project, including metadata, dependencies, and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md file for long description, imports standard libraries and setuptools modules, and specifies dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no external data or inputs are processed or sent.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md content as input to long_description; dependencies and metadata are static and hardcoded; no data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code detected. The script performs standard setup routines.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python setup script. It reads a README file with proper encoding, handles potential IO errors gracefully, and specifies package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. There are no indications of malicious behavior, external data transmission, or obfuscated code. The dependencies are standard for scientific Python packages and do not pose security concerns within this context.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py script is a standard, benign package configuration file with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
