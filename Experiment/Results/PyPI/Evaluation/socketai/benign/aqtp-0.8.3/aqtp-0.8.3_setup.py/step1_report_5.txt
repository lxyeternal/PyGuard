  "purpose": "The setup.py script for configuring and installing the AQT package, including dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file from disk",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or user input; no code execution or data leaks observed",
  "flows": "Reading README.md and passing static package metadata to setuptools functions",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles package metadata, dependencies, and setup configuration. It reads a README file for long description, which is a standard practice, with exception handling for file absence. Dependencies are declared explicitly, and the setup configuration follows typical patterns for Python packages. No suspicious or malicious code, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
