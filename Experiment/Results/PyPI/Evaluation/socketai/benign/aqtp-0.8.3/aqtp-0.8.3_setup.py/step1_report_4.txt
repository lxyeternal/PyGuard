  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for packaging a Python project named 'aqtp'.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description, and static package dependencies for installation requirements.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes or executes untrusted data; no network or file system sinks that could be exploited for malicious actions.",
  "flows": "N/A - the script primarily reads static data and sets up package metadata; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or behavior; the code is standard for Python package setup. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical setup operations: reading a README file, defining dependencies, and configuring package metadata. It uses safe methods for file reading and package configuration. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or data leaks are present. The code adheres to standard practices for Python package setup files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It merely configures package installation parameters. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
