  "purpose": "Standard setup.py script for packaging the Python project 'AQT', configuring metadata, dependencies, and reading the README file.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file; no untrusted input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; no network, file, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Reads static README content; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, well-structured setup script for a Python package. It reads a README file with exception handling, defines dependencies, and sets package metadata. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or suspicious behaviors. The dependencies are standard scientific libraries, and the code adheres to common practices. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are accurate and justified based on the code content.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package setup file with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No further action or modifications are necessary.",
