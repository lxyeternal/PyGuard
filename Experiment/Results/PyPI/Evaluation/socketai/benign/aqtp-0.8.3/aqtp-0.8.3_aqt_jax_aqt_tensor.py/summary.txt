  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of quantization and calibration routines for neural network training. There are no signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1) reflecting the inherent sensitivity of training routines but not malicious intent."
