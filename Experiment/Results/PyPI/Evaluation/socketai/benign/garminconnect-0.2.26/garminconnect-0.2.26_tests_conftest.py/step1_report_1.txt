  "purpose": "This code provides functions to sanitize sensitive information such as cookies, tokens, and credentials in HTTP requests and responses for testing purposes using VCR.py fixtures.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (os.environ), request body (request.body), request headers (request.headers), response headers (response['headers']), response body (response['body']['string'])",
  "sinks": "Modifying request and response bodies and headers to sanitize sensitive data, including cookies and tokens",
  "flows": "Input data (cookies, request bodies, headers) is sanitized before being recorded by VCR to prevent sensitive data from being stored; sanitized data is then used in tests",
  "anomalies": "No malicious or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code only performs data sanitization; no data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity is present",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for sanitizing cookies, request bodies, and response bodies, replacing sensitive tokens and credentials with placeholders. It uses regex for pattern matching and JSON parsing for structured data. The fixtures integrate these functions into VCR.py recording hooks, which is standard practice for sanitizing test recordings. There are no signs of malicious code, such as data theft, secret exfiltration, or malicious network connections. The code appears solely focused on data sanitization for testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard sanitization utility for VCR.py test recordings, with no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. It only manipulates data to protect sensitive information during testing.",
