{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to sanitize sensitive data such as cookies, tokens, and credentials in HTTP request and response objects during testing, preventing leakage of sensitive information in test recordings.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from request.body (decoding UTF-8), request.headers['Cookie'], response['headers'], and response['body']['string'] (decoding UTF-8).",
  "sinks": "Modifies request.body, request.headers['Cookie'], response['headers'][...] (cookies), and response['body']['string'] (JSON fields and raw body).",
  "flows": "Source data (request body, headers, response body) is processed through regex substitutions and JSON parsing, then written back to the same fields, sanitizing sensitive fields like tokens and cookies.",
  "anomalies": "Use of '...' in exception handling for UnicodeDecodeError; no malicious or obfuscated code detected; standard sanitization logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs regex-based masking of sensitive tokens and cookies in HTTP request/response data, including JSON fields. It uses straightforward methods without obfuscation or malicious behavior. No network activity or backdoors are present. The exception handling with '...' is a minimal stylistic concern but does not introduce security issues. The overall logic is clear, standard, and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard sanitization utility used in testing environments to prevent sensitive data leakage. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are appropriate, though a risk score of 0 could also be justified given the benign nature.",
