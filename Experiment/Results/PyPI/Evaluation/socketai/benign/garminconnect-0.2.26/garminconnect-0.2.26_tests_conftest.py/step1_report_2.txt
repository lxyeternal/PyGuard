{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to sanitize sensitive information such as cookies, tokens, and headers from HTTP requests and responses during testing or recording, preventing leakage of secrets or credentials.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'GARMINTOKENS', request body, request headers ('Cookie'), response headers ('set-cookie', 'Set-Cookie'), and response body.",
  "sinks": "Modifies request and response data in-place, including request body, headers, and response body JSON content, replacing sensitive fields with 'SANITIZED'.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (environment variable, request headers/body, response headers/body) through regex and JSON parsing, then is sanitized and re-assigned back to request/response objects.",
  "anomalies": "Uses ellipsis '...' in exception handling for UnicodeDecodeError without handling; the code structure is straightforward, with no evident malicious code or obfuscation. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily functions as a sanitization filter for HTTP traffic during testing, replacing sensitive tokens and cookies with sanitized placeholders. It reads environment variables and request/response data, then processes and overwrites the sensitive parts accordingly. No dynamic code execution, network communication, or suspicious behavior detected. The exception handling is minimal but does not introduce malicious behavior. Overall, the code is standard for test data sanitization, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign sanitization utility used in testing environments to prevent exposure of sensitive data. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this code snippet.",
