  "conclusion": "This code is a standard sanitization utility used in testing environments to prevent sensitive data leakage. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are appropriate, though a risk score of 0 could also be justified given the benign nature."
