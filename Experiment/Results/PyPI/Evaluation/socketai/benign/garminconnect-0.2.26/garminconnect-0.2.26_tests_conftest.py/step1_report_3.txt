{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to sanitize sensitive information such as cookies, tokens, and authorization headers in HTTP requests and responses for testing purposes, particularly when recording HTTP interactions with VCR.py.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'GARMINTOKENS', request body, request headers ('Cookie'), response headers ('set-cookie', 'Set-Cookie'), response body, and specific fields within JSON response bodies.",
  "sinks": "Modifies request bodies, request headers, response headers, and response bodies to sanitize sensitive data; potential to alter data during testing but not maliciously.",
  "flows": "Sensitive data is read from environment variables, request/response headers, and bodies; then replaced with sanitized placeholders in the sanitize functions; no data leakage or malicious data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "The code primarily performs data sanitization for testing; no suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or hardcoded credentials present. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses regex substitutions to mask sensitive tokens and cookies in HTTP requests and responses, including JSON parsing and encoding. It relies on standard libraries and established testing frameworks (pytest). There are no indications of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system sabotage. The code functions as a sanitization layer for testing data, which is a common security practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a sanitization utility intended for secure testing environments. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks beyond standard data masking. It is aligned with good practices for handling sensitive information during testing.",
