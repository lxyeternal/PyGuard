  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign Garmin Connect API wrapper with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or sabotage. The minimal security concerns relate to external validation of uploaded files and token management, which are standard considerations but do not indicate malicious intent. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior and structure."
