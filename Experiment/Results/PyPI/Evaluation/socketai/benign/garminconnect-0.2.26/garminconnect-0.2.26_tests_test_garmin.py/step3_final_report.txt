  "purpose": "A set of pytest unit tests for the garminconnect Python library, verifying various data retrieval and upload functions.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded email/password, fixed date, test file paths, and static inputs used in API calls.",
  "sinks": "API responses and file uploads; no external data leaks or suspicious network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from static inputs (credentials, dates, files) into API methods; outputs are validated via assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation or malicious code detected; credentials are hardcoded, which is typical in test environments.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward test code interacting with Garmin API endpoints. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious network behavior. The main security concern is the use of hardcoded credentials, which is common in testing but should be managed securely outside production. The code structure and logic are standard, with no obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a test suite for Garmin API interactions. No malicious behavior or malware detected. The security risk is very low, primarily due to credential exposure in test code, which is a known practice but not malicious. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting the credential handling concern.",
