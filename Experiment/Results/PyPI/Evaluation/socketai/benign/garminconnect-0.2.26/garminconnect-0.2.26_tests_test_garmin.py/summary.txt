  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a test suite for Garmin API interactions. No malicious behavior or malware detected. The security risk is very low, primarily due to credential exposure in test code, which is a known practice but not malicious. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting the credential handling concern."
