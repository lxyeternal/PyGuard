      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign Garmin Connect API wrapper with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or sabotage. The minimal security concerns relate to external validation of uploaded files and token management, which are standard considerations but do not indicate malicious intent. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior and structure."

      "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate, standard implementation of a FIT protocol encoder for health and fitness data. It performs data packing, checksum validation, and file structuring without any malicious or suspicious features. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1), justified by the routine data handling and checksum routines. No modifications are necessary."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a test suite for Garmin API interactions. No malicious behavior or malware detected. The security risk is very low, primarily due to credential exposure in test code, which is a known practice but not malicious. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting the credential handling concern."

      "conclusion": "This code is a standard sanitization utility used in testing environments to prevent sensitive data leakage. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are appropriate, though a risk score of 0 could also be justified given the benign nature."
