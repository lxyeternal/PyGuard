  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** Correctly identifies that the script is a standard setup script with no malicious activity.\n- **Code presence:** No suspicious code, external commands, or network activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, no issues.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Notes that replacing '==' with '>=' in requirements is unusual but benign.\n- **Code presence:** The `load_reqs` function does exactly that; no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — slightly elevated risk score due to modification of dependencies, but this is not inherently malicious.\n- **Justification:** The report reasonably states that the change is benign. The small risk score (0.1) seems appropriate given the unusual dependency modification but not malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable. No need to increase malware or obfuscated scores. The risk score is acceptable at 0.1.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 2, finds no malicious activity, just dependency processing.\n- **Code presence:** Same as above, no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No changes necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard setup script with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Code presence:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as previous, standard setup code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard setup script with no malicious activity.\n- The only minor point is the modification of dependency version specifiers from '==' to '>=', which is unusual but not malicious.\n- The risk scores assigned are low and justified, given the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected in any report.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n\n**Risk Score:** 0.1 — the only minor concern is the dependency version modification, which is benign but slightly unconventional.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThe current scores in the reports are consistent with this assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code is a typical, benign setup script.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The small risk score reflects the unusual dependency version modification, which is benign.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The current reports and scores are appropriate and accurate.",
