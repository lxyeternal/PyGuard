  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for package configuration and dependency management.",
  "sources": "Reads README.rst, HISTORY.rst, and requirements files; processes dependencies; invokes setuptools.setup().",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data outputs, network activity, or external command executions.",
  "flows": "Reads static files -> processes dependency strings -> passes data to setup()",
  "anomalies": "Replaces '==' with '>=' in requirements, which is unusual but benign; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script performing static file reads and dependency processing. The regex substitution in load_reqs() modifies dependency specifications but does not introduce malicious behavior. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or handling of untrusted input beyond static files. The dependency change could potentially cause dependency conflicts but is not security-related. The code structure is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malware. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are justified and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The minor dependency specification change does not constitute a security threat but warrants a very low risk score. Overall, the supply chain integrity appears intact, and the code poses no significant security concern.",
