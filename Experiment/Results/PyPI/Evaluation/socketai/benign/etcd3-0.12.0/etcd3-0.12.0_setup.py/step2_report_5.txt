  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard setup script, reads documentation and requirements files.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or network operations.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code; regex in requirements parsing is straightforward.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a typical setup script with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — **appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar setup script, with emphasis on reading and processing requirements.\n- **Anomalies:** The replacement of '==' with '>=' in requirements is unusual but benign.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity; minor modification to dependencies, but not harmful.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — perhaps slightly high, but considering the change to requirements, a small security risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, standard package setup.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code; only requirement string modification.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard setup script.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious code detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate setup script.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity. The code is static, reads files, and calls setup() without executing untrusted code or network operations. **Malware score should remain at 0.**\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected in any report. The code is straightforward and standard. **Obfuscated score should be 0.**\n\n- **Risk Score:** The only minor concern is the replacement of '==' with '>=' in requirements files, which could alter dependency versions. This is not malicious but could cause dependency issues or supply chain risks if dependencies are not properly managed. Given that, a **risk score of around 0.1 to 0.2** seems reasonable, but not higher.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendation:**\n\n| Metric             | Suggested Score |\n|--------------------|-----------------|\n| Malware            | **0**           |\n| Obfuscated         | **0**           |\n| Security Risk      | **0.1 - 0.2**   |\n\nThe current scores in the reports are consistent with the analysis, especially given the absence of malicious or obfuscated code. The only minor point is the dependency modification, which could be flagged as a small security consideration but not a significant risk.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe setup scripts are standard, benign, and contain no malicious or obfuscated code. The slight modification to dependency requirements warrants a minimal security risk score, but overall, the supply chain integrity appears intact.",
