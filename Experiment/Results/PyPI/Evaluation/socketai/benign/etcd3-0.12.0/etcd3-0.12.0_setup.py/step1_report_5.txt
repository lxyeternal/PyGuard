  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'etcd3' Python client, including reading requirements and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads README.rst, HISTORY.rst, and requirement files; no untrusted input sources present.",
  "sinks": "Uses setup() to define package metadata; no sinks that handle untrusted data or perform dangerous operations.",
  "flows": "Loads requirement files and package metadata, then passes to setup(), with no flow leading to untrusted data execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script reads static files for documentation and requirements, then configures package setup parameters. It performs standard package setup procedures without executing untrusted code or performing malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be legitimate packaging code.",
