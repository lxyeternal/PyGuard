  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and the findings.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is a typical Python `setup.py` script, performing standard package configuration.\n- The only notable operation is the `load_reqs()` function, which reads requirements files and replaces `'=='` with `'>='``. This is an unusual modification but not inherently malicious.\n- There are no external commands, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are present.\n- The code does not process untrusted input beyond reading static files.\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the script is benign, with no malicious activity or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code matches the description and the analysis. No discrepancies or malicious code detected.\n- The requirement modification (replacing `'=='` with `'>='`) is benign but unusual; it could potentially cause dependency conflicts, but not security issues.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- The main \"flaw\" is the modification of dependency specifications, which could lead to incompatible dependencies but is not a security flaw.\n- No other flaws are evident.\n\n### Scores assessment:\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 or very low, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- The confidence scores are high (1 or 0.9), consistent with the thorough analysis.\n\n### Risk justification:\n- Since no malicious code, network activity, or untrusted data handling exists, the risk score should remain at **0**.\n- The only potential concern is dependency specification changes, but these are not security issues.\n\n### Malware score:\n- No malware activity is detected; score should be **0**.\n\n### Obfuscated:\n- The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation; score should be **0**.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Reasoning:**  \n- No malicious behavior, code obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.  \n- The code is a standard setup script with a minor, benign modification to dependency specifications.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate; the code is benign, and the scores are appropriate. The only minor note is the dependency requirement modification, which could impact dependency resolution but is not malicious.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nNo changes needed; the code is safe, and the scores reflect that.",
