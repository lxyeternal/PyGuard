  "purpose": "Configuration script for Sphinx documentation setup, including path adjustments, extensions, and version info.",
  "sources": "Imports 'etcd3' for version info; modifies sys.path; redefines functools.wraps with no_op_wraps.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external communication; no malicious sinks present.",
  "flows": "Import of 'etcd3' and path modifications; override of functools.wraps affects function metadata but not data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Redefinition of functools.wraps to a no-op function, which disables decorator metadata preservation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration with an unusual override of functools.wraps, likely for documentation or debugging purposes. No data leaks, network activity, or malicious code are present. The override could hinder debugging or documentation clarity but does not introduce security vulnerabilities. The import of 'etcd3' is benign. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are appropriate given the context.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign configuration file with an unusual but harmless override of a standard library function. No malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain sabotage are evident. The low security risk score is justified, and the malware score correctly remains zero.",
