      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The minor dependency specification change does not constitute a security threat but warrants a very low risk score. Overall, the supply chain integrity appears intact, and the code poses no significant security concern."

      "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate, standard implementation of a distributed lock using etcd3. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscation is detected. The low security risk score (0.2) reflects operational concerns rather than malicious threats. The malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0. The code is safe for use in production environments, with minor improvements possible for robustness."
