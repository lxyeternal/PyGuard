{
  "purpose": "Defines a Member class for managing etcd cluster members, including removing and updating members and retrieving alarms.",
  "sources": "Inputs are constructor parameters (id, name, peer_urls, client_urls), and method calls on self._etcd_client.",
  "sinks": "Calls to self._etcd_client methods: remove_member, update_member, list_alarms.",
  "flows": "Constructor assigns parameters to instance variables; methods invoke corresponding methods on _etcd_client with member id and other parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of external client methods appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The class provides an interface to manage etcd cluster members via an injected client object. The code is straightforward, with no suspicious logic or obfuscated code. The _etcd_client object is used to perform cluster operations, which is typical for such management classes. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication outside expected methods, or backdoors. The code does not perform any input validation or sanitization, but this is not inherently malicious—just a potential security consideration for the client methods themselves.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and typical for a cluster management interface. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident within this snippet.",
