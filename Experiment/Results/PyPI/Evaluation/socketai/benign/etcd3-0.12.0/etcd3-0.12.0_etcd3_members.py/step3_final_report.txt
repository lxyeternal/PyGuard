{
  "purpose": "Defines a Member class for managing etcd cluster members via delegated external client calls, providing removal, update, and alarm retrieval functionalities.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from constructor parameters (id, name, peer_urls, client_urls) and external _etcd_client method calls (remove_member, update_member, list_alarms).",
  "sinks": "Delegates to _etcd_client methods; potential data leaks or malicious actions depend on external client behavior, not within this code.",
  "flows": "Constructor initializes attributes; methods pass member id and URLs to external client; active_alarms property calls list_alarms with member id.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; reliance on external client is standard but a trust point.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward wrapper for etcd member management, delegating actions to an external client. It contains no malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The reliance on _etcd_client is typical but assumes trustworthiness. No input validation issues are evident, and the logic is clear and correct.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score reflects reliance on external client trust, but within this snippet, the code itself is safe. Scores are consistent and justified.",
