  "purpose": "Utility functions for byte manipulation, encoding, lease ID extraction, and response event iteration.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions: byte_string, maybe_bytestring, lease, response_iterator.",
  "sinks": "The functions do not appear to write data to external systems, network, or storage.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from function parameters through transformations; no external or untrusted data sinks identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated patterns. The functions perform simple, safe operations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward utility functions. 'increment_last_byte' increments the last byte of a byte sequence without validation (but this is safe for typical use). 'to_bytes' encodes strings to bytes or returns bytes directly, which is standard. 'lease_to_id' retrieves an ID from an object or converts input to int, with minimal error handling. 'response_to_event_iterator' yields events from a response iterator, with no external side effects. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, designed for utility purposes within a larger application. No malicious or suspicious activity detected.",
