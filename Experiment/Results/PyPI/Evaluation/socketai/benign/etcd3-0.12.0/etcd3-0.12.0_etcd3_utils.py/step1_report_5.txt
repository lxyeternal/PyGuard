  "purpose": "Utility functions for byte manipulation, encoding, lease ID extraction, and response iteration in a broader system.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as byte_string, maybe_bytestring, lease, and response_iterator",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is written to external systems or used insecurely",
  "flows": "Input data (byte_string, maybe_bytestring, lease, response_iterator) flows through simple processing functions with no external side-effects or data leaks",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated segments; functions are straightforward. No malicious backdoors or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions: increment_last_byte modifies a byte sequence; to_bytes encodes strings to bytes; lease_to_id extracts an ID from an object or string; response_to_event_iterator processes response objects into events. All functions perform safe, common operations without external side-effects. No signs of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. No sensitive data handling or security risks detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions without malicious behavior. No security risks or malware signals identified. The code is standard and safe for inclusion in larger projects.",
