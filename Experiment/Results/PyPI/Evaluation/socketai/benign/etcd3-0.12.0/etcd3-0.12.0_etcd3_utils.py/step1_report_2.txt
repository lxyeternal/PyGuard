  "purpose": "Utility functions for byte manipulation, type conversion, lease identification, and response iteration",
  "sources": "Input data from response_iterator, lease objects or strings, and byte_string inputs",
  "sinks": "Data conversion functions and iteration over response data, no evident sink points for untrusted data leading to vulnerabilities",
  "flows": "Input data from response_iterator flows through nested loops; lease parameter flow depends on its type; byte_string manipulations occur in increment_last_byte",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. Functions are straightforward and serve typical utility purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions: increment_last_byte modifies the last byte of a byte string; to_bytes encodes strings to bytes; lease_to_id extracts an ID from a lease object or string; response_to_event_iterator converts response iterators to event iterators. All functions perform standard data processing without external calls, network activity, or sensitive data handling. No suspicious or malicious behavior observed. No anomalies like obfuscated code, backdoors, or secret exfiltration points.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It performs basic data manipulations and iteration without any suspicious behavior.",
