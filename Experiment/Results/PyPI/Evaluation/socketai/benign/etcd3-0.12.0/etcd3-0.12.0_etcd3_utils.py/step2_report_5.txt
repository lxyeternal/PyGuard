  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple utility functions performing straightforward operations.\n- No suspicious external connections, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code are identified.\n- The functions do not perform network activity, data exfiltration, or write to external systems.\n- The malware scores are all zero, consistent with the benign descriptions.\n- The security risk scores are low, reflecting minimal concern.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations of code correctness and issues:\n- The code snippets are correct and do not contain errors or flaws.\n- No evidence of code that could be exploited or misused in a security context.\n- The functions are standard and safe.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in reasoning:\n- The reports correctly identify the functions as benign utility functions.\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n### Scores assessment:\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, which is reasonable given the code clarity.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), which is acceptable given the functions' benign nature.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- No higher scores are justified since there's no evidence of malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation.\n\n### Consistency check:\n- The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or 1), reflecting strong agreement on benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 (keeping the lowest possible to acknowledge minimal inherent risk, but it's essentially negligible)\n\n**Note:** Given the nature of these utility functions, the risk is minimal, and no changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is benign utility functions.\n- No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.\n- Scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n- No further action needed.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The overall security assessment remains very low risk, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a minimal security risk score.",
