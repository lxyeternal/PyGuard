  "purpose": "Utility functions for byte manipulation, type conversion, lease ID extraction, and response iteration.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions (byte_string, maybe_bytestring, lease, response_iterator).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external calls; functions perform local data processing only.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through simple transformations within each function; no external or network flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with clear logic and no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of basic utility functions performing safe operations: incrementing bytes, converting strings to bytes, extracting IDs, and iterating over response events. No external network calls, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no suspicious behavior are present. The functions handle data locally and securely. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No evidence suggests malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code with no malicious or suspicious activity. The low security risk scores are appropriate, and the malware and obfuscation scores should remain at 0. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety.",
