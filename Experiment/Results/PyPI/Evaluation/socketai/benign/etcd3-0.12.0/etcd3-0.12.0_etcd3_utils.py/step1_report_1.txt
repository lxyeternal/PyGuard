  "purpose": "Utility functions for byte manipulation, type conversion, lease ID extraction, and event iteration.",
  "sources": "Input data from byte strings, object attributes, and response iterators.",
  "sinks": "Potentially susceptible to data manipulation if input is untrusted, especially in byte operations and type conversions.",
  "flows": "Byte string input → increment_last_byte; String or bytes input → to_bytes; Lease object or ID → lease_to_id; Response iterator → response_to_event_iterator",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. Functions perform straightforward operations. No suspicious external connections or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple utility functions: increment_last_byte modifies the last byte of a byte string; to_bytes encodes strings to bytes if necessary; lease_to_id extracts an ID from a lease object or string; response_to_event_iterator converts nested response responses into events. All functions are standard and do not contain suspicious logic or data flows. No signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The functions are isolated, with no external network calls or unsafe data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and performs basic utility operations with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is unlikely to be involved in supply chain attacks or malicious activity.",
