  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate, standard implementation of a distributed lock using etcd3. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscation is detected. The low security risk score (0.2) reflects operational concerns rather than malicious threats. The malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0. The code is safe for use in production environments, with minor improvements possible for robustness."
