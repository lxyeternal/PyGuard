  "purpose": "Implement a distributed lock using etcd3 for coordination across multiple processes or systems.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (via uuid generation), accessing etcd key-value store, watching for events, and managing leases.",
  "sinks": "Writing to etcd key-value store, deleting keys, refreshing leases, and reading from etcd to check lock status.",
  "flows": "UUID generation (source) → Lock acquisition via etcd transaction (sink) → Lock release or refresh (sink) → Status check (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual or suspicious function calls. Use of uuid for lock identification is standard. The code properly manages lease and transaction logic.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard distributed lock pattern using etcd3 client. It employs UUIDs to uniquely identify the lock owner, manages lease renewal, and uses etcd transactions to ensure atomicity. Watchers are used to wait for lock release events. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activities are present. All interactions are typical for a distributed lock implementation. There are no signs of data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious behavior. The code follows typical design patterns and appears secure within its scope.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of a distributed lock using etcd3. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior. It does not perform any suspicious operations beyond its intended purpose. Overall, the code appears safe and legitimate.",
