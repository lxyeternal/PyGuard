  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific errors related to etcd3 interactions.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; class definitions and string representations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data leaks or untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flow; exception classes are for error handling only.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation, no malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from a base exception. Some classes override the __str__ method to provide specific error messages. The class RevisionCompactedError stores a compacted_revision attribute. There are no input reading, data processing, or external communications present. The structure appears standard for error handling in Python. No signs of malicious or suspicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists solely of standard exception class definitions for error handling related to etcd3. There are no indicators of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated code. It appears to be a straightforward, benign module.",
