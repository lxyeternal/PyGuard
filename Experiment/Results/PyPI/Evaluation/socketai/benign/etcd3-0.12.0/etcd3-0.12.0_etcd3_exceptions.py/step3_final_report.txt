  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling etcd3-related errors in Python.",
  "sources": "No input or external data sources; class definitions are static.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external communication points; purely exception class definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow; class instantiations and exception handling are standard and static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from a base exception, with some overriding __str__ methods. It is static, simple, and serves error handling purposes. No input reading, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code contains no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exception classes for etcd3 error handling. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is free from obfuscation. The current assessment and scores are accurate and do not require modification.",
