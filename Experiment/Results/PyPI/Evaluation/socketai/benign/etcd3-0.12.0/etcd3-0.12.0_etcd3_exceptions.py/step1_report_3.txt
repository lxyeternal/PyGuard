  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various errors related to etcd3 client operations.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and their methods; no external input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; code only defines exceptions and their string representations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; exception classes are used for error handling within an application.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code present. The __str__ methods are straightforward and appropriate.",
  "analysis": "The code provides custom exception classes for specific error scenarios related to etcd3 interactions, such as connection failures, timeouts, and server errors. The exception classes inherit from a base exception, and some override the __str__ method to provide specific error messages. There are no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns. The class definitions are standard Python practice for error handling. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code only defines error classes for etcd3-related exceptions without any malicious behavior or security risks. It is a straightforward implementation of custom exceptions for error handling in a Python application.",
