  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various errors related to etcd3 client operations.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines exception classes without reading input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or sensitive data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or input/output logic present.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward class definitions with no unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from a base Etcd3Exception. Some classes override __str__ methods to provide specific error messages. The RevisionCompactedError class stores a compacted_revision attribute. There is no input handling, external data processing, or dynamic code execution. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for etcd3 errors with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
