  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for etcd3 client error handling",
  "sources": "No external input sources; exception classes are defined statically",
  "sinks": "No sinks; exception messages are simple string representations or stored data",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources; no exception handling flow involves untrusted data",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward exception class definitions",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, tailored for etcd3 errors. Some classes override __str__ to provide custom error messages, while others simply inherit behavior. No external input, data reading, or insecure handling is present. No obfuscated code, no hidden payloads, no malicious instructions. The structure and content are typical for custom exception definitions. Overall, this code is a standard, benign pattern for error handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains standard, benign exception class definitions with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attack, or security risks.",
