{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific errors related to etcd3 client operations",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines exception classes without input or data reading",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or output involved",
  "flows": "None; no data flow from sources to sinks since it's only class definitions",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior; exception classes are standard",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions for etcd3-related errors. No input, output, or data processing occurs. The exception classes inherit from Python's built-in Exception class and include specific error messages or attributes. The structure is typical for error handling in Python modules and does not contain obfuscation, malicious logic, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes for etcd3 errors. It poses no security risks, malware, or suspicious behavior.",
