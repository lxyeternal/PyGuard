  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Review Summary:**\n- The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from a base `Etcd3Exception`.\n- Some classes override the `__str__` method to provide specific error messages.\n- The `RevisionCompactedError` class stores an attribute `compacted_revision`.\n- There are no input reads, data processing, external communications, or dynamic code execution.\n- The code appears to be standard for error handling in Python.\n\n**Assessment of the reports:**\n- All reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- They correctly identify that the code is solely for defining exception classes.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or security risks are detected.\n- The confidence level is high (1), and all scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are zero.\n\n**Confirmations and Concerns:**\n- The code does **not** contain any hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads.\n- The exception classes are typical and serve error handling purposes.\n- The `__str__` methods are straightforward and appropriate.\n- The `RevisionCompactedError` class's attribute is relevant to its purpose and not suspicious.\n\n**Scores and Justification:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate. No malicious behavior is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is appropriate. The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 is appropriate. No security risks are evident.\n\n**Overall,** the code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exceptions for etcd3 error handling.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nNo changes needed. The code is safe and typical for its purpose.\n\n**Note:** Always keep in mind that this is based solely on static code analysis. No runtime behavior or external context is available here.",
