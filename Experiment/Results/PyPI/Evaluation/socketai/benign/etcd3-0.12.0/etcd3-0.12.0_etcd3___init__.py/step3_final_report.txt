{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module that imports components from the 'etcd3' library and defines metadata and export symbols for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads static import statements and metadata definitions; no dynamic input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; the code only sets up imports and exports.",
  "flows": "The code flow is limited to static import and assignment operations; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static setup module that imports specific components from the 'etcd3' library and defines metadata and __all__ for public API exposure. It contains no runtime logic, data handling, network activity, or obfuscated constructs. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the benign nature of the code. No signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module setup with no malicious intent or security issues. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified based on the code's static and straightforward nature.",
