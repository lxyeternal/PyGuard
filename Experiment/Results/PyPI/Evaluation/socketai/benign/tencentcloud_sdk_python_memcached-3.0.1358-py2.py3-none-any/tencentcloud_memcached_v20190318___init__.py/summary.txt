  "obfuscated": 0.8,

  "conclusion": "The assessments across the reports are consistent and justified. The absence of code in reports 1-3 warrants zero scores. Report 4's benign description aligns with low risk and no malware. Report 5's suspicious patterns justify high obfuscation and malware scores, indicating a significant security concern. The overall evaluation suggests moderate concern primarily driven by report 5, with the current scores accurately reflecting the analyzed indicators."
