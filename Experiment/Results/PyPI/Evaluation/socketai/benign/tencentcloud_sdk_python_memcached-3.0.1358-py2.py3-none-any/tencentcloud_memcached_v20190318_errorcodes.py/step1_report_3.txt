{
  "purpose": "Define and assign string constants for various error codes and messages used in an application.",
  "sources": "Constants are assigned string literals within the code itself.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; constants are predefined static strings.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code merely assigns static string values to variables.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only static string assignments representing error codes for different failure scenarios. No external input handling, data processing, or dynamic behavior is present. The licensing comments and constant definitions are standard and straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or hidden code. The lack of any data input, network operations, or code execution mechanisms suggests this is a typical constants module. The license header indicates open-source licensing, further reducing suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a simple constants definition file for error codes, with no malicious behavior or security issues identified. It appears to be a benign part of a larger application.",
