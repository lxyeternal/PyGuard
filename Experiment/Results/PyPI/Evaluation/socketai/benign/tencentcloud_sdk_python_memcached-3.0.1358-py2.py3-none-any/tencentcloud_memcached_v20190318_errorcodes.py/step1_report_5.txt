{
  "purpose": "Define a set of constant error codes and messages for a Tencent-related service, primarily for handling exceptions and error states.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads external input or data; it only defines constant variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing, no data leaks, and no sinks for malicious data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks since the code only declares constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward constant declarations with licensing comments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of string constant definitions representing various error codes and messages used within a Tencent service or SDK. It includes licensing comments and does not contain any logic, data processing, or external input handling. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior. The constants are typical for error handling and do not reveal any secrets or credentials. No suspicious patterns or code behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard declaration of error code constants with licensing comments. It poses no security risks, malware, or malicious behavior. It appears to be a benign part of a larger SDK or codebase.",
