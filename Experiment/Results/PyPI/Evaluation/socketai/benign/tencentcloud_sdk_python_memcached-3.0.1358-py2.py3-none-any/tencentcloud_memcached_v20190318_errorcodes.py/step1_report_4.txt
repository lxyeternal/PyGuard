{
  "purpose": "Define a set of error codes and messages for a system, likely related to API responses or internal error handling.",
  "sources": "Constant assignments for error code variables.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; code only declares constants without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious indicators. The code appears standard for defining error constants.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of string constant definitions for various error messages and codes, accompanied by licensing and copyright comments. There are no input sources, data processing, or output sinks present. No functions, user inputs, network calls, or data manipulations are included. The code appears to serve as a static configuration or constants module for error handling. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward definition of error codes and messages for a system, with no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. It appears to be a benign component used for error reporting.",
