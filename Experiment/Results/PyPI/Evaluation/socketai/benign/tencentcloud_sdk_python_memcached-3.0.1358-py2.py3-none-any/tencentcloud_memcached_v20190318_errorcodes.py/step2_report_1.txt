  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to verify the claims and scores, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of static string constant definitions for error codes.\n- No functions, input handling, external data sources, or dynamic behavior are present.\n- Licensing comments are standard and do not indicate obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscated code are detected.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, aligning with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The security risk score is also 0, which is appropriate given the static nature of the code.\n\n**Specific Points:**\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, straightforward, and standard for error code definitions.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, which is justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- The scores assigned for malware and security risk are all 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Potential Issues or Discrepancies:**\n- The only aspect to consider is whether any of the error code constants could be exploited or indicate malicious intent. Given they are simple string constants with no dynamic behavior, this is unlikely.\n- The reports do not mention any hidden or embedded secrets, backdoors, or malicious payloads, which seems accurate.\n\n**Recommendations for Scores:**\n- The malware score of 0 is appropriate; no changes needed.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is appropriate.\n- The security risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is a benign constants module with no security concerns.\n- The high confidence levels are justified.\n\n**Final Justification:**\n- Given the static, straightforward nature of the code, there is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and should remain as-is.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Security risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the evidence provided.",
