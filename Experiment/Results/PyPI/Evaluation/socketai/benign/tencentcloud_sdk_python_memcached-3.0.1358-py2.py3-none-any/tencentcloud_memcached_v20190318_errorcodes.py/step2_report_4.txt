  "review": "Let's systematically analyze the reports and the code:\n\n1. **Code Content and Nature:**\n   - The code consists solely of string constant definitions for various error codes.\n   - It includes licensing comments at the top.\n   - There are no functions, input handling, data processing, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - The constants are static, hardcoded strings, typical for error handling modules.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - No network calls, code injection, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or embedded malware.\n   - No data flows from untrusted sources; only static constants are defined.\n\n3. **Security Risks and Malware:**\n   - The code is benign, serving as a constants module.\n   - No evidence of malicious intent or behavior.\n   - The malware score should be zero, consistent across all reports.\n\n4. **Obfuscation:**\n   - The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or complex constructs.\n   - Obfuscated score should be zero.\n\n5. **Risk Score Justification:**\n   - Since the code is purely static constant definitions with no external data handling or logic, the security risk should be minimal.\n   - All reports assign a risk score of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The scores for malware and obfuscated are also zero, aligning with the analysis.\n\n6. **Any Logical Flaws or Errors in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No overestimations of risk or malware presence.\n   - The reasoning is sound and justified.\n\n7. **Score Suggestions:**\n   - The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5 or below) are appropriate.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n8. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a typical constants file for error handling.\n   - No security vulnerabilities, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation.\n   - The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the nature of the code and the analysis provided.",
