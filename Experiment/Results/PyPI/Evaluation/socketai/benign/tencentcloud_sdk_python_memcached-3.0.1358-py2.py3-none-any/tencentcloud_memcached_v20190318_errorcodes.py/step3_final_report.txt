{
  "purpose": "Defines static string constants representing various error codes and messages for system, parameter, resource, and authorization errors.",
  "sources": "No data sources; only static constant definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; constants are used for error handling, not processing untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; constants are referenced elsewhere but do not process data themselves.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard licensing comments and static string definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string constants defining error codes, with no functions, input handling, or dynamic behavior. It includes licensing comments, which are standard. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns. The constants are typical for error handling modules and do not contain secrets or sensitive data. Given the static and benign nature, there are no security risks or malware indicators. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all appropriately zero. The code's simplicity and clarity support a high confidence that it is safe and non-malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static set of error code constants with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All assessments and scores are justified and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
