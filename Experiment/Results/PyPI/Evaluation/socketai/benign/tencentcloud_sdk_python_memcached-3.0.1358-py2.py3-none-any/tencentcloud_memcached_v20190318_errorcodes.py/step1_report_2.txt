{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of constant string error codes related to system errors, parameter issues, resource not found, and authorization failures, likely for use in an API or SDK for error handling.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from hardcoded string assignments defining error code constants.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks present; the code does not process untrusted input or data flows that could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input or data; the code solely assigns static string values to constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present; the code consists of straightforward constant definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code contains static definitions of error code constants used for error handling within a larger application. It includes licensing comments, copyright notices, and constant assignments. There are no input/output operations, data processing, or logic that could introduce security vulnerabilities. The absence of data processing, dynamic execution, or external data sources indicates that there are no security risks or malicious behaviors within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign set of constant definitions for error codes with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is straightforward and does not process or handle untrusted data, thus posing no security threat.",
