{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of string constants representing different error codes and messages, likely used for error handling in a larger system or application.",
  "sources": "Constants are defined directly in the code, with no external input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code only assigns string values to variables.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; these are static constant definitions.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The comments are standard licensing statements and error code definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of constant variable declarations representing error codes, with licensing comments at the top. There are no functions, input handling, or data processing. No malicious behaviors such as network access, data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are present. The structure and content are typical for error code definitions used in API or SDK development.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of error code constants with licensing comments. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
