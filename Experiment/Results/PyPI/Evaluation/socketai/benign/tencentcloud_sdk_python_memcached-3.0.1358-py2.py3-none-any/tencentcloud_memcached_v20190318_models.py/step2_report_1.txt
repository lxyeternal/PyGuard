  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports describe code that defines data models for API requests and responses, including deserialization, getters, setters, and warnings for unused fields.\n- There are no indications of code execution, network activity, or dynamic behavior.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are mentioned.\n- The code appears to be standard SDK or API client data modeling code.\n\n---\n\n### **Specific analysis per report:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Data structures for handling requests/responses.\n- Source/Sinks: Data flows only through deserialization into class attributes.\n- Anomalies: None; standard warnings for unused fields.\n- Conclusion: No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Fully consistent; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Request/response models for cloud instances.\n- Source/Sinks: Encapsulation of data, no external system interaction.\n- Anomalies: Standard pattern, no suspicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Safe, standard SDK code.\n- Confidence: 1.0\n- Malware: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Also consistent; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Data models for describing and responding to instance queries.\n- Source/Sinks: Data deserialized from external 'params' into class attributes.\n- Anomalies: Standard warnings, no malicious code.\n- Conclusion: No malicious or security risks.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; standard data modeling code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Data models for describing instances.\n- Source/Sinks: Deserialization from external input, no external system impact.\n- Anomalies: No malicious behavior, warnings are benign.\n- Conclusion: Typical SDK code, safe.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n\n**Assessment:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: API request/response data models.\n- Source/Sinks: Data flows into class attributes via deserialization.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious activity, standard warnings.\n- Conclusion: No signs of malicious code.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\n\n- **Code content:** All reports describe code that is purely data modeling for API interactions, with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malware.\n- **Scores:** The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, as expected.\n- **Risk scores:** Given the absence of any malicious or suspicious activity, the risk scores should be very low, close to 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at 0.\n- **Risk score:** Given the code is standard SDK modeling code with no security issues, a score of **0.0** is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Suggested Value | Justification                                               |\n|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware Score   | 0.0               | No malicious activity or code present.                        |\n| Obfuscated Score| 0.0               | Clear, standard code without obfuscation.                     |\n| Risk Score      | 0.0               | No security risks or vulnerabilities identified.            |\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent with the code being benign SDK data models, and no further security concerns are warranted based on this review.",
