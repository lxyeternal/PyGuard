{
  "purpose": "Define data structures for requesting and receiving information about cloud instances, including filtering options and detailed instance info.",
  "sources": "None explicitly reading untrusted input; data is encapsulated in class attributes populated via _deserialize method, typically from API responses or user input.",
  "sinks": "None present; the code does not directly output or transmit data outside its context.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., API responses) flow into _deserialize methods, populating object attributes; no data flows to external sinks within this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. Usage of warnings.warn for unused parameters is standard; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines request and response models for cloud instance data, with standard getter/setter properties and _deserialize methods. No external network calls, code execution, or malicious logic are implemented. The presence of licensing comments and import statements are benign. The code is well-structured, typical of SDKs or API client libraries, and does not contain any signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of data models for cloud API interactions, containing no malicious or malicious-suspected components. It appears safe, with no indicators of malware or security risks.",
