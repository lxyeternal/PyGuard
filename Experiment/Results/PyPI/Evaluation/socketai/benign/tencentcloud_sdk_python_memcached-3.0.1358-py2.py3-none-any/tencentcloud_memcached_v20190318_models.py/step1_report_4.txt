{
  "purpose": "Defines data models and request/response structures for describing instances in a Tencent Cloud service.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'tencentcloud.common.abstract_model'; class constructors and property setters/getters; '_deserialize' methods parsing input parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe assignment of input parameters to class attributes; use of warnings for unused parameters; no direct data leaks or malicious actions detected.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are deserialized into object attributes; data flows from external input (params) into class properties via '_deserialize' methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code; use of warnings for unused fields is standard practice; no obfuscated code or suspicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines classes with getters, setters, and deserialization methods. It imports from a known SDK module and follows standard patterns for data modeling. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or suspicious behaviors. The only notable feature is the '_deserialize' method issuing warnings for unused fields, which is common in API SDKs to alert about extraneous input. Overall, the code appears to be standard SDK/model code without malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical SDK data model implementation with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply structures API request and response data. No malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
