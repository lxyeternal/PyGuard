{
  "purpose": "These code snippets define data models for API request and response handling, including deserialization, property accessors, and warnings for unused fields. They serve as SDK or client library components for interacting with cloud services.",
  "sources": "Data is read from external 'params' dictionaries during deserialization, and from method parameters when setting properties.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data flows to untrusted sources; data is only assigned to class attributes from deserialized input.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external input (params) into class attributes via _deserialize methods; no external system interaction or network activity occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Warnings for unused fields are standard in SDK code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of data model classes with properties, setters, and _deserialize methods. Deserialization pulls data from input dictionaries, with warnings for extraneous keys. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or obfuscation are present. The code is typical SDK pattern, safe and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard SDK data modeling code with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score should be very low, approximately 0.0, reflecting its benign nature.",
