  "purpose": "Define data models for describing and responding to instance query requests within a Tencent Cloud SDK.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in class constructors, property setters, and the '_deserialize' methods reading data from external 'params' dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "Data assignment to class attributes, including potential for malicious data injection if external data is untrusted, but no unsafe operations or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "External data from 'params' sources flows into class attributes via '_deserialize' methods, but no further propagation to sinks such as system calls, network, or file I/O is observed.",
  "anomalies": "Code includes standard data modeling patterns with no signs of obfuscation, suspicious dynamic code execution, or hidden backdoors. Warning messages in '_deserialize' warn about unused fields but are benign. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions for request and response data structures, with properties, setters, and '_deserialize' methods to populate attributes from external dictionaries. There is no code execution, network activity, or manipulation of system resources. The only dynamic behavior involves warnings about extraneous data in input dictionaries, which is a common pattern for robust data validation. The code does not include any suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard SDK model code for handling request and response data. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The use of warnings for unused fields is benign and typical for such data classes. No signs of malware, supply chain sabotage, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
