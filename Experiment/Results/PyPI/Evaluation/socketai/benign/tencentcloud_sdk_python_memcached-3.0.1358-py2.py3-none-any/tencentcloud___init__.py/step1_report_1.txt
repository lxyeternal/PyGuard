{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set metadata for a Python package, including licensing information, version number, and licensing details.",
  "sources": "Comments and license headers; no runtime input or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks since the code consists solely of comments and metadata assignments.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious constructs; only licensing comments and a version variable.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is primarily metadata with licensing information and a version string. It does not perform any operations, input/output, or data processing. The only variable '__version__' is a string assignment. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign header or metadata fragment for a Python package. It contains licensing comments and a version declaration with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
