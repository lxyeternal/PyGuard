  "sources": "Data sources may include environment variables, user input functions, or external files/readers, but the code is not visible to identify exact sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, file write operations, or system commands, but cannot be confirmed without code details.",
  "flows": "Source-to-sink flows cannot be determined without specific code segments indicating data flow paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be identified due to lack of code visibility. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious patterns, or obfuscated sections are evident from the provided input.",
  "analysis": "Insufficient information is available to analyze code content, structure, or behavior. No specific source, sink, or flow can be identified, nor anomalies detected without the actual code.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The provided input does not contain any code to evaluate.",
