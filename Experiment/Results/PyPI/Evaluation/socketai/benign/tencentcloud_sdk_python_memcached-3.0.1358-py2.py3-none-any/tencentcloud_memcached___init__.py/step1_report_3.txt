{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing or transformation tasks, but without additional context, its specific purpose cannot be definitively determined.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters, user inputs via input() calls, or file reads (if any).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network transmissions (e.g., socket or HTTP requests), file writes, or execution of system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) through processing functions, potentially ending at sinks such as network, file system, or system execution points.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, suspicious URLs, or obfuscated code detected. No unusual or malicious patterns found in structure or syntax.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward with standard Python constructs. It does not invoke dynamic execution, nor does it contain obfuscated or misleading code. Usage of third-party libraries is typical and does not imply malicious intent. No suspicious data handling or command execution observed. The code reads inputs and processes them without evident malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the current code review, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears benign with no signs of malware or supply chain attacks.",
