  "purpose": "This code appears to perform data processing and possibly interacts with network resources, but the exact purpose is unclear due to lack of comments and context.",
  "sources": "Potential input sources include environment variables, user inputs, or external data files.",
  "sinks": "Possible sinks include network communication functions, file writes, or system commands that could send data externally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or inputs to sinks like network functions or file operations, potentially passing through processing steps.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation detected. No unusual code constructs or suspicious dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, focusing on data manipulation without complex control flow. No suspicious hardcoded secrets or malicious API calls are evident. Use of third-party libraries is standard. No signs of data exfiltration, reverse shells, or unauthorized system modifications. The structure and formatting are typical of legitimate scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not show signs of malicious behavior or malware. It appears to be a normal data processing script with no evident security risks based on the provided code.",
