{
  "purpose": "The code defines a function to process data, either as a pandas DataFrame or a dictionary, applying a schema's UDFs for data enhancement or transformation.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'data' (pandas DataFrame or dictionary), 'schema' (optional UdfSchema object), and internal calls to 'schema.apply_udfs'.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly. The code does not send data over the network or write to files. It simply processes data internally.",
  "flows": "Input 'data' is checked for type; if DataFrame, passed to 'schema.apply_udfs(pandas=)', if dict, passed to 'schema.apply_udfs(row=)'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no external network activities are present.",
  "analysis": "The code validates input types and applies schema-defined UDFs accordingly. It handles different input types safely, raising an exception for unsupported types. No security issues or malicious behavior are apparent. The use of 'schema.apply_udfs' suggests data transformation within a controlled schema context. No obfuscation, malicious code, or abnormal behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward data processing utility with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It is a benign implementation focused on data transformation based on schemas.",
