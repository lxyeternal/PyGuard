{
  "purpose": "The code defines a function to extract and process data using a schema, supporting pandas DataFrame and dictionary inputs.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'data' (from caller), 'schema' (optional, defaulted internally).",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that lead to data leakage or system compromise; no untrusted data handling that triggers side effects like network, file, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input 'data' to schema application functions, which process and return enhanced data; no external outputs or side effects are observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or unusual code patterns. The use of a schema application from an external library ('whylogs') appears standard. No obfuscation or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and a specific schema module. It defines an 'extract' function supporting pandas DataFrame and dictionary inputs. If 'schema' is not provided, it initializes a default schema. It applies 'apply_udfs' method from the schema object to the data, returning processed results. The code performs input validation and raises an exception for unsupported types. No code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior detected. External library usage ('whylogs') is typical for schema application. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data flows identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward data processing utility with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It safely applies schemas to data inputs, with no indications of malicious or harmful actions.",
