{
  "purpose": "The code defines an 'extract' function that processes input data (pandas DataFrame or dict) using a schema's 'apply_udfs' method, returning enhanced data.",
  "sources": "Input data: pandas DataFrame or dictionary; external dependency 'schema.apply_udfs()'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communication; internal processing only.",
  "flows": "Data is passed from input parameters to 'schema.apply_udfs()' with appropriate arguments, then returned.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward data validation and applies external schema functions without any network activity, code injection, or obfuscation. It relies on trusted external libraries and performs minimal processing. No malicious or security-compromising behavior is evident within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and free of malicious intent or obfuscation. External schema application is a potential external risk but not evidenced here. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk.",
