{
  "purpose": "The code loads regex patterns and entity data from external JSON files for pattern matching and entity recognition.",
  "sources": "File reading operations using open() on paths specified in configuration variables (pattern_file_path and pii_entities_file_path).",
  "sinks": "None identified that lead to data leaks or untrusted data effects directly; no data is written or transmitted over networks.",
  "flows": "Data is read from files and loaded into internal data structures; no flow from untrusted sources to sinks is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or backdoors, are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs standard file I/O operations to load JSON data, with appropriate exception handling for missing files and JSON decoding errors. It uses compiled regex patterns for efficiency but does not execute or evaluate untrusted code. No network, cryptography, or system modification functions are present. The design is consistent with configuration-driven pattern loading, and no malicious or malicious-looking code is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, secure pattern and entity loader with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It does not handle untrusted inputs beyond file reading, and there are no suspicious behaviors or security risks detected.",
