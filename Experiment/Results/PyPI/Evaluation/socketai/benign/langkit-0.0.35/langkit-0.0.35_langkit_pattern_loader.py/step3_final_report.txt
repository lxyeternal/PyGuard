  "purpose": "Load regex patterns and PII entities from external JSON files, compile regex expressions, and store data for further processing.",
  "sources": "File I/O operations reading from 'pattern_file_path' and 'pii_entities_file_path' specified in configuration.",
  "sinks": "None; data is loaded and stored internally without external output or network activity.",
  "flows": "JSON files are read, parsed, and data is stored in class attributes; no untrusted data is executed or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or behavior; exception handling is appropriate; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard configuration loading: it reads JSON files, compiles regex patterns, and stores entities. Exception handling manages missing or malformed files. No dynamic execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The logic is straightforward and aligns with typical pattern/entity loader modules. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured data loader for regex patterns and entities. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports' assessments are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.",
