  "purpose": "The code defines a dataset UDF for computing similarity between prompts and responses using a transformer encoder model.",
  "sources": "Reads data from input dictionary with keys 'prompt' and 'response'. Loads and initializes transformer encoder models.",
  "sinks": "Uses the model to encode text and compute cosine similarity. No data leaks or sensitive outputs directly evident.",
  "flows": "Inputs (prompt and response) are fed into the encoder to generate embeddings, then cosine similarity is calculated.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors observed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or unusual data handling.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes a transformer model and registers a UDF to compute similarity scores between prompt-response pairs. It handles exceptions gracefully and logs warnings. The use of external libraries appears standard and appropriate. No signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code focuses solely on similarity computation without any network or system modification operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for calculating text similarity using a transformer encoder. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
