  "purpose": "Compute cosine similarity between prompt-response pairs using a transformer encoder within a dataset UDF.",
  "sources": "Prompt and response columns in the input data",
  "sinks": "Returns a list of similarity scores; no external data leaks or network calls",
  "flows": "Reads prompt and response data, encodes each, computes cosine similarity, logs warnings on errors",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external network activity observed",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a transformer model globally, registers a UDF to compute similarity, handles exceptions gracefully, and performs in-memory NLP similarity calculations. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk 0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign, standard NLP utility. No logical flaws or vulnerabilities are identified. The code's operations are limited to in-memory processing without external communication or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign NLP utility for prompt-response similarity measurement. It contains no malicious or obfuscated elements. The current security scores are appropriate and consistent with its functionality. No changes are necessary.",
