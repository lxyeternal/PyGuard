  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Defines a UDF for computing cosine similarity between prompt-response pairs.\n- Uses a global transformer encoder, initialized via `init()`.\n- Handles errors gracefully with logging.\n- No suspicious or malicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or external data leaks are evident.\n- The logic is straightforward and typical for NLP similarity tasks.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All describe the code as a benign NLP utility for similarity computation.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- The code relies on standard libraries (`sentence_transformers`, `langkit`, `whylogs`) in a typical manner.\n- Error handling and data flow are standard.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or external network activity is reported or observed.\n\n**Scores:**\n- **Malware:** consistently 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk:** very low (0.1 to 0.2), justified by the benign nature of the code.\n- **Confidence:** high (0.9 or 1), reflecting strong consensus.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code appears legitimate; no vulnerabilities, malicious intent, or suspicious behavior are evident.\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning:** No logical errors or flawed reasoning are identified.\n- **Score consistency:** All reports assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk, which aligns with the code's content.\n- **Potential for higher risk:** Since the code only performs NLP similarity calculations, there's no basis for higher malware or security risk scores.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0**, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at **0**, no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk score:** Given the benign nature, a **risk score of 0.1** is appropriate, possibly slightly higher than the lowest if considering potential misuse, but overall very low.\n\n**Note:** The code does not perform any external network calls, data exfiltration, or system modifications. It solely encodes text and computes cosine similarity.\n\n---\n\n### **Final estimate:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---|---|---|\n| **0** | **0** | **0.1** |\n\nThis reflects a benign, well-structured NLP utility with no security concerns.",
