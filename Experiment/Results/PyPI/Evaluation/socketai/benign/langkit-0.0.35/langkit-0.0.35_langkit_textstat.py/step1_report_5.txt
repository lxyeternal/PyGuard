{
  "purpose": "This code defines and registers text analysis metrics using the textstat library, for use in a larger data processing pipeline. It sets up functions to compute various readability scores and metrics.",
  "sources": "Code imports modules (logging, typing, textstat, custom modules), reads data from parameters (text columns), and reads configuration from an optional config parameter.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include registration of UDFs which could be invoked on untrusted data, but no direct data leakage or system command execution is observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input datasets/columns through wrapper functions that call textstat methods, then registered as UDFs for later invocation within data pipelines.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. Use of standard text analysis libraries with no dynamic code execution or obfuscation. The registration process is straightforward. No unusual or malicious behavior identified.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and sets up a list of text metric definitions. Wrapper functions dynamically invoke textstat methods on input data columns. It registers these functions as UDFs for later use, applying them to specified columns. The registration process appears to be standard, with no signs of malicious intent. The code is structured cleanly, with no obfuscated or suspicious patterns. The only potentially risky aspect is the registration of UDFs which could be misused if invoked with malicious data downstream, but this is standard practice in data pipelines.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, intended for registering text analysis functions in a data pipeline. It does not contain malware, malicious behaviors, or security risks. The structure and implementation are standard, with no signs of sabotage or malicious activity.",
