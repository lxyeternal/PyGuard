{
  "purpose": "Register a set of readability and linguistic metrics as user-defined functions (UDFs) for dataset columns to facilitate text analysis.",
  "sources": "Dataset columns 'prompt_column' and 'response_column' during UDF registration; data inputs to the wrapped functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential processing of untrusted data within the registered functions; no external data sinks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from dataset columns into the wrapper functions, which invoke 'textstat' metrics, with registration linking these functions to columns.",
  "anomalies": "The '_unpack' function defaults the third tuple element to the first if only two elements are provided; benign and typical for flexible tuple handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a list of readability metrics, creates wrapper functions invoking 'textstat' methods, and registers these as UDFs for specific dataset columns. It uses standard libraries and patterns, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. The registration process is straightforward, and the code performs no external network calls, file modifications, or system commands. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign, standard nature of the code. No logical flaws or suspicious patterns are evident, and the code's purpose aligns with typical data pipeline practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured setup for registering text analysis UDFs. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. The low malware and risk scores are justified, and the code can be considered benign and appropriate for its intended purpose.",
