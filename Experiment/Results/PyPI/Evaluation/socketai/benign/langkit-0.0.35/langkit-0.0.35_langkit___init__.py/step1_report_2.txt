{
  "purpose": "This code defines configuration data structures, resource path utilities, and package version retrieval functions for a language processing package.",
  "sources": "Resource path functions (_resource_filename), default values for configuration fields, package version retrieval via importlib.metadata",
  "sinks": "None identified that process untrusted user input or data; no data sinks for untrusted input or output operations",
  "flows": "No flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; configuration defaults are static or derived from package resources",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors present; use of standard library and resource functions appears normal",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of data class definitions, resource path utilities, and version retrieval logic. No user input handling, network communication, or data leaks are present. Resource paths are generated using the standard importlib.resources module, and package versioning is handled safely. There are no indicators of malicious activity or sabotage. The code is straightforward and adheres to common patterns for configuration and package management.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It is standard in structure and purpose, focusing on configuration management and package info retrieval without any suspicious or malicious actions.",
