  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically, considering the code, its context, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward configuration module, defining data classes, resource path resolution, and package version retrieval.\n- All reports agree that there are no signs of malicious activity, data leaks, or suspicious behavior.\n- The only external resource URL is a public S3 bucket, which appears legitimate.\n- No untrusted user input handling, network communication (besides reading resources), or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The code uses standard Python libraries and practices.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed review of each report:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; standard practices, no malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity; resource URLs seem legitimate.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.1), but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n- **Justification:** The minimal score might be a conservative default or an overly cautious estimate, but given the code's nature, it is not justified.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Verdict:** Should be lowered to 0, consistent with other reports.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Assessment:** Same as others; standard configuration code.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Verdict:** Should also be lowered to 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusions:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Most reports assign 0, except Reports 4 and 5, which assign 0.1. Given the absence of vulnerabilities, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior, these should be 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1 in all cases; the analysis is consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- **Adjust the securityRisk scores in reports 4 and 5 from 0.1 to 0.**  \n- **Overall malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate at 0.**\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0 (since no vulnerabilities or malicious activity are present)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard configuration setup with no security issues. The slight elevation in securityRisk scores in some reports is unwarranted and should be corrected to 0 for consistency.",
