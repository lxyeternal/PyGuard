{
  "purpose": "Define configuration data structures and utility functions for language processing tasks, including resource path resolution and package version retrieval.",
  "sources": "Resource paths via importlib.resources, default values, and package version via importlib.metadata.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data output or data leak points identified.",
  "flows": "N/A – static configuration and resource path resolution without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior observed. Usage of resource path functions and package metadata retrieval are standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dataclass for configuration with default factory methods that resolve resource paths relative to the package, which is standard. The package_version function retrieves package version info safely using importlib.metadata, handling exceptions properly. No input/output streams, network connections, or dynamic code execution are present. No hardcoded credentials or malicious behaviors detected. The code appears to be straightforward configuration setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration and utility module with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It primarily manages file paths and version info for the package.",
