  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to determine the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is primarily configuration: data classes, resource path resolution, and package version retrieval.\n- No user input handling, network communication, dynamic code execution, or data leaks are present.\n- The resource paths are resolved via importlib.resources, which is standard.\n- The package version retrieval via importlib.metadata is safe and handled with exception handling.\n- The only external URL is a public S3 bucket for injections, which appears legitimate.\n- No suspicious or malicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors are detected.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of each report:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- *Assessment:* No suspicious behavior, standard practices.\n- *Scores:* malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- *Conclusion:* Accurate, consistent.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- *Assessment:* Similar to Report 1, no issues.\n- *Scores:* malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- *Conclusion:* Accurate, consistent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- *Assessment:* Same as above, no malicious activity.\n- *Scores:* malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- *Conclusion:* Accurate, consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- *Assessment:* Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.1). The reasoning states that resource path handling and package version retrieval are standard, with no suspicious behavior.\n- *Scores:* malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- *Justification:* Given the code's benign nature, a 0.1 security risk seems overstated. It could be justified if considering that resource handling might expose some minimal risk if resources are tampered with, but as-is, it's negligible.\n- *Recommendation:* The securityRisk score should likely be 0, aligning with the other reports and the code's benign nature.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- *Assessment:* Similar to others, no malicious activity.\n- *Scores:* malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- *Justification:* Same as above; the 0.1 security risk appears unjustified given the code.\n- *Recommendation:* Reduce to 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Malware and Obfuscated Scores:**\n- All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious or obfuscated code is present.\n\n### **Overall conclusions:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward configuration module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The minor securityRisk scores of 0.1 in Reports 4 and 5 are likely overestimations given the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n| Metric            | Estimated Score |\n|-------------------|-----------------|\n| Malware           | 0               |\n| Obfuscated        | 0               |\n| Security Risk     | 0               |\n\n**Note:** The malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0, as there's no evidence of malicious or obfuscated code. The security risk should also be 0, given the benign and standard nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- All code snippets are standard configuration and utility functions.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behaviors detected.\n- The minor securityRisk scores of 0.1 in some reports should be adjusted to 0 for consistency and accuracy.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Set malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 across all reports.",
