{
  "purpose": "The code defines configuration data structures and functions for resource handling and version retrieval within a Python package, primarily related to language processing and model configuration.",
  "sources": "Resource path functions (_resource_filename), package version retrieval (package_version), and default field values in the LangKitConfig dataclass.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data exfiltration points are evident; the code does not send data externally or handle untrusted input directly.",
  "flows": "Resource filename functions read package resources; package_version reads package metadata. No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic are present. The code appears standard for configuration management.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up configuration defaults, resource path resolution, and package versioning. It uses standard library features and predictable external resource URLs. There are no indications of data leaks, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. The only external data URL is a public S3 bucket for injections, which appears legitimate given context, and there are no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical configuration and resource management module with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and intended for normal package operations.",
