{
  "purpose": "Defines configuration data structures and utility functions for language processing, including resource path handling and package version retrieval.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata, resource files (JSON files), and package name for versioning.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that process untrusted data; no data output or external communication functions are present.",
  "flows": "Resource file paths are generated via _resource_filename; package version is retrieved from package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Use of importlib.resources for resource handling appears standard; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages configuration via dataclasses, dynamically constructs resource file paths, and retrieves package version info. All operations are standard for package configuration and metadata handling. No input from untrusted sources is processed, and no external data transmission or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration and utility module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It manages resource paths and package version info securely and without suspicious logic.",
