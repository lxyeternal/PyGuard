{
  "purpose": "Defines configuration data structures and utility functions for a language processing package.",
  "sources": "Imports from dataclasses, typing, local extract module, importlib.resources, and package variables.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks for untrusted data or external outputs. The only external data accessed is via resource paths and package version info.",
  "flows": "Resource paths and package version info are read, but not used to execute or transmit data externally.",
  "anomalies": "Use of importlib.resources.path to access package data is standard; no suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines dataclasses and default configuration paths pointing to resource files within the package. It retrieves the package version via importlib.metadata, which is typical. No evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration. No insecure code patterns, such as unsafe eval, network connections, or credential leaks, are present. The functions and data structures serve standard configuration purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign configuration module with standard resource access patterns. No signs of malicious behavior or malware detected. It follows typical package setup practices.",
