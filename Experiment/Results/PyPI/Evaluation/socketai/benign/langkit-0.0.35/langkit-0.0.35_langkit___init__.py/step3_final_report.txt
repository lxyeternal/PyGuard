{
  "purpose": "This code defines configuration data structures, resource path resolution, and package version retrieval for a language processing toolkit.",
  "sources": "Resource files such as 'pattern_groups.json', 'PII_entities.json', 'themes.json', and package metadata via importlib.metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external data processing occurs.",
  "flows": "Resource path functions and package version retrieval access local resources and package metadata without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard resource handling and configuration setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static configuration module utilizing standard Python libraries for resource management and versioning. No dynamic code execution, user input, or network communication is present. External URL references are to a public S3 bucket, which appears legitimate. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk scores are minimal (0 or 0.1), justified by external resource references but not indicative of actual risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and free of security vulnerabilities or malicious intent. The minor security risk scores are slightly overestimated and should be adjusted to zero for accuracy.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
