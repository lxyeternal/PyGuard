{
  "purpose": "This code defines sentiment analysis functions using the VaderSentiment library for processing prompt and response texts within a dataset, registering these functions as UDFs for use in a data pipeline.",
  "sources": "The code reads input text data from the 'text' parameter passed to 'vader_sentiment', and the dataset fields '_prompt' and '_response' via the registered UDFs.",
  "sinks": "Potentially returns sentiment scores based on input data; no direct data leaks or external outputs are performed, but sentiment analysis results could be used downstream.",
  "flows": "Input text from dataset fields (_prompt and _response) flows into the 'vader_sentiment' function, which uses a lazily initialized SentimentIntensityAnalyzer to generate scores, which are then returned.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The code initializes the sentiment analyzer on demand, which is standard. No suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard logging and sentiment analysis libraries, defines a lazy-initialized sentiment analyzer instance, and registers UDFs for dataset fields. The 'vader_sentiment' function initializes the analyzer only once, which is a common pattern. No input validation, security-sensitive data handling, or external connections are present. The code appears straightforward and primarily designed for dataset processing without any signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of sentiment analysis functions with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It processes dataset text fields to compute sentiment scores using VaderSentiment, with proper lazy initialization. No security risks or malware are detected.",
