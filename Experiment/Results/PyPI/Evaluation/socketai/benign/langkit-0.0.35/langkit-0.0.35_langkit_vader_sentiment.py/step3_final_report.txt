  "purpose": "Performs sentiment analysis on dataset columns using VaderSentiment with lazy initialization.",
  "sources": "Input dataset columns (_prompt and _response) via dataset UDFs.",
  "sinks": "None; no external network or data exfiltration occurs.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from dataset columns into vader_sentiment function, which uses the initialized SentimentIntensityAnalyzer to compute scores.",
  "anomalies": "Use of global variable for analyzer; no suspicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries, defines a lazy-initialized sentiment analyzer, and registers UDFs for dataset columns. It performs local sentiment analysis without external calls or malicious patterns. No obfuscation, secrets, or network activity are present. The use of global state is typical for performance. The code is straightforward, readable, and aligns with benign sentiment analysis tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, benign, and performs standard sentiment analysis without malicious intent or security risks. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 used in some reports is conservative; a score of 0 is more accurate given the benign nature.",
