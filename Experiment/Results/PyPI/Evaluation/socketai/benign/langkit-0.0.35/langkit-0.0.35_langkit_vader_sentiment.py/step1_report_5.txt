{
  "purpose": "The code computes sentiment analysis scores for prompts and responses using the VaderSentiment library, and registers these as dataset UDFs.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from text fields (_prompt and _response) in the dataset passed to the UDFs.",
  "sinks": "The sentiment scores are returned as lists; no external sinks or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "flows": "Input text from dataset fields flows into the vader_sentiment function, which uses a singleton sentiment analyzer instance to compute scores, then returns results.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. The sentiment analyzer is initialized once and reused; no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sentiment analysis libraries and logging. It defines functions to initialize a sentiment analyzer instance and apply it to dataset columns. The singleton pattern is used for efficiency. The UDFs process text data and return sentiment scores. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The code appears straightforward and standard for sentiment analysis tasks.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs sentiment analysis in a typical manner without any malicious behavior or security risks. No indicators of sabotage or malware are evident. The code is safe based on its current structure.",
