{
  "purpose": "The code performs sentiment analysis using the VaderSentiment library and registers functions as UDFs for dataset processing.",
  "sources": "The code reads input text data from dataset columns (_prompt and _response). It also reads logs via diagnostic_logger.info().",
  "sinks": "The code outputs sentiment scores as lists of floats. No direct data leaks or untrusted data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input data from dataset columns flows through vader_sentiment() to produce sentiment scores; logs may record initialization messages.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors are present. Initialization message is logged if the analyzer is not initialized. No hardcoded credentials or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a sentiment analysis function using VaderSentiment, with lazy initialization to avoid repeated setup. It registers UDFs for dataset processing. It logs initialization but does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or malicious activity. No obfuscation or suspicious code constructs are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of sentiment analysis with dataset UDF registration. It contains no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
