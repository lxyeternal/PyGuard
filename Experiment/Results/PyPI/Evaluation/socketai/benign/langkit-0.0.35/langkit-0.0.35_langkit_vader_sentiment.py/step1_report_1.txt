{
  "purpose": "The code provides sentiment analysis functions using the VaderSentiment library, registered as UDFs for datasets involving prompts and responses.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from dataset columns accessed via text[_prompt] and text[_response]. The init() function initializes the sentiment analyzer.",
  "sinks": "The sentiment analysis results are returned as numerical scores; no direct data leaks or external data transmissions are evident.",
  "flows": "Input dataset columns flow into vader_sentiment(), which uses the sentiment analyzer to produce scores. The results flow back to the dataset via registered UDFs.",
  "anomalies": "The sentiment analyzer is lazily initialized and stored in a module-level global variable, which is typical. No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or suspicious behaviors are present. No obfuscated code or external connections.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and third-party sentiment analysis tools. It defines global variables and initializes a sentiment analyzer instance when first needed, avoiding reinitialization. UDFs process dataset columns to produce sentiment scores. The code is straightforward, with clear purpose and no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. No external network calls, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs sentiment analysis using VaderSentiment library, registered as dataset UDFs. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected. It appears to be standard, benign code for sentiment scoring.",
