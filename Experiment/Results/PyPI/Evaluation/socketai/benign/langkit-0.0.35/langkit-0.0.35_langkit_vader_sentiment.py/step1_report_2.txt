  "purpose": "To analyze text data for sentiment using the VaderSentiment library within a dataset processing framework.",
  "sources": "Input text data from the dataset columns specified by _prompt and _response.",
  "sinks": "The sentiment scores are returned as lists, but no untrusted data is written or transmitted elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Input text is read from dataset columns, processed by vader_sentiment function, and sentiment scores are generated without external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code behaviors detected. The initialization log message is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary libraries, defines functions for sentiment analysis with lazy initialization of the analyzer, and registers UDFs for dataset columns. It uses global variables and simple function calls. No external network, file access, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign sentiment analysis utility with proper structure and no malicious intent. It performs standard sentiment scoring without harmful behavior.",
