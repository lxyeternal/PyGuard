{
  "purpose": "Define functions to register NLP score computation UDFs based on provided configurations, utilizing evaluate library for metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR.",
  "sources": "Imports (deepcopy, typing, evaluate, langkit, getLogger), global variables (_corpus, _scores, _rouge_type), function parameters, evaluate.load() calls within functions.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data is written to files, sent over network, or used in system commands.",
  "flows": "init() updates global variables then calls _register_score_udfs(), which conditionally registers UDFs using evaluate.load() and decorators; no data flows from external sources into untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Potential logical error in rouge_score() where the variable 'text' is used instead of 'response' when computing rouge scores; no malicious activity but indicates a coding mistake.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup for NLP evaluation metrics with flexible configuration. It loads evaluate metrics lazily upon registration, using global variables for configuration. No external input is directly processed in a vulnerable way; the only dynamic aspect involves loading models and registering UDFs. No indications of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. The potential bug in rouge_score() function does not imply malicious intent but could affect functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This code is designed to register NLP evaluation UDFs based on configuration. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware. The only concern is a probable bug in the rouge_score function, not a security risk. Overall, the code appears benign with no security threats detected.",
