{
  "purpose": "The code registers UDFs for evaluating text responses using NLP metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR, based on configuration and data input.",
  "sources": "Data inputs include 'text' (responses) and '_corpus' (reference corpus).",
  "sinks": "The code computes NLP scores and returns lists of results; no data is transmitted externally or stored.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input 'text' through compute functions for BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, and results are returned as lists.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are evident. Functions perform expected NLP score calculations. The 'text' parameter in functions is used unmodified for score computation; no obfuscated or dynamic code execution is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup to register NLP scoring UDFs dynamically based on configuration. It loads evaluation models and registers functions that compute scores for responses against a reference corpus. The code appears standard in design, with proper conditional checks and logging. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection. The use of evaluate.load and UDF registration is consistent with typical NLP evaluation workflows. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate NLP evaluation utility with no malicious intent. It dynamically registers scoring functions based on configuration, with standard use of evaluate library. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected.",
