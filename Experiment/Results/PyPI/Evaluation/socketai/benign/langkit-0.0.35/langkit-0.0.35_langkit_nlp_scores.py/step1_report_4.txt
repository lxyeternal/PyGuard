{
  "purpose": "The code registers evaluation metric functions (BLEU, ROUGE, Meteor) as UDFs for dataset processing, based on provided configurations.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration variables (_corpus, _scores, _rouge_type), and input data via the 'text' parameter in the registered UDFs.",
  "sinks": "Uses evaluate.load() to load metric evaluation modules; computes scores with the loaded models; potentially exposes evaluation results.",
  "flows": "Configuration variables influence which scoring functions are registered; registered UDFs process input data to compute scores.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. UDFs dynamically load models based on string inputs. The code contains a potential bug where 'text' is used as both the dataset and input parameter, which could lead to logical errors but not malicious behavior. No evidence of code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically loads evaluation models (BLEU, ROUGE, Meteor) based on configuration and registers UDFs for dataset scoring. The models are loaded from the 'evaluate' library, which is standard. The registration depends on score strings containing specific keywords. No external network calls are evident outside the evaluate.load() function, which is a library call. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code patterns are present. Potential logical error in 'rouge_score' function where 'predictions=[text]' is used instead of 'predictions=[response]', but this appears to be a coding bug rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate evaluation metric registration based on configuration with no evidence of malicious behavior. The primary concern is a logical bug in 'rouge_score' that might affect correctness but does not introduce security risks. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.",
