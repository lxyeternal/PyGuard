  "purpose": "Initialize various modules from 'langkit' and 'whylogs', attach schema metadata, and return the schema object.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'langkit', 'whylogs', and 'langkit.metadata'; calls to init functions of modules; invocation of 'udf_schema()' and 'attach_schema_metadata()'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process external input or output data in a way that could lead to leaks or vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Module imports -> init functions with optional config -> udf_schema() -> attach_schema_metadata() -> return schema.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no network activity, and no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward initialization of multiple modules, attaching schema metadata, and returning the schema object. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code's simplicity and clarity support a benign assessment. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the code's nature. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign initialization routine with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, and the malware likelihood is effectively zero. The assessments across the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
