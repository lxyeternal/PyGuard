{
  "purpose": "Initializes various modules of the langkit library and attaches schema metadata to a user-defined schema.",
  "sources": "Imports modules from 'typing', 'whylogs', and 'langkit' libraries; calls functions from these modules.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any data sinks or untrusted data handling points; primarily initialization functions.",
  "flows": "Imports and initializes modules, then attaches metadata to a schema object.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The init function simply initializes modules and attaches metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various modules, calls initialization functions for each, and attaches schema metadata. All actions are standard for setting up a schema with language processing modules. No signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The structure appears to be straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup routine for initializing language processing modules and attaching metadata, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
