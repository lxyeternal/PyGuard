  "purpose": "Initialize various modules from the langkit library and attach schema metadata to a user-defined schema.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules from 'whylogs.experimental.core.udf_schema', 'whylogs.core.schema', 'langkit', and its submodules.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or external outputs within the provided code.",
  "flows": "The 'init' function calls multiple 'init' methods of langkit modules, then attaches schema metadata to a schema object, and returns it.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. All function calls appear standard for initialization routines.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several modules, most from 'langkit', and calls their 'init' functions with an optional configuration parameter. It then calls 'udf_schema()' to generate a schema and attaches metadata to it using 'attach_schema_metadata'. The process appears straightforward and intended for setting up schema configurations. No external network communication, data exfiltration, or obfuscated logic detected. The use of imports from known libraries and a clear initialization pattern suggests legitimate intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to perform standard initialization of a schema-related configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply sets up modules and attaches metadata as expected in a typical schema setup process.",
