{
  "purpose": "The code initializes various modules of the langkit package and attaches schema metadata, likely for processing or analyzing text data.",
  "sources": "The code reads optional configuration data from the 'config' parameter passed to the 'init' function.",
  "sinks": "The code calls 'attach_schema_metadata' with the schema and a string identifier, potentially influencing schema metadata.",
  "flows": "Input 'config' flows into multiple module init functions; then the output schema is processed by 'attach_schema_metadata'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code structure appears standard for module initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple modules from 'langkit' and a schema from 'whylogs'. The 'init' function initializes each module with an optional configuration object, then attaches schema metadata to a schema generated by 'udf_schema()'. All functions used seem standard for setting up data processing modules. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious logic. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical initialization routine for a data processing or analysis library, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It simply sets up modules and attaches schema metadata, which is standard practice.",
