  "purpose": "Initialize and configure various modules and attach schema metadata in a language processing system.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are not explicitly shown; the code imports modules and calls their init functions, which may load configuration or data internally.",
  "sinks": "The attach_schema_metadata function and the init functions could potentially process or modify data, but no explicit data sinks or outputs are visible here.",
  "flows": "The init function calls multiple module initialization functions with a config object, then attaches schema metadata, forming a flow from input config to schema attachment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, unusual code, or suspicious constructs are present. All imported modules are standard or project-specific, and no dynamic code execution is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code performs systematic initialization of various modules related to language processing, passing an optional configuration object. The modules are initialized with this config, and finally, schema metadata is attached to a schema object. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors, is apparent. The structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical initialization routine for a language processing system, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
