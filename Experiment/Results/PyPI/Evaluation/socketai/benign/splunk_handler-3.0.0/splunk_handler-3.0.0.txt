      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, non-malicious Python logging handler designed for sending logs to Splunk. It does not contain obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The security risk is minimal and primarily depends on external management of sensitive tokens. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.15, reflecting standard operational risks."
