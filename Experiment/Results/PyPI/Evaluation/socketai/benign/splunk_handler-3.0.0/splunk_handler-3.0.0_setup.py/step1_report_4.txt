  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the 'splunk_handler' Python package.",
  "sources": "The open('README.md').read() call for long_description.",
  "sinks": "The open('README.md').read() could potentially read local files, but is not inherently malicious.",
  "flows": "The long_description content flows from reading a local file into the setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() to read 'README.md' during setup; no validation or sanitization, but this is standard practice and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools for packaging a Python project. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. The only data read operation is from a local file ('README.md') for the long description, which is typical. No untrusted input, network activity, or suspicious code structures are present. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behavior detected. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be legitimate and intended for package distribution without malicious intent. No security risks or malware indications are present.",
