  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the 'splunk_handler' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package details.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long_description, static string values for package metadata, and the 'install_requires' list.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no untrusted data or user input handling is observed.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The only notable aspect is reading 'README.md' dynamically, which is standard. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools for packaging. It reads a description file and specifies package metadata and dependencies. No suspicious code, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are detectable. No code injection, data leaks, or obfuscated code are present. The dependencies and package info are typical for a Python package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup configuration script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a typical package setup file with no anomalies.",
