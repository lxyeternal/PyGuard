{
  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python project, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static strings for package info; reading 'README.md' via open() for long_description.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' to assign long_description; no data flow leading to execution or external effects.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() without exception handling; no other suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script utilizing setuptools. It reads a local README file to set the long_description, which is common practice. No malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The only minor concern is the unguarded open() call that could raise an exception if the file is missing, but this does not indicate malicious intent. The code's structure and content are straightforward and standard for packaging scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, standard, and free from malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate and justified given the code's simplicity and intent.",
