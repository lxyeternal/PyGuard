  "purpose": "Unit tests for validating and encoding/decoding a specific X.509 certificate with extension data related to clearance constraints.",
  "sources": "Reading PEM base64-encoded certificate data from a string; decoding ASN.1 data using der_decoder; accessing open type maps; reading from extensions within the certificate.",
  "sinks": "Encoding ASN.1 objects back into DER format; assertions on decoded data; iterating through extension data.",
  "flows": "PEM base64 string -> der_decoder -> ASN.1 object -> (optional) der_encoder -> assertions and data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code performs standard ASN.1 decoding/encoding and unit testing without any dynamic code execution or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard unit test module that reads a PEM-encoded certificate, decodes it using pyasn1 modules, verifies the integrity of the decoded data, and tests open type decoding. It accesses specific extension OIDs and verifies certain policies and categories. The code uses typical ASN.1 handling and testing practices with no signs of malicious behavior. No external data transmission, backdoors, or malicious side effects are present. It solely focuses on certificate parsing and validation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign unit testing script for ASN.1 certificate structures with no malicious intent. It appears to be part of a validation suite for cryptographic or certificate-related components, with no evidence of supply chain attacks or malicious behavior.",
