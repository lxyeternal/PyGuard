  "purpose": "Unit test for ASN.1 certificate parsing and validation, focusing on specific extensions and their nested data structures.",
  "sources": "Reads a static PEM-encoded certificate embedded as a string.",
  "sinks": "ASN.1 decoding, validation, and re-encoding; no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Decodes the certificate, verifies extensions, and encodes back; no untrusted data flows beyond static data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard ASN.1 parsing and validation using pyasn1 modules, with assertions to verify specific extension OIDs and nested values. It operates solely on embedded static data, with no external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The structure is straightforward, and the purpose is to validate certificate extensions. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured unit test for ASN.1 certificate extensions. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain issues. The static embedded certificate and the use of standard libraries indicate a safe, legitimate testing purpose.",
