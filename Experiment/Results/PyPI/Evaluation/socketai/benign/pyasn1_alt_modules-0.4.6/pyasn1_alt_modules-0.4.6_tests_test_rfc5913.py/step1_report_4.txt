  "purpose": "Unit tests for parsing and verifying X.509 certificates with specific extensions using pyasn1 modules.",
  "sources": "Reads certificate data from embedded PEM text, reads data via pem.readBase64fromText().",
  "sinks": "Uses der_decoder() and der_encoder() for decoding and encoding ASN.1 structures; no direct untrusted data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Certificate PEM text -> pem.readBase64fromText() -> der_decoder() -> ASN.1 objects -> assertions -> der_encoder() for verification.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behavior observed. The code mainly performs standard ASN.1 parsing, decoding, and validation. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious functions detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a unittest module that decodes a hardcoded PEM certificate, verifies its structure, and checks certain extensions and policies. It uses pyasn1 modules to parse ASN.1 data, verifying extension identifiers and nested data structures. No network activity, data exfiltration, or suspicious code execution present. No obfuscation or malicious payloads identified. The code functions solely for ASN.1 validation and testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of unit tests for certificate parsing; no malicious intent or malicious code detected. It uses standard libraries and performs straightforward ASN.1 decoding and validation tasks without any malicious side effects.",
