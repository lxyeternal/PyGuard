  "purpose": "Unit testing ASN.1 DER encoding/decoding with static PEM data to verify cryptographic policy structures.",
  "sources": "Static PEM-encoded data embedded within the test code.",
  "sinks": "Decoding and re-encoding ASN.1 data; no external system calls or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Read PEM data -> decode ASN.1 structure -> verify content -> encode ASN.1 structure -> compare with original.",
  "anomalies": "None; static test data and standard library usage, no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard ASN.1 parsing and validation within a unit test framework. It uses static, hardcoded data and no external inputs or network activity. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign ASN.1 unit test suite with no malicious or suspicious activity. The static test data and straightforward processing confirm a zero malware and obfuscation score, with negligible security risk.",
