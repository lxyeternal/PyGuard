{
  "purpose": "Unit testing for ASN.1 DER decoding and encoding of a security policy, involving parsing of PEM-encoded data and ASN.1 structures.",
  "sources": "PEM text input containing base64-encoded data, imported modules, and class methods that process this data.",
  "sinks": "ASN.1 decoder and encoder functions, which process and reconstruct data structures, but do not appear to execute untrusted code or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "The PEM data is read and decoded via der_decoder; the ASN.1 objects are processed and re-encoded. No untrusted input is passed into system calls or network functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. The code solely performs data parsing and serialization. The PEM data appears to be standard cryptographic content. No suspicious dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports cryptography and ASN.1 handling modules to parse a specific cryptographic structure from a PEM string. It performs standard decode-encode verification steps in unit tests, checking that the decoded ASN.1 object matches expected content and structure. All operations are confined to data parsing and testing, with no external system influence or malicious actions. The data processed appears to be a cryptographic policy document, consistent with typical use cases, and there is no evidence of malware or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard unit testing module focused on ASN.1 DER encoding/decoding of cryptographic policies. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident from this code.",
