{
  "purpose": "Unit testing for the pyasn1-alt-modules library, specifically testing DER encoding/decoding of security policies in ASN.1 format.",
  "sources": "Reading PEM base64 data via pem.readBase64fromText; decoding ASN.1 data with der_decoder; accessing open type mappings with opentypemap.get",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data processing; no data outputs or network connections based on untrusted inputs are observed.",
  "flows": "Input PEM data -> base64 decoding -> ASN.1 decoding -> ASN.1 object validation and re-encoding",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments. Usage of standard libraries and clear ASN.1 processing. No obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard unit tests for ASN.1 DER encoding/decoding processes related to security policies. It reads a static PEM string, decodes it, and verifies structure and content. It also tests open type mappings and the integrity of the encoded data. The code adheres to normal testing practices and does not include malicious or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign unit test script for ASN.1 data processing within the pyasn1-alt-modules library. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The script is designed solely for validation purposes and uses static, hardcoded test data.",
