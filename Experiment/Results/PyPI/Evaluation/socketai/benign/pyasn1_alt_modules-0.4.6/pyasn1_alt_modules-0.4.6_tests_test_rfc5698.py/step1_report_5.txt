{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to test the encoding and decoding of ASN.1 data structures related to security policies, specifically using DER encoding/decoding and PEM format reading.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from PEM-formatted text string via pem.readBase64fromText() and potentially external sources via standard input or file reading mechanisms, although not explicitly shown.",
  "sinks": "Uses der_decoder and der_encoder functions to process ASN.1 data, and accesses attributes within decoded objects. No direct data sinks for untrusted input are evident, as the data is from a hardcoded PEM string.",
  "flows": "PEM text is decoded into ASN.1 objects, then re-encoded to verify integrity. No untrusted data flows from external sources to sensitive operations or network sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors detected. The PEM data appears to be a standard, hardcoded ASN.1 structure for testing purposes. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden code are present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs ASN.1 encoding/decoding tests using the pyasn1 modules. It reads a predefined PEM string, decodes it into ASN.1 structures, verifies correctness via assertions, and re-encodes the data. It also tests open type decoding with a known map. The code structure is typical for unit tests and does not contain any code that would perform malicious actions, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or executing untrusted code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test suite for ASN.1 encoding/decoding with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It processes hardcoded test data and performs verification steps only. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected.",
