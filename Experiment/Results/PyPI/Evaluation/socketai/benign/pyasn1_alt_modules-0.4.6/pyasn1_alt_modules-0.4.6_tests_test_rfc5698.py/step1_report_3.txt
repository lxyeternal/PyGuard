{
  "purpose": "Unit testing for the pyasn1-alt-modules package, specifically for handling DER encoded data and ASN.1 structure validation related to security policies.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from a PEM base64-encoded string, converted into binary form using pem.readBase64fromText.",
  "sinks": "ASN.1 decoding and encoding functions, as well as assertions for data integrity. No untrusted data is written to external systems or used in insecure operations.",
  "flows": "The data is read from the PEM string, decoded into ASN.1 objects, validated via assertions, and then re-encoded to verify integrity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. Usage of standard cryptographic libraries and testing frameworks. No dynamic code execution or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs unit tests on ASN.1 data structures, decoding and encoding them, and validating their contents. It uses standard libraries and functions for cryptographic data handling. No indication of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious data flow. The PEM data appears to be a test fixture, not real secret data. No network activity, file operations, or external system interactions are present. Overall, the code is a straightforward, legitimate test suite for ASN.1 processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test suite for ASN.1 structures related to security policies, with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior. It processes static test data for validation purposes only.",
