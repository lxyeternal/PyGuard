  "purpose": "The code is a unit test for decoding and verifying a PEM-encoded EC Private Key using ASN.1 specifications.",
  "sources": "Reads PEM-encoded private key text from a string variable",
  "sinks": "Uses ASN.1 decoding/encoding functions; no untrusted data sinks observed",
  "flows": "PEM string -> der_decoder -> ASN.1 object -> der_encoder -> comparison; no external data flows or network interactions",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials beyond the test key, no obfuscated or suspicious code, no unusual behavior",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard cryptography modules and performs a straightforward ASN.1 decoding test on a known PEM-encoded key. The code's purpose is to verify correct decoding and re-encoding, with no network activity or dynamic code execution. The test uses a static, hardcoded PEM string, which is typical for unit tests. No signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or sabotage are present. The code structure and imports are normal for cryptography testing modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign unit test for ASN.1 decoding of a cryptographic key. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks.",
