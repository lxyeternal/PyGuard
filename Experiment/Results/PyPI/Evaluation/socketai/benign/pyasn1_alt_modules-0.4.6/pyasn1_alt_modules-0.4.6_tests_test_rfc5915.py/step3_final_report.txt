  "sources": "Reading PEM base64 text, ASN.1 decoder input",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data or network activity",
  "flows": "PEM base64 input -> ASN.1 decoder -> ASN.1 object -> re-encoder -> comparison with original",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded cryptographic key in test data; no obfuscation or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward ASN.1 decoding and re-encoding of a static PEM-encoded EC private key, verifying specific parameters. It uses standard cryptography libraries, with no external data flows, network activity, or obfuscation. The hardcoded key is typical for testing but could be sensitive if misused outside controlled environments. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to the embedded key, which is acceptable in test contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard cryptographic unit test with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain compromise. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are accurate and appropriate. The minor risk score reflects the presence of hardcoded test keys but does not indicate malicious activity.",
