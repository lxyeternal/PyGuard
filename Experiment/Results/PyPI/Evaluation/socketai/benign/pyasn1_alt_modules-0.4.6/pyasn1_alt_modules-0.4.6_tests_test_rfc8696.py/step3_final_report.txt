  "purpose": "Unit tests for ASN.1 cryptographic data structures, verifying encoding and decoding of static test vectors related to key transport and PSK within cryptographic protocols.",
  "sources": "Static PEM-encoded cryptographic data embedded as string literals in the test cases.",
  "sinks": "ASN.1 decoder and encoder functions processing the static data; no external data or untrusted input handling beyond test vectors.",
  "flows": "Read static PEM data -> decode ASN.1 structures -> validate content -> re-encode to verify integrity; no external or network flows involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets beyond test vectors, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of unit tests that decode predefined, static PEM-encoded cryptographic data, verify the ASN.1 structure and content, and re-encode it for consistency. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or external interactions. The test vectors are standard cryptographic test data, used solely for validation purposes. The code's purpose is to ensure correct ASN.1 encoding/decoding, with no dynamic or untrusted input processing. Given these observations, the code is benign, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the critical reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are justified and consistent with the code's function.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a safe, standard cryptographic ASN.1 validation test suite using static test vectors. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The low risk score (0.1) accounts for the cryptographic data handling but is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
