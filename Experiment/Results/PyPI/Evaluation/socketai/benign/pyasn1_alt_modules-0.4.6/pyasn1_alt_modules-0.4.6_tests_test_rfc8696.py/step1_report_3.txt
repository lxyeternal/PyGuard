  "purpose": "Unit tests for decoding and validating specific cryptographic ASN.1 structures related to pyasn1-alt-modules, specifically for content information, recipient info, and key agreement data.",
  "sources": "Reading base64-encoded PEM text for cryptographic key data, reading ASN.1 encoded data for decoding, and obtaining type mappings from 'opentypemap'.",
  "sinks": "Decoding ASN.1 data from PEM, and encoding back to DER format. No data is sent over network, stored insecurely, or executed as code.",
  "flows": "Base64 PEM data → decode to ASN.1 structure → validate contents and structure → re-encode ASN.1 to DER for verification.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials other than static PEM-encoded cryptographic key material, which is typical for test vectors. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hidden backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of unit tests that parse cryptographic ASN.1 data embedded as base64 strings, decode and validate structure, then re-encode for consistency checks. It verifies content types, recipient info types, and specific key identifiers. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. Usage of static test vectors is standard practice in cryptography testing. The structure and format are consistent with normal cryptographic test code, with no suspicious anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of unit tests for ASN.1 cryptographic data structures. No malicious intent or security risks are apparent. The code does not perform any malicious actions or insecure operations beyond standard test vector validation.",
