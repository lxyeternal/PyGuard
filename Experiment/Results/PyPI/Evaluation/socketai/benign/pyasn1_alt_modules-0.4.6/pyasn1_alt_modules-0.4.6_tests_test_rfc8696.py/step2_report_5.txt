  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their conclusions with the code and considering the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Unit tests for ASN.1 cryptographic data structures, no malicious activity, static test vectors.\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, risk: 0.1, obfuscated: 0, confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- The code only processes static PEM data, decodes ASN.1 structures, and verifies content.\n- No network, dynamic code, or external system interaction.\n- The test vectors are standard cryptographic test data.\n- No signs of malicious payloads or obfuscation.\n\n**Verdict:** The low malware and risk scores are justified. The confidence is high.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on ASN.1 parsing, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, risk: 0, obfuscated: 0, confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- Same reasoning applies: static test vectors, ASN.1 decoding, no external interactions.\n- No malicious payloads or suspicious code.\n\n**Verdict:** The assigned scores are reasonable and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** ASN.1 parsing and validation, static test vectors, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, risk: 0.1, obfuscated: 0, confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- Same as above; no signs of malicious activity.\n- The only potential concern could be the static cryptographic data, but this is typical for tests.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** ASN.1 decoding of cryptographic message structures, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, risk: 0, obfuscated: 0, confidence: 1\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- The code is straightforward, only decoding and verifying static test data.\n- No suspicious behavior or obfuscation.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** ASN.1 decoding of cryptographic messages, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, risk: 0, obfuscated: 0, confidence: 1\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- Same reasoning: static test vectors, no external effects, no malicious code.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a benign set of unit tests for ASN.1 cryptographic structures.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, risk: 0 or 0.1, obfuscated: 0) are consistent with the code's behavior.\n- The only minor point is the small risk score (0.1) in some reports, justified by the presence of static cryptographic test vectors, which could theoretically be misused if misinterpreted, but in this context, it's negligible.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation present.\n\n**Risk score:** 0.1 — very low, justified by the static test data, but overall minimal.\n\n---\n\n**My personal estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThe code is standard cryptographic unit test code, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The small risk score reflects the presence of static cryptographic data, which is typical in such tests but should always be handled carefully in production or security-sensitive environments.",
