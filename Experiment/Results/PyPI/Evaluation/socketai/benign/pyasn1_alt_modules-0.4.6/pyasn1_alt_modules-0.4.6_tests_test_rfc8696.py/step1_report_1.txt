  "purpose": "Unit tests for verifying ASN.1 encoded cryptographic data structures related to key transport and agreement with PSK in the pyasn1-alt-modules package.",
  "sources": "Readings from PEM formatted base64 data, ASN.1 decoding operations, and data loaded from external modules like pem, rfc5083, rfc5652, rfc8696, and opentypemap.",
  "sinks": "Decoding ASN.1 data, comparing data structures, encoding ASN.1 objects back to DER, and extracting specific fields such as subjectKeyIdentifier.",
  "flows": "PEM base64 data → decoding to ASN.1 objects → validation and comparison → potential re-encoding back to DER for consistency checks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code constructs, no hardcoded secrets aside from cryptographic test data, and no network or system interaction code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of unit tests for cryptographic ASN.1 data structures, validating correct encoding and decoding of key transport and key agreement data. It uses standard cryptographic ASN.1 structures and libraries, with no signs of data leaks, malicious payloads, or backdoors. The cryptographic test data appears to be static test vectors. The code only processes and verifies ASN.1 data; no external network, system commands, or credential handling is present. The structure and usage align with typical cryptographic validation routines, and there are no suspicious code flows or anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of unit tests for ASN.1 cryptography structures, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It is used for validating correct encoding/decoding, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
