  "purpose": "Unit tests for decoding and verifying PKCS#7-like cryptographic message structures using pyasn1 modules.",
  "sources": "Reading PEM-encoded base64 text strings and decoding them into ASN.1 objects.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks where untrusted data leads to system effects; primarily decoding ASN.1 data and verifying structure integrity.",
  "flows": "Input PEM data -> decode ASN.1 structure -> verify content matches expected structure.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets beyond test data; no unusual code behaviors; standard use of decoding functions.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard unit testing for cryptographic ASN.1 structures using pyasn1 and related modules. It reads PEM-encoded cryptographic data, decodes it, and verifies the structure and certain fields. No external network activity, no data exfiltration, or suspicious code actions are present. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code is consistent with test routines for cryptographic message validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of unit tests for ASN.1 decoding and structure validation of cryptographic messages. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks within this module. It is safe to use in its current context.",
