  "purpose": "Unit tests for ASN.1 encoding/decoding of cryptographic attributes using static PEM data.",
  "sources": "Static PEM text embedded in the test class.",
  "sinks": "ASN.1 decoder and encoder functions, assertions within the test methods.",
  "flows": "Read static PEM data -> decode ASN.1 structure -> verify content -> encode ASN.1 structure -> compare with original PEM data.",
  "anomalies": "None; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward ASN.1 decoding and encoding tests on static, hardcoded PEM data. It verifies the structure and content without external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The test suite uses standard libraries and functions, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns. All operations are read-only and intended for validation of ASN.1 processing, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit testing script for ASN.1 structures, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The static data and lack of external interactions confirm its safety.",
