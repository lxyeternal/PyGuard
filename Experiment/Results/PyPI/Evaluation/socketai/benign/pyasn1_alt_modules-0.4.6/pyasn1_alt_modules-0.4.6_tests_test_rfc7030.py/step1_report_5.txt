{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform unit testing on ASN.1 data encoding/decoding and parsing related to cryptographic attributes in a certificate or request.",
  "sources": "Reads base64-encoded PEM data from a string, which is then decoded into ASN.1 format.",
  "sinks": "Decodes ASN.1 data, encodes ASN.1 data back into DER format, and prints ASN.1 structures; no untrusted external inputs or outputs to sensitive data observed.",
  "flows": "PEM base64 data → decode to ASN.1 → verify contents and encode back → optional open types decoding → assertions on ASN.1 structure and content.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, no hardcoded credentials beyond test data, no network activity, and no unusual operations. The code is standard for unit tests with test data embedded.",
  "analysis": "The script imports cryptography-related libraries and performs unit tests involving ASN.1 encoding and decoding using provided PEM data. It validates that the decoding and encoding processes are consistent and verifies specific attribute types and values. The data used is embedded test data, not sourced from external or untrusted inputs during runtime. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities. The code structure is standard, with no obfuscated or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign unit testing script for ASN.1 data processing related to cryptographic attributes. It contains no malicious intent or security risks, merely verifying correct encoding and decoding functionality. No indicators of malicious behavior or supply chain attack are present.",
