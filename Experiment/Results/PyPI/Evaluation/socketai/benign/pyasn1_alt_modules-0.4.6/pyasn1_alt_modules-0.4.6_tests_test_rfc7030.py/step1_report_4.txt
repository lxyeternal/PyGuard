{
  "purpose": "The code is a unit testing module for validating ASN.1 encoded data related to CSR attributes using the pyasn1 and pyasn1_alt_modules libraries.",
  "sources": "Reads PEM-formatted base64 data from the 'pem_text' string; decodes data using der_decoder; reads ASN.1 specifications from imported modules.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes data to external systems or performs actions based on untrusted input that could cause harm; mainly processes and validates ASN.1 data.",
  "flows": "Reads base64 PEM data -> decodes to ASN.1 object -> validates object content against expected values; also decodes with open types map.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. Uses standard libraries for cryptographic data processing; no obfuscated code or unsafe operations.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward unit test setup that loads a PEM-encoded ASN.1 structure, decodes it, and verifies its contents against expected values. It employs safe and standard cryptographic processing functions, with no network activity, file manipulation, or dynamic code execution. Import statements and data processing are typical for ASN.1 handling, and the code does not include any hidden or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign testing module for ASN.1 data validation, with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It performs standard decoding and validation routines without any suspicious or harmful operations.",
