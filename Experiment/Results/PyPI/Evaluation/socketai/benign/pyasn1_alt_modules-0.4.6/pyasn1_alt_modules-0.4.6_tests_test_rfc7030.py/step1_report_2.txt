  "purpose": "Unit tests for ASN.1 DER encoding/decoding of cryptographic attributes in the pyasn1-alt-modules library.",
  "sources": "Reads hardcoded PEM base64-encoded data, imports modules, and reads ASN.1 specifications.",
  "sinks": "No data sink operations; no output or network interaction observed.",
  "flows": "Reads static PEM data -> decodes ASN.1 structure -> re-encodes and compares data; processes ASN.1 objects.",
  "anomalies": "Uses hardcoded PEM data; no dynamic or untrusted input handling; no suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of unittests verifying the ASN.1 encoding/decoding processes. It imports cryptography modules and reads static, hardcoded base64-encoded data from a string. The tests perform ASN.1 decoding, encoding, and value verification, including open type processing. There are no network operations, no file operations, no execution of untrusted input, nor any indication of malicious intent. The use of static data and standard library functions suggests this is a testing module with no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign testing suite for ASN.1 structures within the pyasn1-alt-modules library. No signs of malware, malicious code, or security risks are present.",
