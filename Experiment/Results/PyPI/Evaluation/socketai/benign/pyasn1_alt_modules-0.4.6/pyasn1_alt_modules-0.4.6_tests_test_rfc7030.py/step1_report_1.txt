  "purpose": "Unit tests for parsing and encoding ASN.1 structures related to cryptographic attributes using the pyasn1 library.",
  "sources": "pem.readBase64fromText() reading the PEM-encoded data, and the pyasn1_der.decoder.read method reading DER-encoded data.",
  "sinks": "der_decoder and der_encoder for decoding and encoding ASN.1 data; unittest assertions to verify correctness.",
  "flows": "Input PEM data -> decode with der_decoder -> process ASN.1 objects -> encode back with der_encoder -> compare with original data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no dynamic code execution, no unusual or obfuscated code; standard use of ASN.1 processing functions.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a unittest class for validating ASN.1 encoding/decoding using the pyasn1 library. It reads a PEM-encoded string, decodes it, and verifies the structure and values. It also tests open type handling with a map. All functions are standard for ASN.1 processing, and there are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, file access, or hidden code. The code appears solely for testing purposes, with no indications of backdoors or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of unit tests for ASN.1 data processing, containing no malicious or suspicious behavior. It is a standard testing script with no signs of malware or security risks.",
