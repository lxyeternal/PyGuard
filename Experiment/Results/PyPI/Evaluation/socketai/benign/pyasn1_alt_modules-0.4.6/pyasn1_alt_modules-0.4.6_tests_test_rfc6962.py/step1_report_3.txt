{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to parse, decode, and verify specific X.509 certificates with particular extensions, primarily for testing and validation purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads PEM-encoded certificate data via hardcoded string variables; reads data through pem.readBase64fromText function.",
  "sinks": "Uses der_decoder and der_encoder to process ASN.1 data; no direct sinks for untrusted input or data leakage identified.",
  "flows": "Certificate PEM data -> base64 decoding -> DER decoding -> ASN.1 structure parsing -> extension validation; no malicious flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior identified. Use of cryptography and ASN.1 processing libraries is standard for certificate validation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports cryptography libraries for ASN.1 parsing and certificate validation. It contains two unit test cases that load hardcoded PEM-encoded certificates, decode them, and verify specific certificate extensions. The code structure is straightforward, with no suspicious or malicious operations such as network communication, data exfiltration, or malicious code insertion. The code's purpose appears to be testing or validation of certificates with particular extensions, with no evident malicious intent or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard certificate validation testing script with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It processes known PEM certificates and verifies specific extensions without executing any suspicious or harmful actions.",
