{
  "purpose": "The code performs ASN.1 certificate parsing and validation, specifically checking for certain extensions (criticalPoison and embeddedSCT) within static PEM-encoded certificates, using pyasn1 and custom modules.",
  "sources": "Reads static PEM text embedded in the code, decodes base64, then ASN.1 decodes the certificate and its extensions.",
  "sinks": "No external data sources or sinks; operations are limited to in-memory decoding, validation, and re-encoding of ASN.1 structures.",
  "flows": "PEM text -> base64 decoding -> ASN.1 decoding -> extension validation -> optional re-encoding.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets are test data, no dynamic inputs, no network activity, no system modifications, no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of unit tests verifying ASN.1 certificate structures with specific extensions. It uses static, embedded PEM data, decodes it, and checks for the presence of certain extension OIDs. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external influence. The code's purpose is to validate cryptographic certificate structures, not to perform any malicious actions. The minimal security risk stems from handling cryptographic data, but no vulnerabilities or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard cryptographic validation test suite for ASN.1 certificates. It contains no malware, no obfuscation, and poses no security threat. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.05-0.1), justified by the cryptographic context but with no active vulnerabilities.",
