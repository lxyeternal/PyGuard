  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard cryptographic validation test suite for ASN.1 certificates. It contains no malware, no obfuscation, and poses no security threat. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.05-0.1), justified by the cryptographic context but with no active vulnerabilities."
