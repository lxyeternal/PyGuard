  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its logic, and the context.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a unit test that processes a hardcoded PEM-encoded certificate.\n- It uses standard ASN.1 decoding/encoding libraries (`pyasn1`) and does not involve external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- The certificate data is static and embedded within the source code.\n- The test verifies decoding correctness and specific extension values, particularly for a custom extension (`id_pe_nftype`).\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious logic are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors are detected.\n- The code appears to be a standard, well-structured test suite for certificate parsing.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Findings:\n\n- **Issues in the code:** None detected.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None. The code is purely for testing ASN.1 decoding.\n- **External data/input:** None; all data is hardcoded.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None, as no untrusted input is processed, and no dynamic code execution occurs.\n- **Use of cryptographic libraries:** Standard and well-known.\n- **Security risks:** Minimal; the code is a benign test.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Correctly states that the code is a safe ASN.1 certificate parsing test.\n- No anomalies or suspicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct).\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Also accurately describes the code as a straightforward test.\n- No suspicious behavior or malicious intent.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 is slightly above zero but justified as very low risk; still acceptable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Correctly identifies the code as a standard ASN.1 parsing test.\n- No anomalies or malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same conclusion; benign ASN.1 test code.\n- No malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same findings; standard certificate parsing test.\n- No suspicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation of scores:\n\n- All reports correctly assign malware scores of 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n- The risk scores are appropriately low; some reports assign 0, others 0.1, which is acceptable given the static, non-executable nature of the code.\n- The code does not perform any actions that could compromise security or indicate a supply chain attack.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected).\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present).\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk).\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code is a benign test.\n- The embedded certificate is static; no dynamic or external data handling.\n- The code uses standard libraries and practices for ASN.1 certificate parsing.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary:**\n\n**The code is a safe, standard ASN.1 certificate parsing unit test with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.**\n\n**Proposed final scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese scores reflect the benign nature of the code and its context.",
