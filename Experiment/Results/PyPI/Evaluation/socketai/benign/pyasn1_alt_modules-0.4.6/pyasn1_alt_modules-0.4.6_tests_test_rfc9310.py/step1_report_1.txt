{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform unit testing on an ASN.1 encoded X.509 certificate, verifying proper decoding and extension handling.",
  "sources": "Input is read from the PEM-encoded certificate string embedded in the source code, which is decoded from Base64, then ASN.1 DER encoded data.",
  "sinks": "Decoding functions (`der_decoder`), ASN.1 object processing, and comparisons may handle untrusted ASN.1 data, but the input source is hardcoded; no data from external untrusted sources is used.",
  "flows": "Base64-decoded certificate data flows into ASN.1 decoding functions; extension data is further decoded and checked against expected values; no external or untrusted data flows from input to output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward ASN.1 decoding and unit testing logic with embedded certificate data. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports cryptographic ASN.1 processing modules, contains a hardcoded PEM certificate for testing, and verifies decoding correctness and specific extension values. The test ensures that the certificate can be correctly parsed and that certain extensions contain expected values. No dynamic data input, external network activity, or suspicious behavior present. The code is standard test code for certificate parsing with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard unit test for ASN.1 certificate processing. It does not perform any malicious actions, contain backdoors, or handle untrusted external data beyond embedded test data. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified.",
