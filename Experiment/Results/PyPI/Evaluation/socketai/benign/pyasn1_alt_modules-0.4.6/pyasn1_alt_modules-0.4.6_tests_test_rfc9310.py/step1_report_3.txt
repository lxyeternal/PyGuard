{
  "purpose": "The code is a unit test for verifying the decoding and encoding of a PEM-encoded X.509 certificate using ASN.1 DER encoding/decoding libraries.",
  "sources": "Reads a PEM-formatted certificate from a hardcoded string; uses imported modules to process ASN.1 data",
  "sinks": "Uses der_decoder and der_encoder functions on the certificate data; potential sink for untrusted ASN.1 data if used with external inputs (but here, data is hardcoded)",
  "flows": "Reads hardcoded certificate data -> decodes ASN.1 structure -> processes extensions -> re-encodes and verifies data integrity",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no dynamic execution or obfuscated code; use of well-known libraries for ASN.1 processing; no network connections or suspicious code flows",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard unit test verifying ASN.1 encoding/decoding for a specific X.509 certificate. The certificate data is hardcoded in base64 PEM format. It uses pyasn1 libraries for ASN.1 operations, which are standard and not suspicious. The test decodes the certificate, verifies the decoded data matches the original, and checks for specific extensions. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors. No external inputs, network activity, or secret handling is present. The code’s structure is typical for a test suite and contains no obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign unit test verifying ASN.1 encoding/decoding of a static certificate. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or security issues. It is a standard test script using open-source libraries with no indication of supply chain attack vectors.",
