{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to test the decoding and encoding of a PEM-encoded X.509 certificate and its extensions using pyasn1 modules.",
  "sources": "Reads the PEM-encoded certificate from the string 'cert_pem_text'.",
  "sinks": "Uses pyasn1's der_decoder and der_encoder functions to process ASN.1 data, but no untrusted input is directly written to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "PEM string -> der_decoder -> ASN.1 object -> (possible re-encoding with der_encoder) -> extension value processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual or suspicious code constructs. The code performs standard ASN.1 decoding and testing without dynamic code execution, network communication, or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script is a unit test for ASN.1 certificate parsing, focusing on decoding a static PEM string and verifying its extensions. It imports standard modules and uses well-documented library functions without suspicious or malicious logic. No data leakage, network communication, or backdoors are evident. The code's structure is straightforward and aligns with standard testing practices. There are no anomalies such as obfuscated code or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite intended for validating ASN.1 certificate parsing. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks. The overall security risk is minimal.",
