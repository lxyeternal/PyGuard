  "purpose": "Unit testing for ASN.1 encoding/decoding of S/MIME capabilities using pyasn1 modules.",
  "sources": "Reading PEM-encoded data via pem.readBase64fromText; decoding ASN.1 data using der_decoder; inspecting data structures.",
  "sinks": "Encoding ASN.1 objects with der_encoder; no evident data sinks for untrusted input beyond decoding and re-encoding.",
  "flows": "pem.readBase64fromText -> der_decoder -> processing ASN.1 structures -> der_encoder.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; code appears to process static test data; no external network activity or command execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a unit test module designed for verifying ASN.1 DER encoding/decoding of S/MIME capabilities. It imports well-known libraries, including pyasn1 and pyasn1_alt_modules, to handle cryptographic data structures. The code reads static PEM data, decodes it, and re-encodes it, performing assertions on the structure and content. No user input, environment variable misuse, or dynamic data handling is present. There are no suspicious functions, external network calls, or code injection vectors. The code's purpose is purely for testing and validation of cryptographic data structures, with no malicious behavior evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward unit test suite for ASN.1 cryptographic data structures, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It processes static test data for validation purposes only. Therefore, it poses no security threat.",
