  "purpose": "Unit testing for SMIMECapabilities ASN.1 parsing and encoding, verifying correct decoding/encoding of specific cryptographic capabilities.",
  "sources": "Reading Base64 PEM data, decoding DER data, reading ASN.1 structures, and parsing parameters.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; data is processed, encoded, and decoded within test context. No output to external systems or network communication.",
  "flows": "PEM base64 data read -> DER decoding -> ASN.1 parsing -> parameter decoding -> re-encoding for verification.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity, no backdoors. Use of standard cryptographic libraries and testing framework.",
  "analysis": "The code imports cryptographic and ASN.1 modules and defines unittests to parse and verify cryptographic capabilities data. It reads PEM-encoded data, decodes it, and re-encodes to verify correctness. The tests include verifying specific cryptographic capability identifiers and parameters, with no external network or system modifications. The code appears to be a standard test suite for ASN.1 parsing and encoding. No malicious patterns, suspicious code, or anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test suite for cryptographic ASN.1 data parsing and encoding, with no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It operates entirely within a controlled test environment, verifying cryptographic capabilities.",
