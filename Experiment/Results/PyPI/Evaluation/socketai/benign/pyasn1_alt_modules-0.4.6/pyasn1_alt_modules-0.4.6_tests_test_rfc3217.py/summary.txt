  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured unit test suite for ASN.1 cryptographic structures. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The static test data and processing are typical for such tests. The security risk and malware scores are appropriately zero, and the confidence in this assessment is high."
