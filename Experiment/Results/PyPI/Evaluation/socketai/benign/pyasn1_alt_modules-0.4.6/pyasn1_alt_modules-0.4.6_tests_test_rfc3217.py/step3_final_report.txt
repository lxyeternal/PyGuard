  "purpose": "Unit tests for ASN.1 DER encoding/decoding of S/MIME capabilities using static PEM data.",
  "sources": "Static PEM text, ASN.1 decoding functions, capability identifiers.",
  "sinks": "ASN.1 data structures, no external data or untrusted input processed.",
  "flows": "Read static PEM -> decode ASN.1 -> verify structure -> re-encode ASN.1.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; static test data, no external network activity, no secrets, no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unit testing suite that processes static, hardcoded PEM data to verify ASN.1 encoding and decoding of S/MIME capabilities. It performs ASN.1 decoding, assertions on structure and specific capability IDs, and re-encodes the data to verify integrity. There are no external inputs, network calls, or suspicious code patterns. The purpose is purely to validate cryptographic data structures. No malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation are present. The code relies on standard cryptographic libraries and testing frameworks, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured unit test suite for ASN.1 cryptographic structures. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The static test data and processing are typical for such tests. The security risk and malware scores are appropriately zero, and the confidence in this assessment is high.",
