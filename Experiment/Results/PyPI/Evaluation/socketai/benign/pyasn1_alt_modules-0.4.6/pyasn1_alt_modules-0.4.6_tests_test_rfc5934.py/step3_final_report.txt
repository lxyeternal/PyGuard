  "purpose": "Unit tests for ASN.1 DER decoding and encoding of cryptographic messages, specifically TAMP responses and updates, using static embedded PEM data.",
  "sources": "Reads PEM base64-encoded test vectors embedded as static strings.",
  "sinks": "Decodes PEM to ASN.1 objects, then re-encodes for validation; no external data flows or untrusted inputs.",
  "flows": "PEM string -> DER decoder -> ASN.1 object -> validation and re-encoding -> comparison with original.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors; static test vectors are standard for testing.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard ASN.1 decoding and encoding tests on embedded cryptographic test vectors. It uses well-established libraries and performs validation steps without external data or network activity. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The static nature of the test data and the straightforward processing confirm benign intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate and justified based on the code's purpose and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign ASN.1 test suite with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scoring accurately reflects its safety profile.",
