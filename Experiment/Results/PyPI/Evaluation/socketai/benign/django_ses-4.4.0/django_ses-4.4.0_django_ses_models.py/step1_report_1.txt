{
  "purpose": "Define Django models for storing SES statistics and blacklisted emails.",
  "sources": "Data is read from database fields such as date, delivery_attempts, bounces, complaints, rejects, and email.",
  "sinks": "Database write operations for model instances; no untrusted data sinks like network or file system interactions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external input (via database or form submissions) into model instances, then to database storage.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns; models are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two Django models: SESStat and BlacklistedEmail. Fields are typical for database records and include validations such as unique constraints and field types. No external data sources or sinks are directly involved, nor is there any dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic. The __str__ methods format data for display but do not process untrusted input in a way that would introduce security issues. Overall, the code appears to be standard Django ORM model definitions without malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of Django models for storing email statistics and blacklisted emails. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities. It appears to be a safe, straightforward data schema.",
