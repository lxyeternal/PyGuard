{
  "purpose": "Define Django models for storing SES statistics and blacklisted emails in a database.",
  "sources": "Data is read from database fields such as date and email. No external input sources are directly read in this code.",
  "sinks": "Database save and retrieval operations are implied, but no explicit data sinks are present in the code.",
  "flows": "Data flow involves creation and retrieval of model instances, but no external data flow or untrusted input processing is evident.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The code strictly defines data models with standard Django fields and methods.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two Django ORM models, SESStat and BlacklistedEmail, with typical fields and __str__ methods. No external input handling, no dynamic code execution, no security-sensitive operations, and no suspicious patterns are present. The code appears to be standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of Django models for storing email sending statistics and blacklisted emails. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are detected. It appears to be a benign, well-structured data model definition.",
