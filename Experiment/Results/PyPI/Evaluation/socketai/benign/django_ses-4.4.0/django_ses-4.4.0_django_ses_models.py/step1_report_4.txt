  "purpose": "Define Django models for storing SES email statistics and blacklisted emails",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or untrusted data sources directly",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write to external systems or perform sensitive operations",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; models are purely declarative with no runtime data handling shown",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns; use of standard Django model fields",
  "analysis": "The code defines two Django models: SESStat for storing email statistics with a date and counts, and BlacklistedEmail for storing email addresses. Both models include basic field validation and string representations. There are no data inputs, external network calls, or code execution mechanisms present. The models are standard Django ORM constructs, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward implementation of Django models for email statistics and blacklisted emails. It contains no malicious code, no external data handling, and no security risks. It is safe and serves its intended purpose without introducing security concerns.",
