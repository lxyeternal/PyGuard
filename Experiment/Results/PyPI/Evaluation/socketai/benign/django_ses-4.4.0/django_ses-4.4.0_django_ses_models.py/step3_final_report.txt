  "purpose": "Define Django models for storing email sending statistics and blacklisted emails.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; data is stored via Django ORM fields.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; models only store data without external interactions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user input (via Django forms or admin) into models, but no risky flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard Django model definitions and no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two models with standard fields and constraints, no external data handling, dynamic code execution, or network activity. The __str__ methods are simple and safe. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic are present. The code is clear, well-structured, and adheres to best practices. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, with confidence 1. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions justify these scores. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard Django model implementation for email statistics and blacklisted emails. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and should remain unchanged.",
