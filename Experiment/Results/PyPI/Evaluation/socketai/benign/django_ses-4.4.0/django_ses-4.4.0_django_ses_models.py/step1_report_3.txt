  "purpose": "Define Django models for storing SES statistics and blacklisted emails in a database.",
  "sources": "No input data sources; models are statically defined with no external data reading.",
  "sinks": "Database interactions through Django ORM; no direct sinks for untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "Models are used for data storage; no data flow from untrusted sources is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two Django models: SESStat and BlacklistedEmail. SESStat stores email sending statistics with fields for date, delivery attempts, bounces, complaints, and rejects, with appropriate indexing and ordering. BlacklistedEmail stores unique email addresses. The code includes standard model methods for string representations. There are no indications of malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors. No external input handling or potentially dangerous code is present. The structure and content are straightforward and align with typical Django models.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django models implementation for email statistics and blacklisted emails, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
