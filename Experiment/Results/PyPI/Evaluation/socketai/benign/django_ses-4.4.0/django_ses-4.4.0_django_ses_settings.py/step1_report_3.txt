  "purpose": "Configuration and setup for Amazon SES email service integration within a Django project, including credentials, regions, DKIM, and other settings.",
  "sources": "Settings module attributes accessed via getattr, which may contain user-defined or externally provided data such as credentials, regions, and domain info.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, but potential risks involve exposed credentials if settings are improperly secured or logged.",
  "flows": "Settings attributes are retrieved at runtime; no direct flow of untrusted data into sensitive operations is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets are directly present; credentials are fetched from settings, which is typical. No suspicious or malicious code behaviors, such as code execution or network connections, are detected. No obfuscated or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward configuration setup for AWS SES integration in Django, retrieving various credentials and settings via getattr(). No direct code injection, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are evident. Credentials are stored in settings, which should be secured properly. The code correctly defaults some values, avoids hardcoding sensitive data, and does not perform any network calls or execute untrusted input. No anomalies or backdoors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign configuration file for integrating AWS SES with a Django application. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware, and there are no security risks evident beyond the importance of securing the settings configuration. Overall, it is a typical setup code with no suspicious activity.",
