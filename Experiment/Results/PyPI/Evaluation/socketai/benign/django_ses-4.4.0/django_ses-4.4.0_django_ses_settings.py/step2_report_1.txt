  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, potential vulnerabilities, and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as configuring AWS SES, DKIM, and related settings in Django, primarily via `getattr(settings, ...)`.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data flow or network activity; sensitive data (keys, secrets) are stored in settings.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, no malicious behavior. The code is straightforward, just loading configuration.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk identified. The confidence is high (0.9).\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- Malware: 0 (no malicious code)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (clear code)  \n- Risk: 0.3 seems slightly high; the code itself is benign, but handling secrets always warrants caution. Still, given the potential for secrets exposure if settings are mishandled, a low to moderate risk score is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on sensitive data like `ACCESS_KEY`, `SECRET_KEY`, and `DKIM_PRIVATE_KEY`.\n- No suspicious logic or obfuscation.\n- The analysis correctly states this is a standard configuration loader.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2 is appropriate, as the code's only concern is secure storage of secrets outside this code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Same pattern: configuration loading with no malicious behavior.\n- No anomalies or suspicious code.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2 fits, considering the handling of secrets.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Similar findings: straightforward configuration loading.\n- Sensitive data stored in settings; no malicious activity.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Same conclusion: configuration setup with no signs of malicious activity.\n- Sensitive data stored in settings, requiring secure management.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2 is suitable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior (0).\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, as code is straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation, mostly 0.2-0.3, reflecting the potential risk if secrets are mishandled outside this code.\n\n### My final estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (standard configuration, but sensitive data handling requires secure storage outside this code)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a typical configuration module for AWS SES and DKIM in Django. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The main security concern is the proper management of secrets outside this codebase, which is outside the scope of this snippet.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendations:**  \n- Ensure secrets stored in Django settings are securely managed (e.g., environment variables, secret managers).  \n- No code changes needed based on this review.",
