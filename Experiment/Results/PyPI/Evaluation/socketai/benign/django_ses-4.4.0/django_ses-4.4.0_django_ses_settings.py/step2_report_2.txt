  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issue Presence:** The code is straightforward configuration loading; no malicious behavior or anomalies are present.  \n- **Errors/Flaws:** None identified.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, security risk is 0.3, which seems slightly high given the benign nature. However, since sensitive credentials are involved, a small risk score is justified.  \n- **Justification for risk score > 0.5:** Not applicable; the score is 0.3, which is reasonable.  \n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0, no malicious activity.  \n- **Assumptions:** No unwarranted assumptions; the report correctly states the code is benign.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issue Presence:** Same as above, no malicious behavior or anomalies.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; security risk is 0.2, which aligns with the benign nature.  \n- **Comments:** The code handles sensitive data but does not perform any suspicious actions.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issue Presence:** Same observations—configuration loading, no malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; security risk 0.2, consistent with the analysis.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issue Presence:** No malicious behavior; sensitive data stored in settings, which is typical.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; security risk 0.2, reasonable.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issue Presence:** Same as above; no malicious activity detected.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; security risk 0.2.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, consistent with straightforward configuration code.  \n- **Risk score:** Slight variation, mostly around 0.2–0.3, which is appropriate given the handling of sensitive credentials but no malicious behavior.\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected or implied).  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation or suspicious code).  \n- **Risk score:** **0.2** (standard configuration with sensitive data, but no evident security flaw or malicious intent).  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a typical configuration module for AWS SES and DKIM within Django, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal but warrants proper management of secrets outside the code.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2  \n\nThis comprehensive review confirms the code is benign and properly assessed across all reports.",
