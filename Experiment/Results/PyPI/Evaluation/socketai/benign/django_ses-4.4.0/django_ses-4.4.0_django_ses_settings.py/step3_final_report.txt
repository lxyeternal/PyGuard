  "purpose": "Configuration loader for AWS SES, DKIM, and related email settings in a Django project.",
  "sources": "Retrieving configuration values from Django's settings object via getattr.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; sensitive data (keys, secrets) are stored in settings, not processed or transmitted here.",
  "flows": "Data flows from Django settings into module variables; no external data flow or network activity occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward configuration code with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code loads various AWS SES and DKIM configuration parameters from Django settings, including credentials, regions, and other options. It does not perform any network operations, data processing, or code execution. Sensitive data such as access keys and private keys are retrieved from settings, which should be securely managed outside this code. The code is clear, readable, and free of obfuscation or malicious logic. The risk primarily hinges on external secret management, not on the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration module for AWS SES and DKIM in Django, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal and mainly concerns proper secret management outside this code. All reports correctly identify no malware, no obfuscation, and low to moderate risk scores appropriate for configuration code.",
