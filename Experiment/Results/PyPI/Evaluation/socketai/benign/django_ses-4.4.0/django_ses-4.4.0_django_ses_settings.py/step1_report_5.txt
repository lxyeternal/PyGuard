{
  "purpose": "This code loads and assigns various AWS SES and DKIM configuration settings from Django settings module, mainly for email sending and processing.",
  "sources": "Configuration values retrieved using getattr from the Django settings module, including environment-specific keys, regions, DKIM keys, and ARNs.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive configuration values such as AWS keys, DKIM private keys, ARNs, and email addresses.",
  "flows": "Configuration values flow from Django settings to module variables; no user input or external data processing present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or dynamic execution observed. Sensitive data (keys, secrets) are stored in settings but not directly visible in code.",
  "analysis": "The code reads configuration parameters for AWS SES and DKIM from Django settings, assigning defaults where necessary. It manages sensitive data like AWS credentials and DKIM private keys through configuration. No hardcoded secrets are present; secrets are expected to be supplied via settings. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code is straightforward configuration loading with no indication of malicious intent or security flaws. It handles sensitive data carefully by fetching from settings, which should be securely managed outside the code. No external communication, code injection, or suspicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard configuration module for managing AWS SES and DKIM settings in a Django project. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks within its scope. Proper security depends on secure management of the Django settings, especially secrets.",
