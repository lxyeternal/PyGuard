  "purpose": "Configuration settings for a Django web application, including database, middleware, templates, installed apps, email backend, and logging.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (AWS keys), potentially from local_settings import, and static path definitions.",
  "sinks": "Sensitive information like SECRET_KEY, AWS credentials, and email backend configurations.",
  "flows": "Initialization of configuration variables, optional import of local settings which may override defaults.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hard-coded SECRET_KEY; empty AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY suggest incomplete configuration; usage of 'try-except' for local_settings import is typical but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django settings module with configuration parameters for database, middleware, templates, installed apps, email, and logging. The SECRET_KEY is hardcoded, which is insecure for production but common in development environments. The AWS credentials are empty strings, indicating either placeholders or incomplete setup, reducing risk. No malicious code or backdoors are present. The optional local_settings import allows local overrides, which is typical for separating sensitive info. Overall, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks beyond typical insecure development practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django settings file with no malicious intent. The presence of hardcoded SECRET_KEY and empty AWS credentials indicates development or incomplete configuration rather than malicious behavior. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious activities detected.",
