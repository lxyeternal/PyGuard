  "purpose": "Configuration setup for a Django web application, including database, middleware, templates, installed apps, email, and logging settings.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (AWS keys), imports local_settings, file paths for templates and database name.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data exposure in SECRET_KEY, AWS credentials, and database file path.",
  "flows": "Environment variables or imported local_settings influence AWS keys; SECRET_KEY and database path are hardcoded; local_settings may override configurations.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded SECRET_KEY and empty AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY. Use of a plaintext secret key is a security concern. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Django settings file. It contains hardcoded secrets like SECRET_KEY, which should be kept secret, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent. The AWS credentials are empty strings, which suggests misconfiguration or incomplete setup but not malicious behavior. The import of local_settings allows overrides, which is standard practice. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious data flows are present. Logging and middleware configurations are standard and do not involve untrusted input processing.",
  "conclusion": "This appears to be a standard Django configuration file with some insecure practices such as hardcoded SECRET_KEY and empty AWS credentials. There is no evidence of malicious code or supply chain attacks within this file. It does not contain malware or obfuscated code. The security risk is low but the insecure secrets should be properly managed.",
