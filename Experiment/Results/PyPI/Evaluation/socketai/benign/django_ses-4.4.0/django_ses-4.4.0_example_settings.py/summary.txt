  "conclusion": "The supply chain appears benign with no evidence of malicious code or obfuscation. The main security concern is the insecure configuration suitable for development, not malicious activity. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.3 due to insecure secrets and debug mode. Proper secret management and environment-specific configurations are recommended before deploying to production."
