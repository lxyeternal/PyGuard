  "purpose": "Configuration settings for a Django application, including database, middleware, templates, installed apps, email backend, and logging.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for AWS credentials (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY), local_settings import for additional configs.",
  "sinks": "Potential exposure of AWS credentials, logging handlers that could leak sensitive info if misconfigured.",
  "flows": "Credentials (from environment variables or local_settings) flow into email backend setup, logging configurations may expose sensitive info if misused.",
  "anomalies": "AWS credentials are left blank, possibly to be set externally; SECRET_KEY is hardcoded, which is insecure; DEBUG is set to True, which could expose debug info; no other obvious anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django configuration script with no obfuscated code or suspicious logic. The hardcoded SECRET_KEY and DEBUG=True are security concerns but not malicious. AWS credentials are empty strings, indicating credentials are expected to be supplied externally. The logging setup appears typical, with handlers for email and console output. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious behavior is detected. No suspicious network activity or malicious code is present.",
  "conclusion": "This configuration appears benign and standard for development purposes. There is no evidence of malicious intent or malware. Security concerns include hardcoded SECRET_KEY and DEBUG=True, which should be addressed before production deployment.",
