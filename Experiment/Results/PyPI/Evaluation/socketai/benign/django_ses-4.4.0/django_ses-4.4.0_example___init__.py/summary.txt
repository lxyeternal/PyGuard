  "security_risk": 0.85,
  "obfuscated": 0.7,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "conclusion": "The analysis confirms that the benign reports are correctly scored with low malware and obfuscation levels, given the lack of code evidence. The malicious report's high scores are justified by the described obfuscation and network behaviors. The overall scoring system is consistent and appropriate, warranting no changes. Continuous monitoring and further code review are recommended for suspicious samples."
