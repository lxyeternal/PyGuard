  "sources": "Input data may be read from environment variables, files, or network sources if present; however, the provided code does not show explicit data input sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file writes, or subprocess executions if present, but the code provided does not explicitly contain such operations.",
  "flows": "There are no clear source-to-sink data flows observable within the provided code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs are evident. The code contains standard Python constructs and third-party library usages that are not suspicious by themselves.",
  "analysis": "The code was examined for any malicious patterns, suspicious behaviors, or anomalies. It uses standard Python syntax, and no signs of obfuscation, malicious imports, or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, network connections to suspicious domains, or backdoors were found. There are no indications of unsafe code practices or hidden malicious logic. The code appears to be a straightforward, benign Python module with no external malicious signals.",
