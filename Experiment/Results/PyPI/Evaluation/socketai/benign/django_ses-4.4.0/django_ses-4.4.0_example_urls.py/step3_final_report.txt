  "purpose": "Configure URL routing for a Django application, including admin, documentation, email, SES webhook, and static files.",
  "sources": "The URL patterns and view references within the urlpatterns list.",
  "sinks": "The view functions and class-based views that handle incoming HTTP requests.",
  "flows": "URL patterns map incoming request paths to view callables; anomalies like the empty string and string view references could cause misrouting or runtime errors.",
  "anomalies": "An empty string '' as a URL pattern (invalid in Django), and a string reference 'django_ses.views.handle_bounce' instead of a callable view.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django URL configuration with minor misconfigurations. The empty string pattern is invalid and likely a typo; the string view reference is deprecated and should be replaced with a direct callable. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows are present. The anomalies are typical coding errors, not security issues. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is approximately 0.2 due to misconfigurations, which are easily fixable and do not pose security threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is generally safe, with minor misconfigurations that should be corrected. There is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk score is appropriate, and the malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0.",
