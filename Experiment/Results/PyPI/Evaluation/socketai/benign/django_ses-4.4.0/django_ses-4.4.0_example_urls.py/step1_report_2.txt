  "purpose": "Define URL routing for a Django web application, including admin, email handling, and webhook endpoints.",
  "sources": "User requests to specific URL paths triggering views; import statements importing views and URL patterns.",
  "sinks": "URL pattern matching routes to views, including potentially sensitive views such as email handling and webhook processing.",
  "flows": "URL paths are mapped to view functions or classes, which process incoming HTTP requests; no untrusted data sources or external data flows evident.",
  "anomalies": "Potential issue with deprecated string-based view reference in path('bounce/', 'django_ses.views.handle_bounce', ...); use of string view reference is discouraged but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up URL routing for Django with standard practices. The inclusion of 'django_ses' views indicates email handling features. The deprecated view reference using a string ('django_ses.views.handle_bounce') could lead to issues but not malicious. No suspicious or malicious code, external data leaks, or backdoors detected. The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain obfuscated code. The overall security posture appears standard, with no immediate vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard URL configuration for a Django project with email and webhook functionalities. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks detected. The only minor concern is the deprecated string view reference, which should be updated but does not introduce security issues.",
