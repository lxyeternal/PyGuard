  "purpose": "The code handles rendering a form and sending emails based on user input via a web interface.",
  "sources": "Reads user input from request.POST: 'subject', 'message', 'from', 'to', and 'html-message'.",
  "sinks": "EmailMessage.send() method which dispatches email; potential for misuse if inputs are malicious.",
  "flows": "User submits form -> server reads inputs -> constructs EmailMessage -> sends email.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, no obfuscated code, no malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code accepts user input for email parameters and sends an email accordingly. No input validation beyond presence checks is performed, but this does not inherently indicate malicious intent. It uses Django's EmailMessage class to send emails, which is standard. No external data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The inputs are directly used in the email composition without sanitization, which could be a concern for spam or injection if abused, but not malicious by itself. Overall, the code functions as a typical email-sending endpoint with no signs of malicious or sabotage intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward email form handler with no indicators of malicious behavior or malware. It does not include any suspicious or harmful operations beyond normal email handling. Risks are limited to potential misuse for spam, but no malicious activity is detected.",
