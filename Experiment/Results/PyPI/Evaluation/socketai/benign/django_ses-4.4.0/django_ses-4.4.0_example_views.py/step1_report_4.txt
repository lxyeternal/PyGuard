  "purpose": "Handle web requests to render pages and send emails based on user input",
  "sources": "request.POST data for 'subject', 'message', 'from', 'to', and 'html-message'",
  "sinks": "EmailMessage.send() method, which sends an email using provided data",
  "flows": "Data from POST request flows from request.POST to EmailMessage object, then to email.send() to dispatch email",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious code behaviors; no external network connections outside email sending; no obfuscated code or hidden actions",
  "analysis": "The code securely captures email details from user input, constructs an email object, and sends it via Django's email framework. It includes basic error handling for missing fields. No insecure or malicious patterns such as code injection, credential leaks, or backdoors are present. The email sending process is standard, and all data flows are controlled through user input without suspicious manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a straightforward email-sending function with proper input handling and no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and typical for web-based email dispatch.",
