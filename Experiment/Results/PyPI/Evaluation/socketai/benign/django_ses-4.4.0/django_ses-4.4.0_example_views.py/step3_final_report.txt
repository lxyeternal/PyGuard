  "purpose": "Handle user input to send emails via Django's EmailMessage, based on form data submitted through HTTP POST requests.",
  "sources": "request.POST fields: 'subject', 'message', 'from', 'to', 'html-message'",
  "sinks": "EmailMessage constructor and email.send() method, which send email data over the network",
  "flows": "User input from request.POST flows directly into EmailMessage object creation, then to email.send()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious external calls, obfuscation, or malicious payloads; minimal error handling; no input validation or sanitization",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward email handler that constructs and sends emails based on user input. It lacks input validation, which could lead to spam or injection attacks, but no malicious payloads or sabotage are present. No obfuscation or suspicious external network activity is detected. The code's logic is simple and standard, with consistent assessments across all reports. Malware score is correctly 0; obfuscation score is 0; security risk score is low (~0.2) due to lack of validation but no malicious intent. The overall structure and behavior do not indicate malicious activity or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign email handler with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. The primary security concern is the absence of input validation, which could be exploited for spam or injection, but this does not constitute malware or sabotage. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
