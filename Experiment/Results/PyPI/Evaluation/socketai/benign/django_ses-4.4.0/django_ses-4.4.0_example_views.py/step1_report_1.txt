  "purpose": "Handle HTTP requests to render pages and send emails based on user input.",
  "sources": "request.POST data fields: 'subject', 'message', 'from', 'to', 'html-message'.",
  "sinks": "EmailMessage.send() method, which sends emails based on user input.",
  "flows": "User submits form -> server retrieves form data -> constructs EmailMessage -> sends email.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious external calls, no obfuscated code, and no unusual logic found.",
  "analysis": "The code processes user input from an HTTP POST request to send an email via Django's EmailMessage. It retrieves email parameters directly from the request without sanitization or validation, which could lead to misuse such as spam or injection if the underlying email backend is vulnerable. However, there are no indications of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration code. The email content is constructed directly from user input, but this is typical for email forms and not inherently malicious. The code does not include external suspicious calls or hidden behavior. The use of try-except to catch missing fields is standard, and no secret keys or credentials are embedded.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a straightforward email sending operation based on user input. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malware. The main security consideration is ensuring that the email backend and form validation are secure to prevent abuse, but based solely on this code snippet, it appears safe.",
