  "purpose": "To provide web endpoints for rendering pages and sending emails based on user input",
  "sources": "request.POST data fields: 'subject', 'message', 'from', 'to', and optional 'html-message'",
  "sinks": "EmailMessage.send() method which sends email based on user-provided input",
  "flows": "User inputs from request.POST are used directly to construct and send email without validation or sanitization",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code structures, no obfuscated code, straightforward flow",
  "analysis": "The code captures user inputs from POST requests and constructs an email to be sent via Django's EmailMessage. There is no validation or sanitization on the inputs, but this is typical for email forms. No malicious code, backdoors, or abnormal behaviors are present. No code injection, data leaks, or suspicious network activity is evident. The process is a standard email-sending pattern, with minimal security considerations such as input validation missing, but no malicious intent or security breach indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple email form handler with no malicious intent or suspicious behaviors. It securely uses Django's email system, but lacks input validation, which is a security concern but not malicious. No malware or supply chain attack signs are detected.",
