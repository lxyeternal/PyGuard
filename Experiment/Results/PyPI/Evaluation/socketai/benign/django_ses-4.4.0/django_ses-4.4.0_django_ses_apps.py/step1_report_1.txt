{
  "purpose": "Configure Django application settings for the 'django_ses' app, including signal handling for SES bounce and complaint events.",
  "sources": "The code imports signal handlers from the 'django_ses.signals' module and connects signals to handlers.",
  "sinks": "The connect() calls on signals could be considered sinks where data flows into the application's event handling system.",
  "flows": "The code imports handlers and connects signals (bounce_received, complaint_received) to their respective handlers (bounce_handler, complaint_handler), establishing source-to-sink paths within the application's event system.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic detected. The signal connection pattern is standard in Django apps.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Django application configuration that sets up signal handlers for SES bounce and complaint notifications. It imports handlers and connects signals, following common Django patterns. No external data sources, user input, or untrusted data processing occurs here. There are no hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or obfuscated segments. The structure and logic are clear and standard for signal handling setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a normal configuration task in a Django application for handling SES notifications. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this snippet.",
