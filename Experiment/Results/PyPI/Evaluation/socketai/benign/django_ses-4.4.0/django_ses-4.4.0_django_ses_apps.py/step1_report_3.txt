  "flows": "Import signals -> connect signals to handlers in the ready() method.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code. Use of standard Django signal connection pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an AppConfig subclass for a Django app, setting app metadata and establishing signal connections during startup. The signal handlers are imported from the package itself and connected without executing untrusted code or external network interactions. The pattern appears standard and safe, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. No anomalous behavior or security risks detected within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Django app configuration that safely connects signal handlers for the 'django_ses' package. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
