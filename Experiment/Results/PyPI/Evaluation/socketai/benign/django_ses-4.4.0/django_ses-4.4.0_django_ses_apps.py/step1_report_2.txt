{
  "purpose": "Defines a Django application configuration for django_ses, setting up signal handlers for bounce and complaint notifications.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules and connects signal handlers from django_ses.signals within the ready() method.",
  "sinks": "Connecting signal handlers, which could potentially invoke untrusted code if the handlers themselves are malicious or compromised.",
  "flows": "Import statements → ready() method execution → signal connection calls.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django AppConfig subclass. It imports signal handlers and connects them in the ready() method, which is typical for Django apps. There is no data input handling, no use of environment variables, no network operations, and no malicious or suspicious logic detected. The signal handlers are imported from the same package, assuming they are safe and properly implemented. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behavior are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Django app configuration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply connects signals during app startup, which is common practice. No malicious behavior or security issues are evident.",
