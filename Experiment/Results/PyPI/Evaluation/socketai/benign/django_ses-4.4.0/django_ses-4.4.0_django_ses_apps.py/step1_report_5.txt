{
  "purpose": "Configure the Django app 'django_ses' and connect signal handlers related to email bounce and complaint events.",
  "sources": "Import statements from django_ses.signals and the 'ready' method where signal handlers are connected.",
  "sinks": "Connecting signal handlers which could potentially execute untrusted code if the handlers are maliciously replaced or tampered with.",
  "flows": "The 'ready' method imports handlers from 'django_ses.signals' and connects them to corresponding signals, potentially executing code when signals are dispatched.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscated patterns. The code performs standard Django app configuration and signal connection. No external data input or untrusted data flow observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Django AppConfig subclass that sets up signal handlers upon app readiness. It imports signal handler functions from 'django_ses.signals' and connects them to respective signals. There are no suspicious patterns, external data sources, or risky behaviors. The code relies on external modules ('django_ses.signals'), but this is standard for Django apps. No embedded malicious code, backdoors, or abnormal code structures are present. The signal connection process is standard and safe, assuming the imported handlers are legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward Django app configuration for signal handling, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical setup for integrating with email bounce/complaint signals. No malicious intent or security threats are identified based on this code alone.",
