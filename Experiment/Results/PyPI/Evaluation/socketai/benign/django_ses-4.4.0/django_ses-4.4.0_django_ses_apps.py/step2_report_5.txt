  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the provided code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies that the code imports signal handlers and connects signals.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurately describes signal connection as data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states that this is standard Django signal setup, with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.  \n**Verdict:** Fully aligned with the code. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes standard import and connection.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Recognizes that signals invoke handlers, which could be malicious if handlers are compromised.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states this is a typical pattern, with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Recognizes that signal connection could invoke untrusted code if handlers are malicious.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states this is standard Django setup, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9.  \n**Verdict:** Slightly less confident but still reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Recognizes potential risk if handlers are malicious.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately notes that the connection pattern is standard, with no malicious code apparent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.  \n**Note:** The securityRisk is set at 0.1, which is low but acknowledges a minimal potential risk if handlers are malicious. This is cautious but reasonable, given the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Recognizes that connecting signals could execute untrusted code if handlers are malicious.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** States this is a standard setup, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1.  \n**Note:** Similar to Report 4, it assigns a small security risk due to potential issues if handlers are compromised, which is a cautious but reasonable stance.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Security Risk:** Most reports assign 0, with a couple assigning 0.1. This is reasonable because, while the code itself is safe, the signal handlers' content is unknown and could be malicious if compromised. The small risk score reflects this cautious approach.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code snippet is a standard Django app configuration for connecting signals during startup.\n- No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscated logic are present.\n- The potential security concern is the content of the imported handlers, which are not shown. Since the handlers could be malicious if compromised, assigning a small security risk score (0.1) is justified.\n- The malware score remains at 0 across all reports, which is correct given the evidence.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1 (reflecting minimal potential risk if handlers are malicious)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is standard, with no malicious or obfuscated code. The small security risk score is justified due to potential issues with external handlers, but there's no evidence of actual malicious activity.",
