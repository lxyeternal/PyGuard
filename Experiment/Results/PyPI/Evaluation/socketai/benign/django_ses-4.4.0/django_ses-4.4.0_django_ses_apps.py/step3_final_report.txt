  "purpose": "Django application configuration that imports and connects email bounce and complaint signal handlers during startup.",
  "sources": "Imports signal handlers from django_ses.signals module.",
  "sinks": "Connecting signals (bounce_received, complaint_received) to their respective handlers.",
  "flows": "Signal emission triggers connected handlers; handlers execute upon signal reception.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external data sources present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django AppConfig subclass that imports signal handlers and connects them in the ready() method. It follows typical patterns without any obfuscated or malicious code. The signal connection pattern is safe assuming handlers are trustworthy. The scores from the reports correctly reflect the benign nature of this code, with malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a minimal security risk (0.1) due to potential malicious handlers if they are compromised. No evidence suggests malicious intent or obfuscation. The small security risk score is a cautious acknowledgment that if imported handlers are malicious, they could perform harmful actions, but this cannot be determined from the snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Django app configuration for signal handling. All reports correctly identify its safe nature. The malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate at zero. The slight security risk score (0.1) is justified as a precaution, reflecting potential if handlers are malicious, but no actual malicious activity is present. Overall, the code is safe, and the scores are consistent with the analysis.",
