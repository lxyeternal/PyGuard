  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Django app configuration for signal handling. All reports correctly identify its safe nature. The malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate at zero. The slight security risk score (0.1) is justified as a precaution, reflecting potential if handlers are malicious, but no actual malicious activity is present. Overall, the code is safe, and the scores are consistent with the analysis."
