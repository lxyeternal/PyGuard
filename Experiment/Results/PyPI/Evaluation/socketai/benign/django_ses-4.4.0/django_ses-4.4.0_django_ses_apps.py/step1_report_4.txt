  "purpose": "Configure a Django application for the django_ses package and connect signal handlers for email bounce and complaint events.",
  "sources": "The code imports signal handler functions from django_ses.signals and connects them to specific signals.",
  "sinks": "Connecting signals could trigger handler functions upon certain events; if handlers contain malicious code, it could perform unwanted actions.",
  "flows": "Importing signal handlers -> Connecting signals to handlers -> Handlers executed on signal emission",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or unusual code structures. The signal connection pattern is standard for Django apps.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django AppConfig class, setting application metadata. In the 'ready' method, it imports signal handlers from a local module and connects them to specific signals. There is no evidence of code injection, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. The signal handlers are expected to be defined elsewhere, and their safety cannot be verified from this snippet alone, but the connection pattern is standard for Django apps. No anomalies or malicious indicators are present within this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a standard Django app configuration that sets up signal handlers for email event processing. It appears legitimate, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues in this snippet.",
