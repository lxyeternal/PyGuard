{
  "purpose": "Store AWS credentials in the code, likely for authentication with AWS services.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded credential strings assigned to variables AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY.",
  "targets": "These credentials could be used to access AWS resources, potentially leading to unauthorized access if misused.",
  "flows": "Credentials are directly assigned from static strings to variables; these variables may be used later to authenticate with AWS services.",
  "anomalies": "Use of placeholder strings ('YOUR-ACCESS-KEY-ID' and 'YOUR-SECRET-ACCESS-KEY') instead of environment variables or secure storage. Hardcoded credentials are a significant security risk.",
  "analysis": "The code explicitly hardcodes AWS credentials, which is a known security vulnerability. Such practice exposes sensitive access keys within the source code, increasing the risk of credential theft if the code is shared or compromised. No obfuscated code, malicious payload, or malicious behaviors are present. The code does not perform any malicious actions itself but presents a serious security concern due to the insecure handling of secrets.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains hardcoded AWS credentials, which poses a high security risk. It should be replaced with environment variables or secure secret management practices. No malware or malicious behavior detected, but the insecure handling of credentials is a serious security concern.",
