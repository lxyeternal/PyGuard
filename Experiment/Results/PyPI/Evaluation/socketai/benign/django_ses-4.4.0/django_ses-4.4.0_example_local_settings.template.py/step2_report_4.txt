  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code snippet, and evaluate the appropriateness of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Code snippet under review:**\n```python\n# noqa: N999\nAWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = 'YOUR-ACCESS-KEY-ID'\nAWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = 'YOUR-SECRET-ACCESS-KEY'\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Placeholder for AWS credentials.\n- **Findings:** Assigns placeholder strings; no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** securityRisk 0.4, malware 0.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The report correctly identifies that these are placeholders, not real secrets.\n- The security risk is primarily due to the insecure practice of hardcoding, but since they are placeholders, the actual risk is minimal.\n- Malware score is correctly 0; no malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose:** Store AWS credentials, likely for authentication.\n- **Findings:** Hardcoded credentials with placeholder values.\n- **Scores:** securityRisk 0.9, malware 0.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The high securityRisk score (0.9) is justified because hardcoded credentials, even placeholders, can lead to insecure practices if replaced with real secrets.\n- The malware score remains 0, which is appropriate; no malicious activity is indicated.\n- The report emphasizes the risk of improper secret management, which is valid.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose:** Placeholder for AWS credentials.\n- **Findings:** Hardcoded placeholders, no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** securityRisk 0.4, malware 0.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Similar to Report 1, the placeholder nature reduces the risk level.\n- The securityRisk score seems reasonable given the context.\n- Malware remains 0, which is correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose:** Template configuration for AWS credentials.\n- **Findings:** Placeholder values, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** securityRisk 0.3, malware 0.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The lower securityRisk score (0.3) is justified because these are placeholders, not actual secrets.\n- Malware score remains 0, which is correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose:** Store AWS credentials as strings.\n- **Findings:** Placeholder strings, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** securityRisk 0.3, malware 0.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Similar reasoning applies; placeholders pose minimal immediate risk.\n- Malware score is correctly 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are suitable.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary & Recommendations**\n\n- **Code Analysis:** The code contains only placeholder strings for AWS credentials. No actual secrets are embedded, and no malicious code is present.\n- **Malware Score:** Correctly 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Security Risk Scores:** While the practice of hardcoding credentials is insecure, in these cases, the placeholder nature significantly reduces actual risk. The scores range from 0.3 to 0.9, reflecting this.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Justification & Personal Scores**\n\n**Malware:**  \n- **Consensus:** 0 (no malicious activity observed or implied).\n\n**Obfuscated:**  \n- **Consensus:** 0 (no obfuscation detected).\n\n**Risk:**  \n- **Assessment:** Given that these are placeholders, the actual security risk is low if these are not replaced with real secrets. However, the practice of hardcoding is inherently insecure and could lead to issues if secrets are inserted and committed to version control.  \n- **Proposed score:** **0.2 to 0.3** — reflecting the poor practice but low immediate risk in this context.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type | Final Estimate | Justification |\n|--------------|------------------|----------------|\n| Malware      | **0**          | No malicious code or behavior detected. |\n| Obfuscated   | **0**          | No obfuscation present. |\n| Risk         | **0.2 - 0.3**  | Poor secret management practice; low if placeholders are maintained. |\n\n**Note:** The current report scores are reasonable given the context, but I would suggest lowering the securityRisk scores slightly, considering these are placeholders and not actual secrets.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent with the code snippet, and no malicious activity is implied or observed. The main concern is the insecure practice of hardcoding credentials, which should be addressed but does not constitute malware or immediate high risk in this placeholder context.",
