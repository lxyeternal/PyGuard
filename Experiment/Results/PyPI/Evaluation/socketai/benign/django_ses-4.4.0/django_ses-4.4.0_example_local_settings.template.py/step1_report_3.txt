  "purpose": "Define AWS credentials placeholders, likely for use in AWS SDK or CLI configuration.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded credentials assigned to variables AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY.",
  "sinks": "Potential use in code that interacts with AWS services, but no direct data leakage or malicious sink present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Credentials may flow from the variables to AWS SDK calls, but such calls are not shown here.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded credentials with placeholder values is suspicious; indicates potential for secret leakage if actual secrets are committed.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns placeholder strings to variables named as AWS credentials. Hardcoded credentials are a security risk if used in production or committed to version control. There are no malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or network communication in this snippet. The code appears to be a template or placeholder setup rather than malicious code, but the practice of hardcoding secrets is a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains placeholders for AWS credentials, which is a security risk if actual secrets are used. It does not exhibit malicious behavior but highlights poor security practice. The presence of hardcoded secrets warrants caution.",
