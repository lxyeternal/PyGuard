  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded AWS credentials; placeholder values suggest potential risk if used in production",
  "analysis": "The code assigns placeholder strings to AWS credentials. Hardcoded credentials are a security risk if used in production, but as-is, they are placeholders. No malicious code or malicious intent is evident from this snippet. No data leakage or malicious behavior is directly observable, but the insecure practice of hardcoding credentials is flagged.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains placeholder AWS credentials, which are insecure if used in production. No malicious behavior is detected in this snippet, but it demonstrates poor security practice.",
