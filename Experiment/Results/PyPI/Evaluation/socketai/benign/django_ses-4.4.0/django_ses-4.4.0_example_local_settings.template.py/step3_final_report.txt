  "purpose": "The code defines placeholder strings for AWS credentials, intended for use in AWS SDK or CLI configurations.",
  "sources": "Assignment of string literals to AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY variables.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; potential risk if real secrets are inserted and used in sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Input data (credentials) are assigned to variables; no further data flow or processing observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of placeholder strings indicating insecure practice; no malicious or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only placeholder credentials, which are not active secrets. No malicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is evident. The primary concern is insecure secret management practice. Malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0. The security risk score should reflect the insecure practice but is low given the placeholders; a score around 0.2-0.4 is appropriate. Confidence in this assessment is high (0.9), as the code is straightforward and lacks malicious or obfuscated elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only placeholders for credentials. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present. The main issue is insecure secret handling practice, which is not malicious but should be addressed. The scores should be malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: approximately 0.2-0.4, reflecting the insecure practice but current placeholder status.",
