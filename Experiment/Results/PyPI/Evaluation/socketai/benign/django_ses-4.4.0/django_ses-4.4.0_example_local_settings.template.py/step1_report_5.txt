  "purpose": "Store AWS access credentials as string variables",
  "sources": "Assignment of hardcoded strings to AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY",
  "sinks": "Potential use of these credentials for AWS SDK or CLI operations",
  "flows": "Hardcoded credentials could be used directly or exported to environment for AWS access",
  "anomalies": "Presence of placeholder strings 'YOUR-ACCESS-KEY-ID' and 'YOUR-SECRET-ACCESS-KEY' indicates insecure practice; no actual secret data embedded",
  "analysis": "The code defines two variables intended to hold AWS credentials, but they contain placeholder text rather than real secrets. This suggests that the code is either a template or improperly configured. Hardcoded secrets pose security risks if real credentials are used, but as presented, they are just placeholders. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code is evident. The code does not perform any operations or contain logic that could be exploited or cause harm. The main concern is insecure credential handling practice, which could lead to security issues if real secrets are inserted.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains placeholders for AWS credentials, which is a security risk if replaced with real secrets in production. However, it does not exhibit malicious behavior or malicious intent as-is. It is a security concern related to best practices for secret management rather than active malicious code.",
