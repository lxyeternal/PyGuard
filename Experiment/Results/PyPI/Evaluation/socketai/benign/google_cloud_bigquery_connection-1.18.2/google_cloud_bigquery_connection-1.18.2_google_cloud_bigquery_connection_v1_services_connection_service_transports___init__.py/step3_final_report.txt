{
  "purpose": "This code registers transport classes for a connection service, setting up a registry for different transport mechanisms.",
  "sources": "The code reads static class references from local modules during import and dictionary assignment.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process external input or output.",
  "flows": "The code maps string keys to class types in a dictionary, with no dynamic data flow or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific transport classes, registers them in an ordered dictionary, and defines exports. It contains licensing comments and standard Python idioms. There is no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted data. The structure is static and configuration-oriented, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module for registering transport classes within a Python SDK or client library. It poses no security risks or malicious intent.",
