  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the actual code.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- The code is a standard Python module that imports specific transport classes, registers them in an ordered dictionary, and defines exports.\n- No external data sources, user inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The code contains licensing comments and uses standard Python idioms.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The purpose is to set up a registry for transport classes, which is typical in SDK or client library initialization.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1-5 Summary:**\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, standard, and lacks malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- They correctly identify that the code only performs static class registration, with no data flow from untrusted sources.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- Malware scores are all 0, aligning with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n**Potential Issues in the Reports:**\n- The reports are thorough and consistent, with no contradictions or suspicious claims.\n- They correctly note that the code is purely structural and declarative.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring Justification:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 is appropriate; no malicious intent or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 is correct; code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.5 or higher is unnecessary; the code is benign and contains no security risks.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- The code is a typical, safe module for registering transport classes.\n- No modifications needed in the scores.\n- The reports are accurate and justified.\n\n---\n\n### My Own Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, standard code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, and the provided reports are accurate. No security concerns or suspicious patterns are present.",
