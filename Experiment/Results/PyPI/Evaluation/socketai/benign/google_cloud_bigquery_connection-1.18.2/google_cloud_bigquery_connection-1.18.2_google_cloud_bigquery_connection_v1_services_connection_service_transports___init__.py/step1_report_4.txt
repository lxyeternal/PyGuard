{
  "purpose": "This code defines and registers different transport classes for a connection service, allowing selection among gRPC, asyncio, and REST implementations.",
  "sources": "Imports from .base, .grpc, .grpc_asyncio, and .rest modules; hardcoded string keys in _transport_registry.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data processing; the code only sets up class registry and exports.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; initialization of registry from imported modules and static string keys.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code; standard pattern for registry setup.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports transport classes and creates an ordered dictionary to map string identifiers to transport classes. The registry is static and hardcoded. No user input or external data processing occurs. No suspicious functions, no dynamic execution, no credential handling, and no network activity are present. The code appears to be a typical module setup for transport class registration within a larger package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard registry setup for transport classes in a Python package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It functions to organize and expose transport implementations for the connection service.",
