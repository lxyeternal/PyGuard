{
  "purpose": "This code defines and registers different transport classes for a connection service, enabling selection between gRPC, gRPC asyncio, and REST transports.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and classes from the current package, specifically '.base', '.grpc', '.grpc_asyncio', and '.rest'. No external or user input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or output untrusted data or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules, initializes a registry dictionary, and populates it with class references. No data flows from sources to sinks, as there are no untrusted data inputs or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code appears to be standard package setup and registration of classes with proper licensing comments. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward module defining a registry for transport classes used in a connection service. It imports necessary classes, sets up an ordered dictionary, registers class references under specific keys, and declares __all__ for exports. No user inputs, external network operations, or dynamic code execution are present. The code follows standard conventions and licensing practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign module that registers transport classes for a service; it does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It is safe and intended for internal use within a larger application.",
