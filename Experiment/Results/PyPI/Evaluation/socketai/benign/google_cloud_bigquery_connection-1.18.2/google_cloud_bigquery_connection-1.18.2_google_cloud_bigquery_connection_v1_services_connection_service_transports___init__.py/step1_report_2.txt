{
  "purpose": "Define and register transport classes for a connection service in a Python package, including gRPC and REST implementations.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.base, .grpc, .grpc_asyncio, .rest), and the creation of a transport registry dictionary.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or outputs; no external network or file interactions are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Imports are stored in variables; the registry maps strings to transport classes; no dynamic execution or untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The code is straightforward, with standard class and dictionary usage.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary classes for a connection service, then compiles an ordered dictionary mapping string keys to transport class types. The code appears to be part of a larger package setup and uses standard Python idioms without any obfuscated or malicious constructs. No external data, user input, or network activity is present. The code is purely structural and declarative, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module for registering transport classes, with no malicious behavior detected. It appears to be a typical, benign part of a larger SDK or library. No security risks are identified.",
