{
  "purpose": "Provides pagination utilities for iterating through 'list_connections' API responses in Google Cloud BigQuery Connection service.",
  "sources": "API response objects containing connection data, request objects with pagination tokens.",
  "sinks": "Iteration over API responses; no external untrusted data sinks or data leaks.",
  "flows": "API response data flows from the network into response objects, then through iteration methods yielding connection objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code, no obfuscation, standard SDK pattern, no hardcoded secrets or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard pagination classes for Google Cloud SDK, with both synchronous and asynchronous support. It manages request and response objects, handles page tokens for pagination, and yields connection objects. No external data is processed insecurely, no obfuscated code, and no malicious logic is present. The pattern is typical for client SDKs, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of pagination helpers for Google Cloud APIs. It contains no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and poses no security risks.",
