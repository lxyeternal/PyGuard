  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Pagination helpers for BigQuery connections.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Standard API request/response handling, no untrusted data or external effects.\n- Anomalies: None observed.\n- Analysis: Standard SDK pattern, no malicious behavior, no obfuscation.\n- Conclusion: Benign, typical SDK code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar pagination classes.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Standard data flow, no external or untrusted data handling.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Typical client library pattern, no malicious activity.\n- Conclusion: Legitimate, safe code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Pagination for listing connections.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Standard API call wrapping, no external untrusted input.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Standard pattern, no signs of malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Safe, standard implementation.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — slightly above zero, but the reasoning is that it handles API responses securely, and no malicious activity is detected. The risk score could be lowered to 0.0 for consistency.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Pagination for BigQuery connections.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Standard data flow, no untrusted data sinks.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Typical SDK code, no malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Safe.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — again, slightly above zero, but no actual security risk is present. The risk score should be 0.0 for consistency.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Pagination classes.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Standard API data flow, no untrusted data or external effects.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Standard, legitimate code.\n- Conclusion: No malicious activity.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- All reports show standard, benign code with no signs of malware or obfuscation.\n- The \"malware\" scores are all zero, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- The \"obfuscated\" scores are zero, as no obfuscation is present.\n- The \"securityRisk\" scores are very low (0.0 or 0.1/0.2). Given the code's benign nature, these should be 0.0 for consistency and clarity.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 for all reports; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Should be 0.0 across all reports, as no security vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are evident.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThe code is a standard implementation of pagination helpers for Google Cloud APIs, with no malicious or suspicious features.",
