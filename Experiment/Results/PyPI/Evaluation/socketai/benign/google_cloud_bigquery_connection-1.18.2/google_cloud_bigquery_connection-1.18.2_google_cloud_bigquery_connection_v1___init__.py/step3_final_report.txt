{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module interface for Google Cloud BigQuery connection management, providing class and type definitions for SDK users.",
  "sources": "Import statements from external packages and internal module files, including version info and class/type exports.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or external data sinks; primarily static import/export setup.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static module setup with no dynamic or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SDK module comprising licensing comments, import statements, versioning, and an __all__ export list. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or data handling from untrusted sources. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The structure is typical for client library setup, with clear and standard patterns. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
