  "purpose": "The code serves as an API client module for Google Cloud BigQuery Connection Service, providing imports and exports for various connection-related classes and configurations.",
  "sources": "Imports from google.cloud.bigquery_connection_v1 and local module files (.services.connection_service, .types.connection). No direct user input or external data sources are used in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present; the code primarily defines module-level variables and imports.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code consists solely of import statements and module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. The code appears to be a standard module initialization with proper licensing comments and clear structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module that imports specific classes and functions from the Google Cloud BigQuery Connection Service SDK and exports them via __all__. It includes license information and versioning, with no dynamic code execution, user input handling, or external data processing. There are no indications of malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or security issues. It appears to be a benign, well-structured SDK wrapper or client module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal, safe SDK module for Google Cloud BigQuery connections with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It is intended for API interactions and does not contain any malicious or suspicious code.",
