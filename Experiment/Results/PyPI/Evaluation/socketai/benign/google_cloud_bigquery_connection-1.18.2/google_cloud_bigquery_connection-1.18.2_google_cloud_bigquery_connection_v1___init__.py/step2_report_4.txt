  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard SDK module for Google Cloud BigQuery connection services.\n- They consistently note the absence of dynamic code, user input handling, external data processing, or network operations.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code's purpose is to import and expose classes, types, and version info for SDK usage.\n- All reports assign a confidence level of 1, with malware, obfuscated code, and security risk scores at 0.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code matches the description: it's a straightforward module with import statements, licensing info, versioning, and an `__all__` export list.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security issues.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The reports are very consistent and conservative, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n- The malware score remains at 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious content.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which is correct; there's no obfuscation.\n- The security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Scores justification:**\n- The malware score of 0 is justified, as no malicious activity is present.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is justified, given the clear and standard code structure.\n- The overall risk score of 0 also makes sense, considering the code's benign purpose.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, well-structured SDK module with no malicious or suspicious content.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's content.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is benign. No changes to the scores are necessary. The analysis correctly identifies the code as safe, with no malware or obfuscation, and no security risks.",
