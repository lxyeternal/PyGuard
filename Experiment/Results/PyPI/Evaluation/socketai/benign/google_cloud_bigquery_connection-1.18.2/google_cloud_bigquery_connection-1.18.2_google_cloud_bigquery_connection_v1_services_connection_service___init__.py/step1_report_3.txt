{
  "purpose": "This code module appears to be part of a client library providing access to a connection service, likely used for establishing or managing network connections or APIs.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing classes from local modules (.async_client and .client). No external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs, no untrusted data handling, no network calls, no system commands.",
  "flows": "No data flow from input sources to sinks; the code only defines exports.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, only contains import statements and an __all__ export tuple. No suspicious or unusual code features, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated parts.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two client classes, likely for synchronous and asynchronous connection services, and exposes them via __all__. It is a typical module initialization for a Python SDK or client library, with no apparent malicious behavior or security risks. No source-to-sink data flows, no user input handling, no external network or file operations.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard Python module for exposing client classes. It shows no signs of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or security issues. The code serves a purely structural purpose, with no malicious or risky behavior.",
