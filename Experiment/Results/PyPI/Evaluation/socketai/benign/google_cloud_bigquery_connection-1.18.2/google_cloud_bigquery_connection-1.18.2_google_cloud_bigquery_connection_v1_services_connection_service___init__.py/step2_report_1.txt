  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code in question is a simple Python module that imports two classes (`ConnectionServiceAsyncClient` and `ConnectionServiceClient`) from local modules and exposes them via `__all__`.\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, with no dynamic code, no external data handling, no network activity, and no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n- The license header is standard and indicates open-source intent.\n- The code's purpose appears to be module setup for an SDK or client library.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the presence of issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code correctly imports and exposes classes. No issues or errors are evident.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious code are present.\n- **Security concerns:** No untrusted data handling, no external network activity, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Suspicious anomalies:** None detected.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- The reports are consistent; the code is benign and standard. No logical flaws are present.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n  - `confidence`: 1\n\nThese are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code is purely structural, with no runtime logic, data handling, or external interactions, a risk score higher than 0.5 is unwarranted.\n- The malware score of 0 is justified, as there is no malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is justified, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- The overall security risk is zero, consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- No assumptions are made about hidden behavior; the code is transparent.\n- No external dependencies or runtime behaviors are involved that could hide malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nBased on all reports and the code itself, **the code is benign, standard, and free of security issues**.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. There are no signs of malicious or obfuscated code, and the security risk is negligible.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a clean, benign module setup for an SDK or library, with no security concerns.",
