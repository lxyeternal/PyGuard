  "purpose": "This code serves as a module setup for an SDK or client library, exporting specific classes for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules for ConnectionServiceAsyncClient and ConnectionServiceClient.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Import of classes -> exposure via __all__; no data flow beyond module setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and export statements, no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, well-structured Python module that imports two classes and exposes them via __all__. It contains only static import statements and a license header, with no runtime logic, data handling, network activity, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the simplicity and transparency of the code. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), as the code is clear and standard for SDK setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module setup for an SDK or library, with no security concerns or malicious intent. All reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No further action is necessary.",
