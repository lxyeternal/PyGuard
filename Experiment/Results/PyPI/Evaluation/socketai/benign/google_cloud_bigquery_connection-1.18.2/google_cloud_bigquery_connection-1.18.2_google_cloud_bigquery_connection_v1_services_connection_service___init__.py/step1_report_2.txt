  "purpose": "Module for importing and exposing connection service clients, likely part of a larger SDK or library.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .async_client and .client.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code primarily performs import and export of classes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and an __all__ declaration for module exports. It does not perform any data processing, input handling, or network operations. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The license header indicates open-source intent, and the structure is standard for Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module definition with no malicious or security risks. It functions as a clean interface for importing specific classes from internal modules.",
