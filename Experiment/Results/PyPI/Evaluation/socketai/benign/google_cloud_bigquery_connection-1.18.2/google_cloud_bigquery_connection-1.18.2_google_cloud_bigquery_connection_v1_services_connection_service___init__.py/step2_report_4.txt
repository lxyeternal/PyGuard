  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code in question is a minimal Python module that imports two classes (`ConnectionServiceAsyncClient` and `ConnectionServiceClient`) from local modules and exposes them via the `__all__` variable.\n- All reports agree that there are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The code is standard for SDK or library setup, with no data handling, network activity, or external inputs.\n- The license header and structure are typical and do not indicate any suspicious intent.\n\n**Confirming the code's security posture:**\n- The code does not perform any data processing, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n- There are no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no suspicious patterns.\n- The purpose appears to be purely to facilitate module exports for a client library.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which aligns with the straightforward, readable code.\n- The security risk score is 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**Potential issues or logical flaws:**\n- No issues are present in the code or the reports.\n- The reasoning in the reports is sound, with consistent conclusions.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- The assigned scores seem reasonable and justified.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security issues.\n\n**Final conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard, benign module setup for an SDK or client library. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe, with no signs of malware or obfuscation.\n- The scores assigned are justified and should remain as-is.\n- No further action or concern is warranted.",
