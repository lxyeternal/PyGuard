{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package, configuring package metadata, dependencies, and other distribution-related settings.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from a specific file, reading README content, and importing setuptools and os modules.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes untrusted data or uses untrusted input in a way that could lead to security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "The version string is extracted via regex from a file; package metadata is assembled and passed to setuptools.setup().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious external network calls, or obfuscated code detected. The version extraction uses regex but appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs static configuration tasks: reading a version number from a file, reading a README file, and setting up package metadata. The version is extracted with a regex pattern, which is a common and safe practice. No user input is handled dynamically, nor are there any network calls or code execution based on untrusted data. The dependencies are fixed version ranges with explicit exclusions, which is standard for package setup scripts. No suspicious or malicious code behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attack vectors. It performs configuration tasks securely and transparently.",
