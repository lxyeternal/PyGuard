{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package, configuring package metadata, dependencies, and package discovery for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from a local file using regex, reads README content, and package discovery via setuptools.find_namespace_packages().",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network activity, code execution, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Static data reading from files and package configuration; no dynamic or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks: extracting version info with regex, reading README, discovering packages, and calling setuptools.setup() with proper parameters. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or obfuscated logic are present. The version extraction via regex is common and safe here. Dependencies are specified with constraints, following best practices. Overall, the code is a benign, well-structured setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe Python package setup script with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising behavior. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low security risk score are justified and appropriate.",
