  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate and well-structured, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The primary issue is the unsafe use of pickle.dumps() in logging, which could be exploited if logs are compromised. It is recommended to replace pickle with safer serialization methods like JSON for production use to mitigate this risk. Overall, the malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2 to 0.3."
