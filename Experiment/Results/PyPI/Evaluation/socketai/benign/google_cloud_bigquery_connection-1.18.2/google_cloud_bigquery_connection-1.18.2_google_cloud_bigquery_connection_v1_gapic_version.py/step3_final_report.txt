  "purpose": "This code snippet serves as a license header and version metadata for the software module.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only contains comments and a version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code is purely static metadata.",
  "flows": "No data flows exist; the code does not process or transfer data at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present in the code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments and a version variable assignment, with no executable logic, data handling, or network activity. All review reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate given the content. The code's simplicity and clarity confirm the absence of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard open-source license header with version info, posing no security threat or malicious intent. All reports are accurate, and no modifications are necessary.",
