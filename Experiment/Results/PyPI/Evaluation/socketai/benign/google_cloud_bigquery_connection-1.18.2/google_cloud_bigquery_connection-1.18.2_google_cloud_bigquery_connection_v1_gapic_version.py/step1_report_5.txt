{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a header or metadata section for a Python package or module, providing licensing information, version, and encoding details.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the file itself, specifically the comment headers and version variable.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code consists solely of comments and a version assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns; the code is standard for open-source Python modules.",
  "analysis": "The code contains licensing comments, encoding declaration, and a version variable. It does not perform any operations, data processing, or input/output actions. No suspicious or malicious code is present. The content appears to be boilerplate for a package file, typical in open-source projects, with no embedded logic or external data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a metadata header with licensing and version info. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
