  "purpose": "Load airport data from CSV files into dictionaries for lookup by specified code types (ICAO, IATA, LID).",
  "sources": "Reads 'airports.csv' and 'iata_macs.csv' files from local filesystem.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; data is loaded into memory without external communication.",
  "flows": "Reads CSV rows into dictionaries keyed by code type; no external data flow or untrusted input handling beyond file I/O.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward file reading and data organization. It uses standard library functions, with no dynamic execution, network activity, or external data handling. The commented-out CSV writing code is benign. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scoring in the original reports, especially the high risk scores in some, do not align with the benign nature of this static data loader.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign data loader with no malicious intent or security risks. The high risk scores assigned in some reports are unjustified and should be lowered to reflect the actual low threat level. Malware and obfuscation scores are correctly zero. The overall security posture is safe.",
