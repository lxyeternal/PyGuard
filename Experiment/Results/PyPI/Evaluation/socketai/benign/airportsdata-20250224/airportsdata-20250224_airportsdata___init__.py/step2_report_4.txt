  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's behavior, potential vulnerabilities, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward data loader that reads CSV files into dictionaries.\n- No network activity, dynamic code execution, or user input handling.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- Commented-out code for CSV writing is benign and unrelated to runtime behavior.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Review of Each Report\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; loads airport data from CSV files.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior, no obfuscated code, no external communication.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correct; benign data loader.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — **Reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; same as above.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No anomalies, standard file I/O, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid; safe code.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — **Appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious behavior, only local file reading, no external data flow.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Benign; no security risk.\n- **SecurityRisk:** Slightly above zero (0.1) — perhaps due to the mention of reading files, but this is minimal and not inherently risky.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 — **Reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious activity; standard data loading.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — **Appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, only local file I/O.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — **Appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1), which is reasonable given the code's nature—loading local files is low risk but could be marginally increased if considering supply chain concerns, though no actual threat exists.\n\n### My Own Estimate\n\n**Malware:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated:** **0**  \n**Risk:** **0** — the code is a simple data loader with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and conservative in their scoring. The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The slight risk score in some reports reflects the minimal concern about file handling but is justified given the context.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nAll scores are appropriate; no changes needed. The code is safe and well-understood.",
