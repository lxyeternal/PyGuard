  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scoring and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward data loader: reading CSV files into Python dictionaries.\n- No external network, dynamic code execution, or user input handling.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n- Commented-out code for CSV writing is benign and unrelated to runtime behavior.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious activity.\n- The code is consistent in its purpose and behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Finds no malicious behavior.\n- Correctly identifies the code as benign.\n- Confidence: 1.0\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The reasoning is sound; no issues detected.\n- The score aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** **No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Also concludes benign data loading.\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.95), but still high.\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1 (minimal, possibly due to the general nature of data loading).\n\n**Assessment:**\n- No suspicious behavior.\n- The small security risk score seems to be a default or conservative estimate for data loaders.\n- No reason to increase malware or obfuscated scores.\n\n**Verdict:** **No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Similar conclusion: benign data loader.\n- Slightly higher security risk score (0.1), which is acceptable for data loading scripts.\n- Malware: 0\n- Confidence: 1.0\n\n**Assessment:**\n- No malicious activity detected.\n- The security risk score remains appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** **No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Again, a benign data loader.\n- Security risk score: 0 (was 0), which is appropriate.\n- Malware: 0\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The analysis is consistent.\n- No suspicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** **No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Same conclusion: benign data loader.\n- Confidence: 0.95\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**\n- No issues detected.\n- The scores are consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** **No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis:**\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1), which is reasonable given the nature of data loading code.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior detected).\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code).\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 or very close to it, as this is a benign data loader with no external or untrusted input processing.\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion:**\n\n**The reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.** The code is a simple, safe data loader for airport data, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Estimate |\n|------------------|----------------|\n| Malware          | 0              |\n| Obfuscated       | 0              |\n| Security Risk    | 0.0            |\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the detailed analysis.",
