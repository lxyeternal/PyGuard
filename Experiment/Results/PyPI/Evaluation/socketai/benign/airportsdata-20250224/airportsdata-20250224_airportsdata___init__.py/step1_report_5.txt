{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to load and process airport location and timezone data from CSV files for use in a broader application or system.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from 'airports.csv' and 'iata_macs.csv' files located in the same directory as the script.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present in this code; it primarily reads data and constructs in-memory dictionaries.",
  "flows": "Data flows from CSV files through csv.DictReader into dictionaries, with keys determined by CSV columns; no data is sent to external systems or network endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. Commented-out code for CSV writing is present but not executed. The code comments suggest standard data processing without malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries and defines data structures for airports and IATA multi-airport city data. It contains functions to load data from CSV files, mapping airport codes to data dictionaries. The logic is straightforward and typical for data ingestion. No code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The commented-out CSV writing code is standard and not malicious. No unusual or suspicious code features are detected. The code operates solely within the local filesystem context, with no external communication or dynamic code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data loading utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It reads airport data from local CSV files into in-memory dictionaries for further use. There are no anomalies or malicious behaviors identified.",
