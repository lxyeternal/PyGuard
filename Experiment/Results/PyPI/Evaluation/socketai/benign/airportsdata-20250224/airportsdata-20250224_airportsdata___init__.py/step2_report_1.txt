  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's actual behavior, potential vulnerabilities, and the scoring assigned.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code reads static CSV files ('airports.csv' and 'iata_macs.csv') located locally.\n- It loads data into dictionaries with no external network activity, code injection, or dynamic execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- Commented-out code for CSV writing is benign and unrelated to runtime behavior.\n- The functions perform straightforward file I/O and data organization.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Assessment:** Completely benign, no malware, no security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Justification:** The code is a simple data loader with no malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, straightforward data loading.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.95\n- **Analysis of risk score:** The report assigns a high risk score (0.95) despite no malicious activity observed.\n- **Justification:** Since the code is purely static data loading, the risk score should be minimal (e.g., 0). The high score is unjustified.\n\n**Recommendation:** Reduce the risk score to 0.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, no malicious behavior, only data loading.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Analysis:** The risk score is low, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- **Justification:** The slight risk score might reflect minimal concern, but given the code's simplicity, it could be 0.\n\n**Recommendation:** Keep as is or reduce to 0 for consistency.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion—benign data loader.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Justification:** Fully justified.\n\n**No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Assessment:** Also benign, straightforward data ingestion.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Justification:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of findings:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All correctly assign 0.\n- **Risk score:**\n  - Reports 1, 4, 5: correctly 0.\n  - Report 2: unjustifiably high at 0.95; should be lowered.\n  - Report 3: 0.1, acceptable but could be lowered to 0 for consistency.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- **Adjust Report 2 risk score:** from 0.95 to **0**.\n- **Adjust Report 3 risk score:** from 0.1 to **0** (optional, for consistency).\n\n---\n\n### **Overall malware and obfuscated scores:**\n\n- All reports correctly indicate no malware or obfuscation.\n- **Estimated malware score:** **0**.\n- **Estimated obfuscated score:** **0**.\n- **Estimated risk score:** **0** for all, except possibly 0.0 for Reports 2 and 3.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a benign, straightforward data loader with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The only inconsistency is the high risk score in Report 2, which should be lowered to accurately reflect the code's security profile.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always ensure risk scores reflect the actual threat level; static data loading code with no external communication or dynamic execution warrants a risk score of zero.",
