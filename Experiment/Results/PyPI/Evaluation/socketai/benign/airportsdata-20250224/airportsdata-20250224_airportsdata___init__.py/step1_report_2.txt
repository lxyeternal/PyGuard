{
  "purpose": "The code loads and processes airport location and timezone data from CSV files for use in geographic and logistical applications.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from local CSV files named 'airports.csv' and 'iata_macs.csv' located in the same directory as the script.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that send untrusted data externally or perform potentially malicious actions; the code only reads local files and processes data internally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from CSV files into Python dictionaries via csv.DictReader; these are stored in memory but not transmitted or written elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present. The code structure is straightforward and standard for data loading.",
  "analysis": "The script defines data structures for airports and multi-airport city groupings, loads CSV data into dictionaries, and offers functions to access this data. It does not perform network communication, execute code dynamically, or handle untrusted input beyond reading local files. The commented-out code for saving CSV suggests local data management only. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or sabotage. The functions rely solely on local file I/O, and the data loading process appears standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data loader for airport and city data without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It handles data internally and securely, with no external communication or risky operations.",
