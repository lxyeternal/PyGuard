{
  "purpose": "The code loads airport data from CSV files into dictionaries for use in location-based applications, providing functions to load individual airports and multi-airport city data.",
  "sources": "Reads CSV files 'airports.csv' and 'iata_macs.csv' from the filesystem using Path and open, parsing data with csv.DictReader.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is written or transmitted; data is only loaded into memory structures.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file input via csv.DictReader into in-memory dictionaries; no external data flows or network transmission observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behaviors such as obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hardcoded secrets. The code contains commented-out code for saving CSV data, which is benign. No backdoors, credential theft, or privacy violations detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily reads static CSV files containing airport and city data. It converts CSV rows into dictionaries keyed by ICAO, IATA, or LID codes, and builds a multi-airport city structure. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection. All file operations are straightforward, and the code relies on local data files. No suspicious patterns or anomalies are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign data loading utility for airport location information. It does not contain malware, malicious code, or security risks. The functions serve to organize static data into accessible dictionaries, with no signs of supply chain threats or malicious behavior.",
