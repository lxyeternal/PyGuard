{
  "purpose": "To load and manage airport location and timezone data from CSV files for lookup purposes.",
  "sources": "CSV files ('airports.csv' and 'iata_macs.csv') read via Path.open() in load() and load_iata_macs() functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present that process untrusted data into system commands, network, or files; data is only loaded into in-memory structures.",
  "flows": "CSV data flows from files into Python dictionaries without modification, then returned for use; no processing of untrusted external input into system actions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. No dynamic execution, network calls, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily reads CSV files containing airport data into dictionaries, with minimal processing. No external inputs besides static CSV files are used. The data structures are standard Python dictionaries with typed annotations. There are no network operations, no code injection, and no apparent attempts at malicious activity. Commented-out code for CSV writing is benign and unrelated to runtime behavior. The code appears to be a straightforward data loading utility with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data loader for airport information, with no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It does not process untrusted input in a way that could lead to vulnerabilities or exploits.",
