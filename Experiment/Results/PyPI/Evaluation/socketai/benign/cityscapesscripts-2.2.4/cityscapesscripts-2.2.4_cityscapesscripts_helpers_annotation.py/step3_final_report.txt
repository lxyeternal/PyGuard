  "purpose": "Data models for image annotation objects, including polygons, bounding boxes, 3D boxes, and ignore regions, with JSON serialization/deserialization and file I/O.",
  "sources": "JSON files and strings, file system for reading/writing annotation data",
  "sinks": "JSON output, file system for saving annotation data",
  "flows": "JSON data read from files or strings -> object instances -> JSON data written back",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code detected; locale setting in updateDate is benign and standard",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward data classes for annotations, with JSON serialization/deserialization, file I/O, and date handling. No network activity, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. The locale setting in updateDate is a benign attempt to ensure consistent date formatting. The code is well-structured, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for managing annotation data. It shows no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are consistent with its functionality and behavior.",
