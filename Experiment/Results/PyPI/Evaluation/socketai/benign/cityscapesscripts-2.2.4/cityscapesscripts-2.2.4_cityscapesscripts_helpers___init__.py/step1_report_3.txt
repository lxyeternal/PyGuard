  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to involve some form of data processing or interaction with external resources.",
  "sources": "Data is read from environment variables, imported modules, and possibly user input or external data sources (not explicitly shown).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file operations, or environment variables being modified or accessed. Specific sinks are not explicitly detailed in the code snippet provided.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or external sources through processing functions to sinks such as network or file operations. Exact flow paths are unclear due to missing context.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code were detected. The code uses standard imports and practices; no suspicious or unusual code structures are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to perform typical operations without unusual complexity or obfuscation. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or data theft mechanisms. The structure is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious functions. Without additional context or specific external data sources, no malicious or suspicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no indication of malicious intent or security risks. The code seems benign, with no signs of malware or malicious behavior. Confidence in this conclusion is high, but limited by the absence of detailed context or complete code.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
