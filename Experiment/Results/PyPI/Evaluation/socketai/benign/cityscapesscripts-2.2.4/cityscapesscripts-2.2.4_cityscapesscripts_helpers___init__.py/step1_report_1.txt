  "purpose": "This code appears to be a standard Python script that performs some data processing and outputs results. There is no clear indication of malicious intent or harmful operations.",
  "sources": "Reads data from input files, environment variables, or network sources (if any).",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to console, files, or network endpoints.",
  "flows": "Data is read from sources, processed internally, and then output or sent over network.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URL, or unusual obfuscation detected. No backdoors or hidden code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports common modules, performs data operations, and outputs results. No obfuscated code or suspicious functions are present. No malicious API calls or data exfiltration mechanisms identified. The structure is straightforward with typical data handling patterns. Lack of hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity reduces concern. The code does not perform any unsafe SQL, environment variable misuse, or code injection. Based on the provided snippet, no malicious or maliciously intended behaviors are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no evidence of malware or malicious activity. It is standard in function and structure, with no suspicious signals detected.",
