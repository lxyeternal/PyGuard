  "purpose": "Assess open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code analysis, suspicious signals, obfuscation, and potential malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, external data sources, user inputs, network interactions, and code execution points.",
  "sinks": "Data leaks, network transmissions, system modifications, or execution of untrusted code paths.",
  "flows": "From data sources (inputs, environment variables) to sinks (network, system modifications), possibly via dynamic execution or external resource handling.",
  "anomalies": "Signs of potential obfuscation, handling of untrusted data, dynamic code execution, or suspicious network activity; presence of incomplete code or signs of data manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily benign across most reports, with no explicit malicious signals or obfuscation detected. Report 4 indicates potential handling of untrusted data and signs of obfuscation, suggesting a slight increase in suspicion. The malware scores are generally zero, with a minor exception in Report 4, which merits a slightly higher malware score. Obfuscation scores are zero, aligning with the absence of obfuscation evidence. Security risks are low overall but slightly elevated in reports mentioning untrusted data handling. Confidence levels are high in benign assessments and moderate where potential risks are noted. The scores are consistent with the detailed reasoning in each report.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports indicate benign code with appropriate low malware and obfuscation scores. Slight suspicion in Report 4 warrants a marginally increased malware score (0.2) and risk score (0.4). Overall, the dependency appears safe with minimal security concerns, but cautious handling of untrusted data should be maintained. Final adjusted scores reflect a conservative but justified security posture.",
