  "purpose": "Setup script for building and installing the cityscapesScripts package, including optional Cython compilation.",
  "sources": "Environment variable CYTHONIZE_EVAL, file reads (README.md, VERSION), import statements, package configuration data.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data output or code execution based on user input.",
  "flows": "Environment variable CYTHONIZE_EVAL triggers Cython compilation; file reads load package info; setup configuration defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The code performs standard setup tasks. No obfuscated code features or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally compiles a Cython extension based on an environment variable, which is standard practice. It reads README and VERSION files to include metadata, and defines package info, dependencies, and entry points. No external inputs or untrusted data flows are detected. The environment variable controls optional compilation, not malicious behavior. The package dependencies include common libraries; nothing suspicious. No network operations, data leaks, or code injections are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with optional Cython compilation. No malicious intent or security risks are identified. It appears to be a legitimate build configuration script.",
