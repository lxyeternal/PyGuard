  "purpose": "Setup script for the cityscapesScripts Python package, managing dependencies, optional Cython compilation, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md, VERSION file, environment variables for build control, and package metadata.",
  "sinks": "Environment variables influence build process; no data leaks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'CYTHONIZE_EVAL' triggers Cython build; sets compiler variables; reads files for metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional setting of 'CC' and 'CXX' to 'g++' when 'CYTHONIZE_EVAL' is present; standard in build scripts but could be manipulated if environment is compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python setup script with optional Cython extension compilation controlled via environment variables. It reads metadata files, sets environment variables for compiler selection, and defines entry points. No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code patterns are detected. The use of environment variables and setting compiler variables is common in build processes, though it could be exploited if the environment is maliciously manipulated. Overall, the script is straightforward, well-structured, and aligns with standard packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, benign setup configuration for a Python package. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The minimal security concern relates to environment variable manipulation, which is typical in build scripts but should be managed securely. Final scores reflect this assessment.",
