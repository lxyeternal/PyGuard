  "purpose": "Provide helper functions and classes for handling Cityscapes dataset files and output formatting.",
  "sources": "Input data is primarily filenames and command-line arguments; environment variables are not explicitly used.",
  "sinks": "Writing JSON files, printing error messages, creating directories, and system exit functions.",
  "flows": "Filename parsing functions (getCsFileInfo, getCoreImageFileName) process filenames; writeDict2JSON writes data to disk; printError terminates execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code; no hardcoded credentials or secret data; no obfuscated or malicious code detected. Use of sys.exit() for error handling is standard.",
  "analysis": "The script provides utility functions for filename parsing, colorized output, and file system operations. It imports common libraries, including PIL and numpy, for image processing, but does not invoke them maliciously. The getCsFileInfo function parses filename structure, which could potentially be manipulated if filenames are user-controlled, but no malicious intent is evident. The writeDict2JSON function serializes data to a JSON file in a straightforward manner. No code injects untrusted input into system commands, and no network or data exfiltration activities are present. The printError function calls sys.exit(), which is standard for error handling. Overall, the code is purely utility-based with no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility script for dataset handling with no malicious intent or malicious behavior. It performs filename parsing, output formatting, directory creation, and JSON writing securely. There are no signs of malware, suspicious data flows, or sabotage activities.",
