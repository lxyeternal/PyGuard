  "purpose": "Utility functions for Cityscapes dataset filename parsing, directory management, JSON serialization, and colorized output formatting.",
  "sources": "Filename parsing functions, directory path functions, error handling via printError, and JSON writing functions.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input in a way that leads to security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Filename input processed by getCsFileInfo and getCoreImageFileName; directory paths obtained via getDirectory; error messages trigger sys.exit(); JSON data written via writeDict2JSON.",
  "anomalies": "Use of sys.exit() for error handling, which could abruptly terminate processes but is standard in scripts; no malicious or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for filename parsing, directory handling, JSON serialization, and output formatting. It imports standard libraries and dataset-specific helpers but does not perform network operations, credential handling, or dynamic code execution. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns are present. Error handling with sys.exit() is typical for scripts but could be disruptive if misused. Overall, the code is straightforward, benign, and serves dataset management purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: ~0.1) are appropriate and justified given the code's functionality. No further security concerns are identified.",
