  "purpose": "Helper methods and includes for Cityscapes dataset processing, such as filename parsing, color output, and JSON writing.",
  "sources": "File system functions (os.path, os.makedirs), JSON file writing, input filename parsing, and data attributes in functions like getCsFileInfo.",
  "sinks": "Writing JSON files (writeDict2JSON), printing error messages, system exit on errors.",
  "flows": "Input filename parsing in getCsFileInfo and getCoreImageFileName, data writing in writeDict2JSON, error handling in printError leading to sys.exit().",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, no unusual data flows. Usage of sys.exit() in printError is typical for scripts but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides utility functions for filename parsing, colorized output, directory creation, and JSON serialization. The getCsFileInfo function parses filenames into structured components. writeDict2JSON serializes dictionaries to JSON files. printError outputs errors and terminates execution. No external network activity, no credential handling, and no dynamic code execution are present. The code structure is straightforward, with no signs of malicious obfuscation or hidden behaviors. The only potentially concerning aspect is the use of sys.exit() on errors, which could disrupt workflows but does not pose a security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for dataset handling with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It performs filename parsing, color output, directory creation, and JSON writing without any suspicious or malicious activity. The likelihood of malicious intent is very low.",
