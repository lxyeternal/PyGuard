  "purpose": "Helper methods and utilities for Cityscapes dataset processing, including filename parsing, color coding, and directory management.",
  "sources": "File system operations (os.path functions, os.makedirs), input filenames, JSON file writing, module imports",
  "sinks": "File writing (writeDict2JSON), sys.exit, print output, directory creation",
  "flows": "Filename parsing -> Directory management -> JSON writing -> Program termination",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code performs standard utility functions. No obfuscated code, suspicious network activity, or malicious system modifications detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports common modules for file handling, JSON serialization, and dataset-specific helpers. It defines utility functions for parsing filenames, ensuring directory existence, printing errors, and writing JSON data. The functions are straightforward and do not contain any suspicious logic. The getCsFileInfo function parses filenames based on expected patterns; getColorEntry provides color coding for values. No dynamic code execution, network communication, or sensitive data handling occurs. The only exit point is a controlled sys.exit call upon error. The code is mainly utility-focused and does not exhibit malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for dataset management with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs filename parsing, directory management, and JSON output without any suspicious or malicious features.",
