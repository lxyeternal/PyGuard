  "anomalies": [
    "The function printError terminates the program via sys.exit, which is normal for error handling but can be exploited if misused.",
    "No hardcoded credentials, environment variables, or network activity.",
    "No obfuscated code or unusual language features.",
    "Standard library functions used appropriately."
  ],
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for filename parsing, directory creation, and JSON serialization. It does not include any external data input handling or network operations. Error handling via printError and sys.exit is standard; no malicious use of sys.exit is detected. The writeDict2JSON function safely serializes dictionaries into JSON files using standard libraries. No suspicious code, hidden backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. No evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. Overall, the code appears to be purely helper functions for dataset management with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of dataset helper utilities with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It performs file parsing, directory management, and JSON writing safely without any network activity or sensitive data handling. No security risks are identified.",
