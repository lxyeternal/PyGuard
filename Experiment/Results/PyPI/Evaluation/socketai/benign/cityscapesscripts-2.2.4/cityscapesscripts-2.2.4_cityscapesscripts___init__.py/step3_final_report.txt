  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "No code provided; references to environment variables, user input, or data flows without specific code context.",
  "sinks": "Potential data sinks include network connections, file operations, environment variables, or dynamic code execution points, but none are explicitly identified.",
  "flows": "No concrete source-to-sink flows due to absence of code; assumptions based on typical data handling patterns.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code or suspicious patterns; no obfuscation or malicious functions detected; reliance on descriptions rather than actual code.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the lack of code or suspicious features. Scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are consistent with the minimal information and low suspicion. Confidence scores reflect the limited data, and no report overstates risks. The assessments are cautious yet appropriate, with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. Given the absence of code, the low risk and malware scores are justified. Slight adjustments are unnecessary; the current scores accurately represent the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The provided reports are consistent and appropriate given the lack of code and suspicious activity. No modifications are necessary. The overall assessment indicates no malicious behavior or significant security concerns based on available information.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
