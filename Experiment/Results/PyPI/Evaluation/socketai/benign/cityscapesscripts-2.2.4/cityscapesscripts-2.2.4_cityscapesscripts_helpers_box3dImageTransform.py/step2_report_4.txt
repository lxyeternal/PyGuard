  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a set of geometric transformation tools for 3D bounding boxes, coordinate conversions, and projections.\n- No reports identify any external I/O (network, file system, system commands), credentials, or backdoors.\n- The code relies on standard libraries (numpy, pyquaternion) and performs mathematical operations typical for 3D vision tasks.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious constructs, or malicious behaviors are reported.\n- The confidence scores are high (0.9), indicating the reviewers are quite certain of their assessments.\n- Malware scores are zero or very low, and no report suggests malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Logical Consistency:\n- The code does **not** perform any network communication, file I/O, or command execution.\n- The transformations are standard, involving coordinate conversions, quaternion rotations, and projections.\n- No suspicious or malicious code patterns are evident.\n- The purpose is clearly for 3D geometry processing in autonomous driving contexts.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No logical errors or flaws are identified in the reports.\n- The reasoning about the code's safety and purpose is consistent and well-founded.\n\n### Scores Evaluation:\n- All reports assign **malware = 0** and **securityRisk = 0 or very low (0.1 - 0.2)**, which aligns with the absence of malicious indicators.\n- The **obfuscated** score is 0, consistent with the straightforward, well-structured code.\n- The **risk scores** are very low, which is appropriate given the context.\n\n### Justification for higher risk scores:\n- Since the code performs purely geometric calculations without any external or malicious behavior, higher scores are unwarranted.\n- The only minor concern might be the complexity of mathematical operations, but that is typical for this domain and does not imply malicious intent.\n\n### Consistency Check:\n- The scores across reports are consistent with the described code and their analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\nBased on the detailed reviews, the code is a standard, legitimate implementation for 3D bounding box transformations in autonomous driving applications. No malicious or security-compromising behavior is evident.\n\n**Proposed scores:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Additional note:** Given the comprehensive nature of the code and the consistent findings, I agree with the current assessments.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The code is a standard, well-structured implementation for 3D geometric transformations.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or security-compromising behaviors are present.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the scores as they are, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and risk scores at 0, reflecting the benign nature of this code.",
