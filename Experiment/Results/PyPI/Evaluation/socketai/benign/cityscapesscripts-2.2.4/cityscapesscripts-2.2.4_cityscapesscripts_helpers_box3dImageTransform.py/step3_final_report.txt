  "purpose": "The code provides geometric transformations, coordinate conversions, and projections for 3D bounding boxes in autonomous vehicle perception tasks, including calibration and visualization.",
  "sources": "Input data includes annotation objects (size, rotation, center), camera parameters, and transformation matrices; these are used internally for coordinate conversions.",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks, network communication, or file I/O are present; data flows through mathematical transformations within the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from annotations and camera parameters through coordinate transformations, quaternion rotations, and projection matrices to generate 2D and 3D bounding box vertices and visualizations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, backdoors, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation are detected; code is straightforward and domain-specific.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard 3D geometric operations using numpy and pyquaternion, converting between coordinate systems, applying rotations, and projecting 3D points onto 2D image planes. It does not include network activity, file I/O, or system commands. The mathematical operations are typical for calibration and visualization in autonomous driving contexts. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code is well-structured, with clear purpose and no suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation for 3D bounding box transformations and visualization, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is domain-specific, well-structured, and safe for use.",
