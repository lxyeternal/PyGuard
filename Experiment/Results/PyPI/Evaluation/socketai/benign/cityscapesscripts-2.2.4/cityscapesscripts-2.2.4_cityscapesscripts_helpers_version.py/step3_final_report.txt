  "purpose": "Read and display the contents of a version file located relative to the script's directory.",
  "sources": "File system read operation on '../VERSION' relative to the script's directory.",
  "sinks": "Printing the content to standard output.",
  "flows": "File is opened, read, and its content is printed; no external data flows or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward file I/O with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python libraries to open and read a file named 'VERSION' located one directory above the script. It then prints the content. The logic is simple, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or hardcoded secrets. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious intent is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's straightforward and safe operation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version display script with no security issues or malicious behavior. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
