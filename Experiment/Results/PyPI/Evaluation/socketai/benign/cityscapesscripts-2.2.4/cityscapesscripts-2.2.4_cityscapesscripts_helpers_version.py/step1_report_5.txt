  "purpose": "Read and print the content of a version file located relative to the script's directory.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'VERSION' file from a parent directory relative to the script's location.",
  "sinks": "Printing the version string to standard output.",
  "flows": "File reading source flows to the version variable, then printing flows to the console.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; simple file read and print operation with no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code securely reads a version string from a file located one directory above the script's location. The use of os.path.join and os.path.dirname ensures cross-platform compatibility and relative path resolution. The file is opened in a context manager, preventing resource leaks. The script outputs the read version, which is a benign operation. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. No external data is fetched, and no sensitive information is processed or transmitted.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a straightforward version file reader and printer with no indication of malicious behavior or security issues.",
