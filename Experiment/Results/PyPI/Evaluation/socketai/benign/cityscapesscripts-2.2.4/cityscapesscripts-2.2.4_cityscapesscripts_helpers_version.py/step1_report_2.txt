  "purpose": "Read and display the version information from a file named 'VERSION' located in the parent directory of the script.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'VERSION' file located relative to the script's directory.",
  "sinks": "Printing the version information to standard output.",
  "flows": "File read operation (source) to variable assignment, then printing to stdout (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code detected. The code straightforwardly reads and prints a file.",
  "analysis": "The script imports os to determine its directory, then reads the 'VERSION' file in the parent directory. The content is stored in 'version' and printed if the script runs as main. No external network activity, no input handling beyond reading a local file, and no suspicious behavior observed. The code appears to serve a simple version display purpose without any malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to read and print version information from a local file. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
