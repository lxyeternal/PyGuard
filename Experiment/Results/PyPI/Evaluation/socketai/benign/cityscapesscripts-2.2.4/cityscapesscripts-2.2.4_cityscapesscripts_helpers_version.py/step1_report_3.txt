{
  "purpose": "Read the version information from a file named 'VERSION' located one directory above the script and print it when executed.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a file located at a relative path ('../VERSION') based on the script's directory.",
  "sinks": "The script outputs the read version string to standard output (console).",
  "flows": "The code reads from the file path derived from the script's location and then prints the content directly to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs a straightforward file read with no hardcoded credentials, environment variables, or suspicious data handling. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The script simply reads a version number from a file located relative to its directory and prints it. It does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration. The approach appears standard for version retrieval. No signs of malicious behavior or anomalies such as hidden backdoors, malicious data leaks, or obfuscation are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign script designed for version display purposes. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks within this code.",
