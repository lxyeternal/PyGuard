  "purpose": "Read and print the contents of a version file located relative to the script's directory.",
  "sources": "The code reads from a file located at '../VERSION' relative to the script's directory.",
  "sinks": "The script outputs the version information to standard output.",
  "flows": "The file content is read from disk (source) and then printed to console (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. The code straightforwardly reads and prints a file.",
  "analysis": "The script dynamically reads a version string from a file located one directory up from its current location. It then outputs this version to the console. The code uses standard libraries and simple file I/O operations. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious code activity. It appears to serve a benign purpose of version reporting.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, designed solely to read a version string from a file and print it. No malicious intent or security issues are detected.",
