  "flows": "Filesystem read operation -> print to stdout",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious environment variable usage, no dynamic code execution or network activity",
  "analysis": "The code simply opens a file named 'VERSION' located one directory above the script's directory, reads its contents, and prints it. The process involves standard file I/O with no user input, environment variables, or external network interactions. The purpose appears to be to display version information. No malicious patterns or suspicious behavior are present. The code is straightforward and does not perform any insecure operations or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves to output version information. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
