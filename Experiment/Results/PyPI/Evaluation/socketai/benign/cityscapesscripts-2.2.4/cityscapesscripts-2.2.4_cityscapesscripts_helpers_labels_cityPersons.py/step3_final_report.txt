  "purpose": "Defines dataset labels and metadata for CityPersons dataset annotations.",
  "sources": "Static data structures: label definitions, dictionaries for lookup.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data input/output, no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A; static definitions only, no data flow from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and contains no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, defines a namedtuple for labels, creates a list of label instances with metadata, and constructs lookup dictionaries. There are no dynamic operations, external inputs, network activity, or obfuscation. The code serves purely as static data definitions for dataset annotations. No signs of malicious behavior, security vulnerabilities, or obfuscation are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are justified given the static, benign nature of the code. Confidence is high (1.0) as the analysis is straightforward and conclusive.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static dataset label definition module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The provided reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
