  "purpose": "Define labels and metadata for CityPersons annotations, including label properties and lookup dictionaries.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__ (print_function, absolute_import, division), collection namedtuple, label definitions list",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows to untrusted sources or external systems",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code constructs; the code is straightforward and standard for defining label metadata",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard Python modules, defines a namedtuple for labels, and creates a list of label instances with descriptive properties. It then constructs lookup dictionaries for fast access by name and ID. There are no input/output operations, network calls, or suspicious behaviors. No obfuscation or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, straightforward definition of label metadata for a dataset, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
