{
  "purpose": "Define and organize city person labels with associated metadata for annotation or evaluation tasks.",
  "sources": "Import statements for future features and collections; the list 'labelsCp' which contains label definitions.",
  "sinks": "None present. No untrusted data input or output functions are identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code mainly sets up static data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code strictly defines data structures and mappings.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features for compatibility, defines a namedtuple 'LabelCp' for label metadata, and creates a list of label instances 'labelsCp' with specific properties. It then creates two lookup dictionaries for quick label retrieval by name and id. There are no functions executing untrusted data, no network or I/O operations, and no dynamic code execution. The code appears to be a straightforward data definition module for labeling in a computer vision context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration module for labeling data. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It simply defines label metadata for use elsewhere.",
