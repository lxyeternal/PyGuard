  "purpose": "Defines labels and metadata for CityPersons dataset, used for object detection and evaluation.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__ for compatibility, collections for namedtuple, data definitions in the code itself.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources or external systems are present.",
  "flows": "Data is stored in data structures (dictionaries and lists) but no flow of untrusted data to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; straightforward data definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines label metadata for a dataset, including label names, IDs, attributes, and color codes. It imports standard modules and creates data structures without executing any malicious actions. There are no inputs, external calls, network operations, or data leaks. The code appears to be a benign dataset annotation setup with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple dataset label definition with no malicious intent or security risks. It only establishes data structures for labeling purposes and contains no suspicious or harmful behavior.",
