  "purpose": "Define labels and metadata for CityPersons dataset annotations.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write or transmit data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only sets up in-memory data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious constructs; the code solely defines data structures and constants.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and defines a namedtuple for labels, along with a list of label instances with metadata such as names, IDs, colors, and evaluation flags. It creates lookup dictionaries for labels by name and ID. There are no external data reads, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no hardcoded secrets or credentials. The structure is straightforward and typical for dataset annotation definitions. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple dataset label definition module with no malicious intent or security concerns. It appears to be safe, intended solely for dataset annotation purposes.",
