Slight suspicion in Report 4 warrants a marginally increased malware score (0.2) and risk score (0.4). Overall, the dependency appears safe with minimal security concerns, but cautious handling of untrusted data should be maintained. Final adjusted scores reflect a conservative but justified security posture."
