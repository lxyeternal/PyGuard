{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to perform some form of data processing or network communication, potentially as part of a larger application or library.",
  "sources": "Data is read from environment variables, function parameters, and potentially external modules or APIs.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could reach network communication functions, file operations, or system calls that could cause data leaks or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Data from environment variables or input parameters flows into processing functions, which may then send data over the network or write to files, creating potential source-to-sink pathways.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation detected. Unusual code constructs or dynamic execution are not present. Usage of standard libraries appears normal. No suspicious domain connections or data exfiltration routines are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code reads data from environment variables and function parameters, processes this data, and performs network or file operations. No evidence of malicious payloads, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network connections, was observed. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The code does not perform unsafe SQL, dangerous eval, or exec calls. The overall logic appears to be legitimate processing without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior or malware. It appears to be standard application code with no malicious or suspicious elements. Based on the provided code, the security risk is low.",
