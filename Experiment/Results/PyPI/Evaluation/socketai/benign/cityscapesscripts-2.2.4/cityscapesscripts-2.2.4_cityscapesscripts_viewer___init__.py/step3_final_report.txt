  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, user input, network or file operations, standard module imports.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file system writes, environment variable access, system commands.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks via function calls, data processing, or dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "All reports consistently describe benign, straightforward code with no malicious indicators. Malware scores are 0, obfuscation scores are 0, and security risks are low (~0.2), with the exception of report 4 which is slightly overestimated at 0.3. Given the absence of concrete suspicious patterns, the risk score for report 4 should be adjusted downward to 0.2, and confidence increased from 0.7 to 0.8. The overall assessment aligns with the descriptions, indicating minimal threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate, with a minor adjustment to the risk score in report 4 from 0.3 to 0.2 for consistency. Overall, the dependency appears safe for use.",
