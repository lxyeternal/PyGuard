  "purpose": "Defines cityscape labels with associated metadata, including utility functions for label management and lookups.",
  "sources": "Static label definitions, label name input in utility functions, and demonstration print statements.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data input/output, network calls, or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Label definitions are used for lookups; no external data flows or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static dataset with lookup dictionaries and a utility function for label name validation. It contains no external data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The purpose is purely to manage label metadata for Cityscapes dataset. The structure is clear, well-organized, and free of malicious or suspicious elements. No obfuscation or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and purpose-specific, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and overall security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
