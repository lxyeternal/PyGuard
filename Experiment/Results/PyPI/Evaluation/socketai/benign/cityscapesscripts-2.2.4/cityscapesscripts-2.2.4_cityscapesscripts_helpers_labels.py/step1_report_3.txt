{
  "purpose": "Define and manage cityscape labels with meta information, enabling lookup and categorization for autonomous vehicle perception systems.",
  "sources": "Data sources include the label definitions list, dictionary lookups (name2label, id2label, trainId2label, category2labels), and the input parameter 'name' in the assureSingleInstanceName function.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the print statements that output label information and the lookup operations that access label data structures.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from the 'name' parameter to dictionary lookups; label data is retrieved via these mappings; output flows through print statements displaying label attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors detected. The code appears purely for label management and debugging. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated constructs, or suspicious imports are present.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a set of labels for cityscape segmentation, creating various lookup dictionaries for efficient access. The 'assureSingleInstanceName' function processes label names to determine if they refer to individual instances, handling 'group' suffix removal and existence checks. The main block is for testing and debugging, printing label details and demonstrating lookups. No network operations, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are evident. All code appears standard and appropriate for its purpose, with no suspicious anomalies or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, well-structured label management utility with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It solely manages label data and provides lookup functions. The code is safe for use in larger systems.",
