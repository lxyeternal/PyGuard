{
  "purpose": "Define and manage cityscape labels for image segmentation, including labels, categories, and utility functions.",
  "sources": "Code imports collections and namedtuple; all label definitions and mappings are hardcoded within the script; no external data inputs.",
  "sinks": "The script prints label info to stdout; no sinks are present that handle untrusted input or produce output to external systems, network, or file systems.",
  "flows": "The script primarily flows from label definitions and mappings to print outputs; no data flows from external untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs; code is straightforward and declarative.",
  "analysis": "The code defines label metadata for cityscape images, creating mappings for quick lookup. Functions like assureSingleInstanceName process label names to identify singleton instances. The main block prints label details and performs example lookups. There are no external data inputs, network connections, or potential injection points. The code is standard, structured, and intended for label management and display only.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign, purpose-specific utility for managing cityscape labels with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not handle untrusted input, perform external communications, or contain obfuscated or malicious code segments.",
