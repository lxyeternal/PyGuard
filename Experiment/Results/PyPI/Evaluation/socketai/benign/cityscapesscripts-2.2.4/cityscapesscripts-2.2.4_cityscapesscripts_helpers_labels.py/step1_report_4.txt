  "purpose": "Defines cityscape labels, their metadata, and utility functions for label lookup and processing.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, collections, and internal data structures defining labels and lookup dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "Print statements for demonstration; no untrusted data input, external system calls, or data leakage points detected.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; mainly static data definitions and simple lookups.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors observed. No obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily defines label metadata for cityscape annotations, creates lookup dictionaries for labels, and includes a utility function for label name processing. The main block demonstrates usage via print statements. All operations are static data handling with no external data input, network communication, or sensitive data processing. No signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static data definition and utility module for cityscape labels with no malicious or security risk indications. It contains no external data handling, network activity, or covert operations. Overall, the code appears safe and benign.",
