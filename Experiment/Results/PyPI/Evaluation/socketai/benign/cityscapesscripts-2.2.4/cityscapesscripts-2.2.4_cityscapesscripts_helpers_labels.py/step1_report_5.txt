  "purpose": "Define and manage labels and metadata for Cityscapes dataset for semantic segmentation tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the __main__ block for testing and demonstrations.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input data from __main__ triggers label lookups and display functions; no external or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated patterns detected. The code is straightforward and primarily for dataset label management.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a Label namedtuple with cityscape labels, including IDs, categories, colors, and other metadata. It creates lookup dictionaries for fast access by name, ID, and category. The function 'assureSingleInstanceName' processes label names to confirm if they represent individual instances, which is standard for label handling. The main block demonstrates label retrieval and display functions. No external data input, network activity, or malicious code is present. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code is structured for dataset management without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign dataset label management module with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It functions solely for organizing and accessing cityscape labels.",
