{
  "purpose": "This code provides locale-specific data and functionality for Hijri month and day names in multiple languages, supporting localization features.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the get_locale function (via the 'name' argument), and from class attributes such as 'month_names', 'gregorian_month_names', 'day_names', and 'language_tag'.",
  "sinks": "There are no clear sinks where untrusted data flows into critical operations or data leaks; the code primarily accesses internal data structures and raises ValueError for invalid input.",
  "flows": "Input from get_locale (locale name) flows to look up the locale class in _locale_map, then to instantiating and returning a Locale subclass. No dangerous data flows or transformations are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses standard patterns for localization with no obfuscated or suspicious language features. No hardcoded credentials or secret data are present. The dynamic registration of subclasses in __init_subclass__ could be considered unusual but is a common pattern for locale registration.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a global dictionary for locale registration, a get_locale function for retrieving locale objects, and a base Locale class with subclasses for specific languages. The subclasses set language-specific data for months and days. There are no external data sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or malicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of localization data structures with no malicious intent. It does not contain any suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The overall security risk is negligible.",
