  "purpose": "Define and retrieve locale-specific data for Hijri month and day names in multiple languages.",
  "sources": "Input locale name from function get_locale; class attribute definitions for locale data.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data is processed or written to external systems.",
  "flows": "Input from get_locale (locale name) -> mapping to locale class -> instantiation of locale object -> access to locale data via methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or backdoors. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious imports detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily establishes locale data classes with static lists for month and day names. The get_locale function retrieves locale classes based on a lowercased prefix of the input string. The class registry _locale_map enforces unique language tags via __init_subclass__ method. No external network, file I/O, or environment variable usage is present. No suspicious logic or malicious behaviors are detected. The code follows standard practices for locale data management and class registration, with no signs of malicious intent or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of locale data management for a calendar system, with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
