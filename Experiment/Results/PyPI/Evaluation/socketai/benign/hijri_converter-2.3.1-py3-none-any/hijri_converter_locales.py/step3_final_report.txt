{
  "purpose": "The code provides locale-specific data for month and day names in multiple languages, used for localization purposes.",
  "sources": "Static data within class variables for month and day names, and the get_locale() function that maps locale names to classes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static data is used, and no external input or output occurs.",
  "flows": "The get_locale() function retrieves locale classes based on input; locale methods access static lists for names.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses standard patterns for class registration and static data management.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of locale data classes with static, hardcoded strings. The get_locale() function maps locale identifiers to classes via a global registry. No dynamic code execution, external data fetching, or network activity is present. The class registration pattern is common and safe. No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious code are detected. The data is static and solely for localization, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static localization utility with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals indicate safety and correctness.",
