{
  "purpose": "The code provides locale-specific data for month and day names in various languages, primarily for localization of Hijri and Gregorian dates.",
  "sources": "Input data includes the locale name provided to get_locale(), which determines locale class instantiation.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that process untrusted data in a manner leading to data leakage or system compromise.",
  "flows": "Input from get_locale() is used to instantiate locale classes, which then supply localized month and day names via methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a mapping for locale classes and a factory function for retrieving locale instances. Each locale class supplies static data for names and notations. The __init_subclass__ method enforces unique language tags, which is standard. No dynamic code execution, external calls, or data handling from untrusted sources are present. All data is hardcoded; the code functions solely as a data provider without side effects or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of locale data for date localization. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It appears to be a benign localization utility with no indicators of supply chain attacks or malware.",
