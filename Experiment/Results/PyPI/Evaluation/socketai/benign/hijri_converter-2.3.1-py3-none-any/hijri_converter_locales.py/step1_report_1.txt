{
  "purpose": "The code provides locale-specific data and functionality for different languages, focusing on month and day names for Hijri and Gregorian calendars.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'name' parameter in the get_locale function; class attributes such as language_tag, month_names, gregorian_month_names, and day_names.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data outputs or network communications are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'name' in get_locale() -> lookup in _locale_map -> returns locale instance -> methods like month_name, gregorian_month_name, day_name used with trusted parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious dynamic code, no obfuscated or malicious code structures. The class registration via __init_subclass__ is standard for dynamic class registration.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a locale system with class-based data for different languages. The get_locale function converts a string input to a locale object, which then provides localized month and day names. The class registration uses __init_subclass__ to automatically populate _locale_map, which is standard Python metaprogramming. There are no signs of malicious code such as code injection, network activity, or data theft. The data stored within classes are static strings representing names; no dynamic code execution or external data fetching occurs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of locale data management with no evidence of malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious behavior. It appears safe and intended solely for localization purposes.",
