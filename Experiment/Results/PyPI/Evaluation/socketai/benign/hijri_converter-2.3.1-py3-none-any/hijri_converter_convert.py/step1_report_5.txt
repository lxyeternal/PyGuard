{
  "purpose": "Provides classes and methods for converting and manipulating Hijri and Gregorian dates, including validation and formatting.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from method parameters, such as date strings, integers, and locale strings.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is being used in dangerous operations or external communications.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., date strings, locale strings) flows through methods for parsing, validation, and formatting. No external data is sent or received over the network.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed. Usage of locale strings is standard; no malicious code evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines date handling classes with validation, formatting, and conversion functionalities. No code injection, network operations, or external data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The only inputs are method parameters such as date strings, locale tags, and date components, which are used locally within functions. The code employs standard libraries and external helper modules for date calculations and localization without evident malicious intent. No backdoors, hidden code, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The structure and logic are typical for date conversion libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a standard date conversion and formatting library with no malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain backdoors, data leaks, or external communications that could be harmful. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is very low.",
