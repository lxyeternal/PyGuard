{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes and methods for handling, validating, converting, and formatting dates in the Hijri and Gregorian calendars, supporting localization and date comparisons.",
  "sources": "Input data includes date parameters during object instantiation, ISO date strings, and locale strings for localization.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows are present; the code performs internal calculations and formatting without external data transmission.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (dates, locale strings) through validation and conversion methods, ending in formatted date strings or comparison results; no external or network flows are detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; external modules are assumed trusted but are external dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured date handling library for Hijri and Gregorian calendars, with proper validation, comparison, and formatting methods. It relies on external modules for calendar calculations and localization, which are typical for such libraries. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk (~0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's functionality and structure. External dependencies could be a concern if malicious, but within this code snippet, no issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure date handling module with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security flaws. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the minimal risk score reflects reliance on external modules but no active vulnerabilities.",
