{
  "purpose": "This module provides classes and methods for handling Hijri and Gregorian dates, including conversions and formatting.",
  "sources": "Reads data from external modules (hijri_converter.helpers, locales, ummalqura), system date/time, and user-provided date strings.",
  "sinks": "Outputs formatted date strings, locale-based names, and conversions; does not include network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Input data (date strings, locale tags, system date) flows into parsing, validation, and conversion methods; output is mostly formatted date info.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. Uses standard date and locale functions. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines date classes for Hijri and Gregorian calendars with validation, comparison, formatting, and conversion methods. It relies on external modules for locale support and calendar calculations. No malicious functions or network operations are present. The code does handle date parsing and conversion, but these are typical functionalities with no indication of malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are identified. The code appears well-structured for legitimate date handling, with standard practices followed. The use of external modules like 'helpers' and 'locales' should be reviewed for their security, but within this code snippet, no malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a date handling library for Hijri and Gregorian calendars. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected within this code segment. It performs standard date operations and conversions without any suspicious or harmful functionality.",
