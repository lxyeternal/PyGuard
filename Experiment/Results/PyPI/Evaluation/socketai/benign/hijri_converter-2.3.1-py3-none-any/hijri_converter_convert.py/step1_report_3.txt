{
  "purpose": "This code provides classes and methods for handling Hijri and Gregorian calendar dates, including conversions and formatting functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input parameters such as date strings, date objects, and locale settings. It also accesses external modules like 'ummalqura', 'helpers', and 'locales' for date calculations and localization.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that handle untrusted data in a manner that could lead to data leakage, command execution, or system compromise. It performs date calculations and formatting only.",
  "flows": "Input data (date strings, date objects, locale strings) flows into class constructors and methods, which process the data for conversions and formatting without transmitting untrusted data elsewhere. No data is sent over networks or written to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are present. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution is detected. The code follows standard date handling and formatting practices.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for Hijri and Gregorian dates with methods for comparison, conversion, and formatting. It uses external modules for calendar calculations and localization. The date validation checks ensure data integrity. No potentially malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, or malicious modifications, is evident. The code appears to be a standard implementation for calendar conversions and localization support.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured date conversion module with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It reads input data, performs standard calendar calculations, and formats output without any suspicious side effects.",
