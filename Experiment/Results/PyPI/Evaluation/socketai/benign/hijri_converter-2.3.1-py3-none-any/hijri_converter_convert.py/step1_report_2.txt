{
  "purpose": "This code provides classes and methods for handling Hijri and Gregorian calendar dates, including conversions between them and localization features.",
  "sources": "Reads from input parameters (dates, strings, locale tags), imported modules (helpers, locales, ummalqura).",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data is written to network, files, or external systems. No apparent data exfiltration or system modification functions.",
  "flows": "Input data (dates, strings, locale tags) processed through conversion and formatting functions. No external data flows or network interactions are observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. No dynamic code execution, suspicious variable names, or unusual logic. Use of locale and date conversions appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines date classes with methods for date validation, formatting, comparison, and conversion. No external network access, file I/O, or system commands are present. The locale functions and ummalqura constants seem to be for localization and calendar calculations, respectively. No malicious behaviors such as data theft, system compromise, or sabotage are detected. The code operates solely on date calculations and formatting within the scope of calendar conversions. It adheres to expected patterns without suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard date handling module focused on calendar conversions, localization, and date validation. No malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks are identified. It appears safe and consistent with normal date processing functions.",
