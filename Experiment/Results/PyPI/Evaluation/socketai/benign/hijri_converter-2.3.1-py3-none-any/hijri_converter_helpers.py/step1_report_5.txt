  "purpose": "Helper methods for converting between different date representations related to Julian Day Numbers and Hijri calendar calculations.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; all functions operate on parameters passed to them.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no data output besides return values from functions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function inputs (jdn, don, rjd) to their respective return calculations, with no external influence or side effects.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears straightforward, with simple arithmetic conversions; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for date conversions using arithmetic operations. Each function performs a basic calculation based on input parameters and returns the result. There are no external data reads, network communications, or manipulation of environment variables. No suspicious or malicious logic, backdoors, or malicious side effects are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of basic date conversion functions with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to serve a legitimate purpose related to date calculations for Hijri conversions.",
