  "purpose": "Helper methods for converting between different date formats used in Hijri calendar calculations, specifically Julian Day Number (JDN), Reduced Julian Day (RJD), and ordinal days.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions: jdn, don, rjd.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs, functions return converted date values.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into conversion functions, outputs are the calculated date values.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward mathematical conversion functions for date formats. Each function performs simple arithmetic operations with constants, with no external inputs, outputs, or side effects. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The functions are well-documented and implement standard conversions for date calculations related to Hijri calendar computations. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of helper functions for date conversion with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and functional for legitimate date conversions in Hijri calendar calculations.",
