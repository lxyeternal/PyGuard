  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting between Julian Day Number (JDN), Reduced Julian Day (RJD), and date ordinal numbers.",
  "sources": "Function parameters (jdn, don, rjd) used as input for calculations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; functions perform internal calculations only.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through arithmetic operations to produce converted date values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, well-documented, and free of suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code provides simple, deterministic date conversion functions using fixed constants. No external dependencies, network activity, or data leakage points are present. The functions perform standard calendar calculations, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The high confidence score (1) is justified given the clarity and simplicity of the implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code for date conversions with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
