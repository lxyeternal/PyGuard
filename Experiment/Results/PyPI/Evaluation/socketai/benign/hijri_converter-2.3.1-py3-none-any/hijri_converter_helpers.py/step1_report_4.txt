  "purpose": "Helper methods for converting between different date representations related to the Julian Day Number system, including JDN, RJD, and date ordinal.",
  "sources": "Function parameters such as jdn and don that accept input values.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted or external data; the functions perform straightforward mathematical conversions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (jdn, don, rjd) flow into calculations that produce converted date values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; functions perform basic arithmetic conversions without any unusual constructs or external data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple conversion functions with clear mathematical operations, no input validation or external data sources, and no side effects. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or malicious data flow. The functions are self-contained and only perform arithmetic transformations based on their inputs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward date conversion helper functions with no malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
