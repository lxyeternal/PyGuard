  "purpose": "Helper methods for converting between different calendar date formats, specifically Julian day number (JDN), Reduced Julian Day (RJD), and date ordinal numbers.",
  "sources": "Function arguments such as 'jdn', 'don', and 'rjd', which are input parameters for the conversion functions.",
  "sinks": "Return statements computing and returning converted date values; no data being written to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "Input parameters ('jdn', 'don', 'rjd') are used in simple arithmetic operations and then returned; no external data flows or manipulations beyond these calculations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual or suspicious code patterns, and no external network interactions observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines straightforward conversion functions using basic arithmetic operations, with clear and standard docstrings. There are no external inputs beyond function arguments, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious patterns. The functions perform simple, deterministic calculations related to calendar conversions, which are common in date handling modules. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of simple, standard conversion functions for date calculations. There are no malicious behaviors or security concerns identified in this module.",
