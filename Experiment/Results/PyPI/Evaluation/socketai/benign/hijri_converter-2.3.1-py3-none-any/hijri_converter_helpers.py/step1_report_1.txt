  "purpose": "Helper methods for converting dates between Julian Day Number (JDN), Reduced Julian Day (RJD), and date ordinal formats.",
  "sources": "Function arguments such as 'jdn', 'don', and 'rjd'.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the functions return calculated values based on inputs.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (jdn, don, rjd) are used in simple arithmetic operations to produce converted date formats.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed. The code performs straightforward mathematical conversions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines basic conversion functions for date representations, with clear documentation. There are no external inputs or outputs that interact with untrusted sources or external systems. No data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior is evident. Usage of simple arithmetic and no external library calls or dynamic code execution suggests no obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code consists solely of simple, well-documented date conversion functions with no malicious or suspicious elements. It appears to be utility code intended for date calculations without security risks.",
