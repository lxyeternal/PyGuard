  "purpose": "Provide conversion between Hijri and Gregorian dates based on the Umm al-Qura calendar.",
  "sources": "Import statement from hijri_converter.convert module.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis applicable as the code does not process input or data beyond imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is limited to a version declaration, a comment, and an import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains a docstring comment describing the package purpose and a version string. It imports specific classes from a third-party module, which appears standard. There are no hardcoded credentials, no data processing, and no suspicious code patterns. The import suggests dependencies on an external library, but that alone does not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation or hidden code present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal, benign module setup with a comment and an import statement. There is no malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks evident in this snippet.",
