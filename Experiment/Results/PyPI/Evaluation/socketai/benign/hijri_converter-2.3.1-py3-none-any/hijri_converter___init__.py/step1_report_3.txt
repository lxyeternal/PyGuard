{
  "purpose": "To provide conversion between Hijri and Gregorian dates using the Umm al-Qura calendar.",
  "sources": "Import from hijri_converter.convert module.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no untrusted data output or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; only imports and version assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version string, provides a descriptive comment, and imports two classes (Gregorian, Hijri) from an open-source library. There are no functions, user inputs, or data processing shown, and no external network communication or sensitive operations are present. The imported classes are from a publicly available package, which is not suspicious by itself. The code appears straightforward and standard for a date conversion utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module with metadata and an import statement from an open-source library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks in this snippet.",
