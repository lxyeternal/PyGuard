  "purpose": "Minimal module setup for Hijri-Gregorian date conversion based on the Umm al-Qura calendar.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'hijri_converter.convert'.",
  "sinks": "None in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "Import of external module; no data flow within the snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a descriptive comment, a version string, and an import statement. There are no functions, data processing, network calls, or other suspicious behaviors. The import relies on an external open-source library, which could be a supply chain concern if compromised, but the snippet itself is benign. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1, confidence=1) are consistent with this analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security threat. The reliance on an external library is a typical dependency and does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the supply chain risk is minimal, and the code is safe.",
