  "purpose": "Provide conversion between Hijri and Gregorian dates based on the Umm al-Qura calendar.",
  "sources": "Import statement from hijri_converter.convert module.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no data outputs or external connections within the provided code.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths observable in this snippet; only import and version assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code only sets a version string, provides a description, and imports specific functions/classes from an external module. There are no user inputs, network calls, or data processing visible. The imported module could contain potential risks, but nothing in this fragment indicates malicious activity. No obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, and no hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward setup for a date converter library with no signs of malicious intent or security risks within this fragment. The main concern would be the imported module, but based solely on this snippet, it seems benign.",
