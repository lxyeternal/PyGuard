  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scoring.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- The code snippets are minimal, consisting mainly of a descriptive comment, a version string, and an import statement from `hijri_converter.convert`.\n- No data processing, user input, network activity, or other potentially risky operations are visible.\n- The imported module (`hijri_converter.convert`) is an external open-source dependency, which could have its own risks, but nothing in the snippet indicates malicious behavior.\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code appears benign with no malicious or security issues, which aligns with the minimal code shown.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the issues in the code:\n- The code is just a comment, version, and import statement. There are no actual functions, data flows, or logic to analyze.\n- **No issues are present in the code snippet itself.**\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in the reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. They correctly identify that the code is benign and minimal.\n- They emphasize reliance on an external module but do not attribute any malicious behavior to it.\n- No flawed reasoning or logical mistakes are evident.\n\n### Scoring review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code. No signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Security risk score:** Mostly 0 or very low (0.1), which is reasonable. Since the code is minimal and only imports an external library, the risk is negligible.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- Since there's no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk, scores above 0.5 are unjustified.\n- The only potential concern is the external dependency, but without further code or context, it cannot be deemed malicious.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the code snippet and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks evident)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- If we had access to the `hijri_converter` package itself, a deeper review could be warranted, but based solely on this snippet, the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is minimal, transparent, and does not exhibit any malicious or risky behavior. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain as they are.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign nature of the provided code snippet.",
