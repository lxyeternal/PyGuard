  "purpose": "Provides conversion between Hijri and Gregorian dates based on the Umm al-Qura calendar, likely as part of a larger package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'hijri_converter.convert' module.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no data processing, network, or file operations are visible.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink flow detected, as the code only imports modules and sets a version string.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; the code is minimal, straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated parts.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a description comment, a version variable, and a single import statement. The import suggests reliance on an external module, but no malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The code is standard for a library module setup, with no network activity, data leaks, or malicious instructions present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a simple part of a date conversion library. No malicious intent or security risks are detected based on the provided snippet.",
