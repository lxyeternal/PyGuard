  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the details provided and cross-referencing with the code.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as static constants related to calendar calculations, with no input/output, network activity, or dynamic behavior.\n- The large list of month start days appears to be precomputed calendar data, not obfuscated or malicious code.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident.\n- The code is purely data-driven, with well-documented constants and ranges.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n\n- **Code correctness:**  \n  The code defines date ranges, an offset, and a large tuple of integers representing month start days. These are consistent with calendar calculation data, and there are no signs of incorrect data or malicious modifications.\n\n- **Malicious behavior:**  \n  No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The data appears to be standard precomputed calendar constants.\n\n- **Obfuscation:**  \n  The code is straightforward, with clear comments and type annotations. No obfuscated code patterns or suspicious constructs.\n\n- **Scores consistency:**  \n  All reports assign malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, and securityRisk = 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Report 1-5:**  \n- Purpose: Define calendar constants and date ranges.  \n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Static constants, no external data or output.  \n- Anomalies: None detected; large dataset is typical for calendar data.  \n- Analysis: No malicious behavior, just data definitions.  \n- Conclusion: Benign, legitimate calendar constants.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- securityRisk: 0 (appropriate)  \n\nAll are reasonable given the data.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:**  \n- **Should be 0.** No signs of malicious code or payloads.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**  \n- **Should be 0.** The code is transparent and well-documented.\n\n**Risk score:**  \n- **Should be 0.** No security risks identified.\n\n**Additional notes:**  \n- The large static dataset is typical for calendar implementations and does not indicate malicious intent.  \n- The code's purpose is purely to serve as configuration/constants for calendar calculations.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type        | Recommended Value | Justification                                              |\n|-------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0                   | No malicious behavior detected.                              |\n| Obfuscated        | 0                   | Clear, straightforward data definitions.                     |\n| Security Risk     | 0                   | No vulnerabilities or risky behaviors present.               |\n\n---\n\n**Final verdict:**  \nThe code is a benign, static configuration module for calendar calculations, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores given in the reports are accurate and reasonable.\n\n**Note:** I will update my own estimate as follows:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the evidence from the code.",
