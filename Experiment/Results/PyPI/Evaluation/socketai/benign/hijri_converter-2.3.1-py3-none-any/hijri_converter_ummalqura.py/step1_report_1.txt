  "purpose": "Defines calendar constants and date ranges for Umm al-Qura calendar calculations.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; static constants are used, including date ranges and month start days.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points; no data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; all data is predefined constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The large array of constants is standard for calendar calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes date ranges for Gregorian and Hijri calendars, and precomputes start points of months in a fixed sequence. No dynamic or malicious behavior is evident. There are no functions, input/output operations, or external interactions. The constants are straightforward calendar data used for date conversions. The size and structure of the month starts list suggest it is a precomputed table for calendar calculations, not malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static configuration module for calendar constants. It contains no malicious behavior or sabotage indicators. It appears to be a legitimate part of a calendar calculation library, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data leaks.",
