  "purpose": "Defines static constants for the Umm al-Qura calendar, including date ranges, an offset, and a large lookup table of month start days in Reduced Julian Day format.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from predefined constants and large static tuples; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "Static data is used directly for calendar calculations; no dynamic flows or data transformations are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the data appears to be precomputed calendar constants with standard structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely static, defining constants and large lookup tables for calendar calculations. There are no functions, external data handling, or dynamic code execution. The data appears legitimate and typical for calendar support libraries. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration module for calendar constants, with no malicious intent or security issues. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are justified and consistent with the code content.",
  "model": "gpt-4.1-nano"
