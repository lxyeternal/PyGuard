  "purpose": "Define constants and data for Umm al-Qura calendar calculations, including date ranges and month start days.",
  "sources": "Type hints from typing module, constant definitions for date ranges, offsets, and month start days.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input sources or data sinks present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines static data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. The large list of month start days appears to be precomputed calendar data, not generated or fetched dynamically. No obfuscation, obfuscated code, or suspicious language features present.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines constants related to the Umm al-Qura calendar, including date ranges for Gregorian and Hijri calendars, an offset value, and an extensive list of month start days in RJD (Reduced Julian Day). All data is static and precomputed. There are no inputs, no outputs, no network activity, and no dynamic code execution. The constants appear consistent with calendar data, and there are no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign set of static calendar data constants used for calendar calculations. There are no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. The code is well-structured and purely data-driven.",
