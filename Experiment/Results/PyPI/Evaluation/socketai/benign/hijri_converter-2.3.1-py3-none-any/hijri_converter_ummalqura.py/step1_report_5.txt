{
  "purpose": "Define constants and data structures related to Umm al-Qura calendar calculations, including date ranges and month start points.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it defines static constants and data structures.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources or sinks; the code is purely static data definition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The extensive list of month start days appears to be precomputed calendar data; no code execution or dynamic behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of type aliases, date range constants, an offset calculation, and a large tuple of precomputed month start days. All data is static and well-structured, with no input/output operations, network activity, or code execution. The purpose is to support calendar calculations for supported date ranges. No malicious or obfuscated code features are detected; the data appears to be standard calendar constants for Umm al-Qura calendar implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static configuration module defining calendar constants for date ranges and month start days. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities are present. It is a straightforward data setup for calendar calculations.",
