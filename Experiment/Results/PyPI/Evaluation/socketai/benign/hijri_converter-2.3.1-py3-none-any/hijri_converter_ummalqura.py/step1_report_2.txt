{
  "purpose": "Define constants and data structures for Umm al-Qura calendar conversions, including date ranges and month start days.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads input or external data; all data are predefined constants and type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not handle untrusted data or perform data output that could be exploited.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static constants are used for calculations or calendar support.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious functions. The data lists and constants are straightforward and well-structured. No embedded network calls or system commands are present.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines constants and data structures related to date ranges and month start calculations for the Islamic calendar. There are no functions, external data inputs, or execution logic that could be exploited. The constants appear to serve the purpose of calendar conversions, and the large static list of month start dates is consistent with calendar data, not malicious obfuscation or behavior. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely informational and data-driven, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It defines calendar constants for date conversions without any harmful logic or external interactions.",
