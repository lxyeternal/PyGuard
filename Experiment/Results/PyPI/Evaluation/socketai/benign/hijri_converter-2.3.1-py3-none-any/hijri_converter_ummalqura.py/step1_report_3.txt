{
  "purpose": "Define constants and data structures for Umm al-Qura calendar calculations, including date ranges and month start days.",
  "sources": "Type annotations, string comments, and constant definitions; no input or data reading operations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no data output or network operations.",
  "flows": "N/A – static constant definitions without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The large tuple of integers appears to be precomputed calendar data, with no indication of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines date ranges for Gregorian and Hijri calendars, a Hijri offset, and a large tuple of integers representing month start days in Reduced Julian Day format. These constants are typical for calendar calculations and are statically defined, with no dynamic code execution, user input, or network activity. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The comments clarify purpose and data nature. The data appears to be precomputed calendar constants, likely legitimate for calendar conversion purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward declaration of calendar constants with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not perform any input/output, network operations, or obfuscated code. The large dataset is consistent with precomputed calendar data, not malicious payloads.",
