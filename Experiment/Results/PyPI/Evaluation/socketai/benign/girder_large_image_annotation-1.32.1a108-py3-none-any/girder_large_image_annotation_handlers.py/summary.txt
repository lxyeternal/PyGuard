  "conclusion": "The code is a typical backend module for managing annotations, with no signs of malware or malicious sabotage. The low malware score (0) and obfuscation score (0) are appropriate. The slightly elevated risk score (~0.2-0.3) reflects operational concerns like large file handling and untrusted data processing but does not indicate malicious intent."
