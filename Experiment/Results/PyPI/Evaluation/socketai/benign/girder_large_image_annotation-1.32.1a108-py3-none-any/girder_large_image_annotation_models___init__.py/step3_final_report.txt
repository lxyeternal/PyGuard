  "purpose": "Analysis of suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, and malicious patterns in the provided Python code snippets or descriptions.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, hardcoded strings, dynamic execution functions ('exec()', 'eval()'), import statements, control flow constructs.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file operations, subprocess/system calls, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user input flow into sinks like network or file operations, often via dynamic execution or obfuscated code segments.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded credentials, obfuscated variable names, use of 'exec()' or 'eval()', suspicious import patterns, complex control flows, suspicious hardcoded strings.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits patterns typical of obfuscated or potentially malicious scripts, including dynamic execution functions and obfuscation indicators. Reports with no code correctly assign zero scores. Reports mentioning suspicious patterns justify high suspicion scores. Slightly increasing the malware suspicion in Report 4 from 0.4 to approximately 0.55-0.6 better aligns with the described behaviors. Overall, the scores are consistent with the evidence and suspicion levels.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports accurately reflect the security posture based on the described patterns. Minor adjustments, especially increasing the malware score in Report 4 to around 0.55-0.6, improve alignment with the suspicious behaviors. The overall assessment indicates moderate suspicion with some reports showing high risk, warranting cautious handling.",
