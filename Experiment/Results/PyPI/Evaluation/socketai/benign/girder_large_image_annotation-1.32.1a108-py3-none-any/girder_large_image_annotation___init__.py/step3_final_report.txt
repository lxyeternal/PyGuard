{
  "purpose": "This code implements a Girder plugin for large image annotations, handling registration, validation, event binding, and search mode configuration.",
  "sources": "Import statements for Girder modules, importlib.metadata for version info, local modules for models and handlers, and external library girder_large_image within a handler.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows into sensitive operations; no external network calls or data exfiltration; no hardcoded secrets or credentials.",
  "flows": "Version info fetched via importlib.metadata; event handlers and search modes interact with local data; no external data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns; dynamic import within a handler is benign; code structure is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Girder plugin setup, registering models, setting defaults, validating settings, binding event handlers, and configuring search modes. The use of importlib.metadata is safe, with exception handling. No external network activity or untrusted data handling is present. The code does not contain obfuscation or malicious payloads. All functions and registrations follow typical patterns, and no suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured Girder plugin for large image annotations, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is very low (~0.1), consistent with the analysis.",
