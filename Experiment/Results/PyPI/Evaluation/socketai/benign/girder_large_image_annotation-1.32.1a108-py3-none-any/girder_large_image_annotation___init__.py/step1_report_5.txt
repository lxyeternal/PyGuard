{
  "purpose": "The code initializes a Girder plugin for large image annotations, including setup for models, API endpoints, settings validation, static content, and event handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements, especially importlib.metadata for version info, girder modules, local models, and handlers.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks where untrusted data flows into critical operations; configuration and model registration are safe.",
  "flows": "Data flows mainly involve configuration and setup, with no untrusted user input processed directly into sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code; only standard plugin setup procedures observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and registers plugin models, settings, and event handlers in a typical manner. It includes validation for boolean settings and sets defaults securely. The version handling accounts for missing packages. Static content registration and API extensions are standard. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. All code appears to be straightforward plugin initialization without suspicious behaviors or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Girder plugin setup with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks identified. It appears safe and legitimate for its intended purpose.",
