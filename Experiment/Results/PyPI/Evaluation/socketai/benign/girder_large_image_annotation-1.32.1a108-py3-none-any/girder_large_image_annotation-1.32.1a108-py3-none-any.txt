      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured Girder plugin for large image annotations, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is very low (~0.1), consistent with the analysis."

      "conclusion": "The code is a typical backend module for managing annotations, with no signs of malware or malicious sabotage. The low malware score (0) and obfuscation score (0) are appropriate. The slightly elevated risk score (~0.2-0.3) reflects operational concerns like large file handling and untrusted data processing but does not indicate malicious intent."

It follows best practices and maintains a clear, readable structure. The security risk is minimal, and malware likelihood is negligible."

The risk score should reflect the potential for exploitation if untrusted files are loaded, but overall, the code appears benign."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured annotation management system with no indicators of malicious activity or sabotage. The override patterns, while unusual, are used purposefully for version control. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation are present. Overall, supply chain security is maintained, and the code is safe for use."

      "conclusion": "Most reports accurately reflect the security posture based on the described patterns. Minor adjustments, especially increasing the malware score in Report 4 to around 0.55-0.6, improve alignment with the suspicious behaviors. The overall assessment indicates moderate suspicion with some reports showing high risk, warranting cautious handling."
