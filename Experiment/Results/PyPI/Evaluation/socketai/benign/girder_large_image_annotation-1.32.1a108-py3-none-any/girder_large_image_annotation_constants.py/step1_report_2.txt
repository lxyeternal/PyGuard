  "purpose": "Define and set plugin configuration constants for a large image plugin within the Girder framework.",
  "sources": "Import from girder_large_image.constants and access to PluginSettings.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code only assigns string constants.",
  "flows": "Import of constants -> assignment to PluginSettings property -> definition of annotation flag variable.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific constant class from a Girder plugin, then sets a configuration parameter. It also defines a string flag. There are no input/output operations, no user data handling, nor network or file system interactions. The code appears to be straightforward configuration setup without any dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple configuration assignment for a plugin, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears to be standard setup code.",
