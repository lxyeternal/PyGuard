  "sources": "Import statement from girder_large_image.constants",
  "sinks": "Assignment to PluginSettings.LARGE_IMAGE_ANNOTATION_HISTORY and creation of ANNOTATION_ACCESS_FLAG",
  "flows": "Import -> Setting constants in PluginSettings",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a constants module and assigns string values to plugin configuration variables. It appears to define settings related to annotation history and access flags. There are no external inputs, network calls, or sensitive data handling. The code is straightforward, lacks obfuscation, and does not perform any operations beyond setting constants.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple configuration setup for a plugin, with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be benign and purely declarative.",
