  "purpose": "Define configuration constants for the 'large_image' plugin, specifically for annotation history and access flags.",
  "sources": "Import from 'girder_large_image.constants' module; assign string constants to class attributes.",
  "sinks": "None; static assignment of constants, no data input or output.",
  "flows": "Import statement followed by direct attribute assignments; no dynamic data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static configuration code, no obfuscation, secrets, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from an external module and assigns string constants to its attributes. It performs no input/output, network activity, or dynamic execution. The code is purely configuration, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores as zero. The logic is simple and standard for setting plugin parameters, with no vulnerabilities or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration setup with no security concerns or malicious activity. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
