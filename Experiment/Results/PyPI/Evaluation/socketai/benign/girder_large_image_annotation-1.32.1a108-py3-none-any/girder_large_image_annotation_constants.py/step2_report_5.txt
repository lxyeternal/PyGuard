  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checkting the code, reasoning, and scores.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code snippets are straightforward configuration constants, importing from an external module and assigning string values to class attributes.\n- No input/output, data processing, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are evident.\n- All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues or vulnerabilities are present in the code snippets.\n- **Errors or flaws in the report's logic:** The reports are consistent, logical, and accurate in their assessment.\n\n### Score analysis:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign configuration code.\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The reports do not overstate or understate the risk; they correctly interpret the code as configuration setup with no security implications.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, which is justified.\n- No changes are necessary for the scores.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- Since the code is purely configuration, there's no reason to suspect hidden malicious intent.\n- The consistent, straightforward assignment of string constants is typical for plugin setup.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nBased on the provided code and reports, I agree with the current scores and assessments. The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current evaluations and is justified by the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior.",
