  "purpose": "Define constants for plugin settings and annotation access flags within the 'girder_large_image' module.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'PluginSettings' from 'girder_large_image.constants'. Assignment of string values to module-level constants.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code only performs static assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists of straightforward constant definitions and a simple attribute assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from an external library and assigns a string constant to an attribute of that class. There are no user inputs, no dynamic code execution, no sensitive data handling, and no network operations. The assignment appears to be configuration setup. No obfuscation, malicious logic, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign configuration code snippet setting constants related to large image annotation history and access flags. No malicious activity, no suspicious behavior, and no security issues identified.",
