  "flows": "Import -> Assign to PluginSettings attribute",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple assignment of a string constant; no input/output or untrusted data handling",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific class from an external module and assigns a string value to a class attribute. There is no input, output, or data processing; the code only sets a configuration constant. No data leaks, no malicious code, and no suspicious behavior are present. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and serves a configuration purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign configuration code snippet setting a constant for plugin behavior. No malicious intent, no suspicious activity, and no security risks identified.",
