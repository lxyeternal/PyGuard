{
  "purpose": "To evaluate the security posture of the open source dependency by analyzing code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks, ensuring scores are consistent with findings.",
  "sources": "Input data, external modules or inputs (if any), code snippets (if provided).",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network connections, or execution points where untrusted data could cause harm.",
  "flows": "Data flow from sources (inputs) to sinks (outputs or critical functions), including any suspicious or anomalous pathways.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, unusual control flow, or suspicious patterns not typical of benign code.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets are minimal or not provided; all reports consistently describe benign, straightforward code with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation. Malware scores are zero across all reports, aligning with the absence of malicious activity. Security risk scores are low (0.1-0.2), reflecting a cautious but benign assessment. Confidence levels are high where code is analyzed, and no anomalies or suspicious behaviors are identified. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the descriptions. No evidence suggests malicious intent or supply chain compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no detected malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores are justified and consistent with the analysis. Maintaining low risk and malware scores is appropriate; no adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
