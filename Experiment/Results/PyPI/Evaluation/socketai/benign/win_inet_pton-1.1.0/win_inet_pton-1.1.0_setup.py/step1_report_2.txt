{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for packaging and distributing the Python module 'win_inet_pton'.",
  "sources": "Reading README.rst and LICENSE files for long description and license information; static data in setup() parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or environment variable manipulation beyond reading static files.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading static files into the setup() function parameters; no untrusted data input to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns detected. The code uses standard setup tools without dynamic execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python package setup script. It imports 'io' for reading files and 'setuptools' for packaging. The setup() call specifies package metadata, including name, version, author info, description, and classifiers. Files like README.rst and LICENSE are read into strings for description and license info, which is a common practice. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as network activity, code injection, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. Usage of standard libraries and conventional setup practices suggest this is legitimate package configuration code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It reads static files for documentation purposes and properly configures package metadata. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present.",
