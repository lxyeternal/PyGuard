  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the Python module 'win_inet_pton'.",
  "sources": "Static files 'README.rst' and 'LICENSE' read via io.open().",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; only static file reading and setup() call.",
  "flows": "Reading static files -> passing data to setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward package configuration with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that imports 'io' and 'setuptools', reads static documentation files, and calls setup() with package metadata. It contains no dynamic inputs, network activity, code execution, or obfuscation. The code is well-structured, standard, and benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly identify it as safe, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0. The overall assessment is that the code is safe and poses no threat.",
