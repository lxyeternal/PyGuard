  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution; usage of standard setup tools and file reading methods.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script utilizing setuptools to configure package metadata and description. It reads local files 'README.rst' and 'LICENSE' for long description and license info, respectively. There is no input validation, external data fetching, or dynamic code execution. All functions and methods used are standard and do not introduce security concerns. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected. The script appears to be a typical setup configuration for a Python package.",
