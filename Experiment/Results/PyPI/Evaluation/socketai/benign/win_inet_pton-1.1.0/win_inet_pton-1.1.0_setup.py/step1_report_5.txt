  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'win_inet_pton' Python module.",
  "sources": "io.open() calls for reading README.rst and LICENSE files, metadata definitions, and package configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potential data leaks are present in this setup script.",
  "flows": "Reading files via io.open() and passing static metadata to setup(); no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets; standard setup procedure.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, reads documentation and license files using io.open(), and calls setuptools.setup() with static, hardcoded metadata. There are no user inputs, network calls, or dynamic data processing that could lead to malicious behavior. The code structure follows typical Python packaging conventions without anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
