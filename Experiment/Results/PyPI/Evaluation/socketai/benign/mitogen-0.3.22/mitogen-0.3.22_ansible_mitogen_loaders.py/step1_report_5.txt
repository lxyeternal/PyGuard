{
  "purpose": "The code manages compatibility checks for different Ansible versions and loads specific plugin modules accordingly.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current Ansible version from 'ansible_mitogen.utils.ansible_version'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; it does not process untrusted data for harmful effects.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves version info, performs version comparisons, raises exceptions if incompatible, and imports plugin loaders.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns. The code consists of standard version check and import logic, with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious activities.",
  "analysis": "The script defines version constraints and checks the running environment's Ansible version against these constraints, raising errors if unsupported. It then imports various plugin loader modules from Ansible. The only data flow involves reading a version tuple, comparing it, and conditionally raising errors. No data is sent over the network, processed insecurely, or manipulated maliciously. The code is straightforward, intended for compatibility management, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility check and plugin loader setup for Ansible and Mitogen, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and intentionally designed for environment validation and module importing.",
