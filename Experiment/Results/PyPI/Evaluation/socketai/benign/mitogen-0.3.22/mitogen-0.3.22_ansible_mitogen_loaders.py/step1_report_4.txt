  "purpose": "This code manages compatibility checks for different Ansible versions and loads specific plugins based on the version support, with no apparent malicious intent.",
  "sources": "ansible_mitogen.utils.ansible_version, ansible.errors, imported modules, and plugin loader functions",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data processing that could lead to data leakage or malicious actions",
  "flows": "Version information from ansible_mitogen.utils.ansible_version is checked against supported ranges, and based on that, plugin loaders are used without modifying or transmitting untrusted data",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code performs standard version checking and plugin importing, with proper exception handling for unsupported versions",
  "analysis": "The script performs version validation for compatibility between Ansible and Mitogen, raising errors if the version is unsupported. It imports plugin loaders and preserves original methods for future use. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code includes only standard version control, exception handling, and module imports. No hardcoded credentials, data leaks, or malicious network activity are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard compatibility and plugin loading script for Ansible with Mitogen, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain security threats. It performs legitimate version checks and plugin imports, following best practices for error handling.",
