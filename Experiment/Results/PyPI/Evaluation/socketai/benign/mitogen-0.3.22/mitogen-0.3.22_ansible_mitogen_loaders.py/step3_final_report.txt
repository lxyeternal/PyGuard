  "purpose": "Performs version validation for ansible_mitogen.utils.ansible_version and loads plugin loader functions from ansible.plugins.loader to ensure compatibility across Ansible versions.",
  "sources": "Reads ansible_mitogen.utils.ansible_version attribute for version info.",
  "sinks": "Raises ansible.errors.AnsibleError if version unsupported.",
  "flows": "Checks version, then raises error or proceeds to import plugin loaders.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code validates the Ansible version against predefined bounds, raising descriptive errors if unsupported. It imports plugin loader functions safely and stores references for later use. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted data processing is present. The logic is straightforward, relying on trusted attributes. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are evident. The version validation could potentially disrupt workflows if misused, but this is standard practice and not a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard compatibility utility for plugin management in Ansible, with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The minimal security risk score (0.1) is appropriate, primarily reflecting potential operational disruption if version validation fails, but not a security threat.",
