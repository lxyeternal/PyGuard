{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to parse UNIX hashbang (shebang) lines and script interpreter paths from source strings, typically for interpreting or processing script execution directives.",
  "sources": "The source strings provided to `parse_hashbang` and `parse_script_interpreter`, which are byte strings representing script lines.",
  "sinks": "The output of the parsing functions, which could influence script execution or interpretation logic downstream.",
  "flows": "Input source string -> parse_hashbang or parse_script_interpreter -> interpreted interpreter and argument tuple",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no malicious code, no obfuscated code, no network activity, and no suspicious external calls detected. The functions perform straightforward string parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly parses shebang lines and interpreter paths from input byte strings, returning interpreted text components. It uses safe string operations and relies on simple, well-understood parsing logic. The functions include checks to ensure proper shebang syntax. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious payloads. No external network, system modifications, or obfuscation mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for parsing UNIX hashbang lines and does not contain any malicious or security-compromising behavior. It functions purely as a string parser with no external dependencies or harmful operations.",
