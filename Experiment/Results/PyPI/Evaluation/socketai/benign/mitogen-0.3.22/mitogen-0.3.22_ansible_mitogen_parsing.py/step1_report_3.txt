{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to parse UNIX hashbang (shebang) lines to extract the interpreter and optional argument from script files.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the 'source' parameter, which is expected to be a string representing the first line of a script file (the shebang line).",
  "sinks": "The code does not write untrusted data to external systems or perform any sensitive data leaks or effects. It only processes input strings locally.",
  "flows": "Input 'source' is passed to 'parse_hashbang', which checks for the shebang prefix and then passes a substring to 'parse_script_interpreter'. This function processes the data locally without external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. The functions operate purely for parsing purposes. No obfuscated code or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily provides utility functions for parsing shebang lines in scripts, by splitting the line into interpreter and argument components. It includes checks for the shebang prefix and newline characters. Uses mitogen.core.to_text for text conversion, which is typical for processing such data. No data leakage, external communication, or suspicious behavior detected. Functions perform standard string operations and assume input is a script line. No signs of malicious intent or malicious code flow are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for parsing shebang lines in scripts. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a standard, safe implementation.",
