{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to parse UNIX hashbang lines and extract the script interpreter and its argument.",
  "sources": "Reads the input string 'source' in the functions 'parse_script_interpreter' and 'parse_hashbang'.",
  "sinks": "Returns processed strings; no direct sinks that could lead to data leaks or execution vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "flows": "Input 'source' -> 'parse_hashbang' (checks for shebang) -> 'parse_script_interpreter' (parses interpreter and argument) -> output tuple.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior. Uses benign string operations. No external data, network activity, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code safely processes string inputs to parse hashbang lines and interpreters. It uses standard string operations, including find, split, and strip, to extract parts. It does not execute or evaluate the input strings, nor does it contain any malicious or suspicious logic. The code relies on the 'mitogen.core' module for text conversion, which is a legitimate dependency. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior observed. Overall, the code performs straightforward parsing without security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for parsing hashbang lines and script interpreters. It is well-structured, secure, and free of malicious intent or suspicious activity. No security risks identified.",
