{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to parse UNIX hashbang (shebang) lines to extract the interpreter and its argument.",
  "sources": "The code reads the input string `source`, which should contain the hashbang line or script interpreter string.",
  "sinks": "The code processes input data to produce a tuple of interpreter and argument; there are no direct sinks that lead to data leaks or system compromise.",
  "flows": "Input string `source` is analyzed to locate newline characters or hashbang prefixes, then split and convert parts into text, returning interpreter and optional argument.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious logic are present. The code mainly performs string parsing with no external network or file system operations.",
  "analysis": "The functions parse hashbang lines by detecting the '#!' prefix, extracting interpreter and argument segments, and converting byte strings to text using mitogen.core.to_text. The logic is straightforward, focusing on string manipulation without any external calls or potentially malicious operations. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security concerns are evident. The code does not execute untrusted input or access sensitive data; it strictly performs parsing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for parsing UNIX hashbang lines to identify interpreters. It contains no malicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, and does not pose any security risks. It appears to be a utility function with a clear and safe purpose.",
