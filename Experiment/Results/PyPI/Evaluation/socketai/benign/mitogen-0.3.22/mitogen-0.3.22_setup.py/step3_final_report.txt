{
  "purpose": "Standard setup.py script for the 'mitogen' Python package, reading version info and README for package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'mitogen/__init__.py' and long description from 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, network activity, or external inputs processed.",
  "flows": "Static file reads and version extraction without dynamic or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Uses Python 2 shebang and syntax; no obfuscation or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional package setup script, with safe use of 'ast.literal_eval' and no malicious or suspicious behavior. The use of deprecated Python 2 syntax is noted but not malicious. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted input handling is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign nature, though the risk could be slightly lower given the lack of risky operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal security risk score is appropriate, and the overall assessment confirms no malicious intent or behavior.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
