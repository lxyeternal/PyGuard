{
  "purpose": "Define exception classes for structured HTTP error responses within the Connexion framework.",
  "sources": "Imports from jsonschema.exceptions, starlette.exceptions, and internal modules; class constructors and attributes.",
  "sinks": "Attributes set during exception instantiation; calls to the 'problem' function to generate response payloads.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor parameters into class attributes, then into the 'problem' function to produce error responses.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from base exception classes, setting attributes like status, title, detail, and providing a method to generate problem responses. There is no dynamic code, external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation. The structure is straightforward and standard for error handling in web frameworks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes for HTTP error responses. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
