{
  "purpose": "Define exception classes for HTTP error handling within the Connexion framework, facilitating structured error responses.",
  "sources": "Imports from jsonschema.exceptions, starlette.exceptions, and internal modules; class constructors and methods; string formatting for error details.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted input could be passed to error details or headers, but there are no explicit untrusted data flows; no network or file output is directly observed.",
  "flows": "No dynamic execution or untrusted data flows from sources to sinks are present; error details are set via parameters or default strings.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation. Class inheritance and error handling follow standard patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines exception classes with no data input handling or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded credentials, network operations, or cryptic constructs are present. The string formatting in error messages uses static strings and parameters, with no evident injection vectors. The class constructors set error details and headers, but do not process external untrusted data. The import statements are standard and do not hint at malicious behavior. Overall, the code appears to be straightforward, well-structured exception definitions intended for predictable error handling within the framework.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard exception class definitions for HTTP error handling, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It serves as part of a framework to generate proper error responses without any malicious intent.",
