  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the presence of issues, their reasoning, and the appropriateness of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines exception classes for HTTP error handling; no untrusted data flows, no malicious behavior observed.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Analysis:** The report correctly identifies that the code is solely class definitions for error handling, with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** The malware score is appropriate. The risk score of 0 is justified, given the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n**Recommendation:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, the code defines custom exceptions for error responses, with no suspicious patterns or malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Analysis:** The reasoning is sound; the code is straightforward, with no dynamic or unsafe data handling.\n- **Conclusion:** The malware score and security risk are appropriately set to zero.\n\n**Recommendation:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, exception classes for HTTP errors, with no malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Analysis:** The report confirms the code is purely class definitions with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** The malware and security risk scores are justified.\n\n**Recommendation:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with detailed reasoning indicating no suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Analysis:** The report notes no dynamic code, external data, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** The malware score appears appropriate; the security risk score is minimal.\n\n**Recommendation:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as others—standard exception class definitions with no malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious behaviors, no code injection, no obfuscated logic.\n- **Conclusion:** Malware and security risk scores are justified.\n\n**Recommendation:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity, assigning a score of 0.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk scores:** Given the code's nature as simple exception class definitions with no external or dynamic behavior, a low risk score (~0.0 to 0.1) is justified.\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 to 0.1, reflecting the benign and standard nature of the code.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard, well-structured set of exception classes with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n**Note:** No further action or concern is necessary based on these reports.",
