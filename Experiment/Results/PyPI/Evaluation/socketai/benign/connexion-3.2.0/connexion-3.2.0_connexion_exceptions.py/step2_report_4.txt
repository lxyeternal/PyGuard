  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical flaws, or malicious indicators.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines exception classes for error handling, imports are standard.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No dynamic data flow or untrusted input handling; error details are set via parameters.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is straightforward class definitions for structured error responses. No malicious or obfuscated code, no external network or file operations.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Both are zero.\n- **Verdict:** Safe, standard exception class definitions.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar observations as Report 1, with emphasis on the purpose of defining custom exceptions for HTTP errors.\n- No suspicious patterns, no dynamic code execution, no data leaks.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Zero.\n- **Verdict:** Benign, standard error class definitions.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on defining exception classes with attributes and a method to generate problem responses.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscation.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Zero.\n- **Verdict:** Safe, well-structured exception classes.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar to previous reports, detailed class hierarchy for error handling.\n- No suspicious patterns, no external data handling, no obfuscation.\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9) but still no concerns.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Zero.\n- **Verdict:** Safe, standard implementation.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Consistent with previous analyses, defining exception classes with no malicious patterns.\n- No network calls, no obfuscated code, no secrets.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Zero.\n- **Verdict:** Safe and benign.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Code presence of issues:** None. All reports describe standard exception class definitions.\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:** None observed.\n- **Scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, risk):** All zero or very close to zero, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n- **Justification for higher risk scores:** Not applicable; no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:** None. The code is purely structural, with no data processing or external interactions that could be exploited.\n\n### Final conclusion:\nThe code is a clean, standard set of exception class definitions intended for structured error handling in a web framework. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security vulnerabilities or risky behaviors)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the detailed analysis.",
