  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, potential security implications, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It defines a set of custom exception classes for handling HTTP errors within the Connexion framework.\n- The classes inherit from Python's built-in exceptions, starlette's HTTPException, and internal classes.\n- They mainly set attributes like status, title, detail, and generate problem responses via a `problem()` function.\n- No dynamic code execution, input processing, or external data handling is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Define exception classes for HTTP error handling.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious behaviors; straightforward class definitions.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n- **Verdict:** The report correctly assesses that the code is benign, with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Custom exceptions for handling HTTP errors.\n- **Analysis:** Similar to Report 1; standard pattern, no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Verdict:** Accurate; no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Define custom exception classes.\n- **Analysis:** Same as above; no malicious code, no data leaks, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Verdict:** Correct assessment.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Exception classes for HTTP errors.\n- **Analysis:** Same observations; no malicious patterns, no dynamic code, no secrets.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (very low, primarily because of the general caution)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 (slightly less than perfect, but still confident)\n- **Verdict:** The minor security risk score is appropriate given the lack of malicious content; the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Define custom exception classes.\n- **Analysis:** Consistent with previous; no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code, with scores of 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports are clear, straightforward, and un-obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** Since the code is purely defining exception classes with no dynamic or external data handling, the risk score should be very low, close to 0.\n\n### Final recommendation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThe reports are consistent with the code's nature. They are thorough and correctly identify that this code is benign, serving as part of a framework's error handling mechanism.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a standard, well-structured set of exception class definitions for error handling within a web framework. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The provided reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is purely for exception handling and response formatting, with no malicious or security-compromising elements.",
