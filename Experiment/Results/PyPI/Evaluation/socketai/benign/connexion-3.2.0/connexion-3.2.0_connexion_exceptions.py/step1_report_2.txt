  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling HTTP errors and validation issues within the Connexion framework.",
  "sources": "Import statements for jsonschema.exceptions.ValidationError, starlette.exceptions.HTTPException, and internal problem module.",
  "sinks": "The exception classes' constructors and methods which set HTTP status codes, titles, details, and generate problem responses.",
  "flows": "Exceptions are raised during various error conditions, with data flowing from input parameters into exception attributes and the to_problem() method, which calls the problem() function.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns observed. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. The code primarily consists of exception class definitions with standard patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines numerous exception classes inheriting from Python built-in exceptions and framework-specific classes, used for generating HTTP error responses. There is careful handling of error details and status codes. The constructors set attributes based on parameters, and the to_problem() method prepares a structured response. The code is straightforward, lacks dynamic code execution, external data fetching, or network communication, and does not contain any malicious logic or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of custom exceptions for a web framework, with no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. It focuses solely on defining error classes and their behaviors. Overall, the code appears safe and benign.",
