  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the details provided and the potential security implications.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Define exception classes for HTTP error handling.\n- Sources: Standard imports; class constructors and methods.\n- Sinks: Potentially untrusted input could be passed to error details or headers, but no explicit untrusted data flows are present.\n- Flows: Data flows from parameters into exception attributes; no dynamic code execution.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n- Analysis: The code is straightforward class definitions for structured error responses, with no malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Safe, benign, standard exception class definitions.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Custom exception classes for HTTP errors.\n- Sources: Imports from jsonschema and starlette, plus internal modules.\n- Sinks: Exception constructors and the to_problem() method.\n- Flows: Data from parameters to exception attributes, then to the problem() function.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- Analysis: Similar to Report 1, purely defining exception classes for error handling.\n- Conclusion: No malicious activity, safe and standard.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Exception classes for HTTP errors.\n- Sources: Imports from jsonschema and starlette, class initializers.\n- Sinks: Calls to the problem() function, setting attributes.\n- Flows: Parameters to attributes, then to error responses.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious patterns, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- Analysis: Straightforward class hierarchy for error handling, no dynamic or malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: No signs of malicious code.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Define exception classes for HTTP and application errors.\n- Sources: Imports, class constructors.\n- Sinks: Calls to the problem() function, error response creation.\n- Flows: Data flow from exception instantiation to response generation.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- Analysis: Standard pattern for error classes; no malicious intent.\n- Conclusion: Safe, benign code.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1 (very low, likely due to minor uncertainties, but nothing suspicious)\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Custom exception classes for HTTP errors.\n- Sources: Imports, class constructors.\n- Sinks: Calls to the problem() function.\n- Flows: Data flows from exception parameters to response payloads.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious patterns, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- Analysis: Typical error class definitions, no malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Clearly safe.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Code Content:** All reports describe standard exception class definitions for a web framework, with no dynamic code, external data handling, or network activity.\n- **Malware Risk:** The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code content.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation detected; all code is straightforward.\n- **Security Risks:** Very minimal, mostly related to the potential for untrusted data being passed into error details, but no actual flows or vulnerabilities are present.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is purely structural, defining exception classes for error handling.\n- No malicious logic, backdoors, secrets, or obfuscation are present.\n- The use of the `problem()` function appears to be a standard way to generate structured error responses.\n- The security risk is negligible, and the malware score is appropriately zero.\n\n### Suggested scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior observed)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk beyond standard error handling)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a safe, standard implementation of exception classes for a web framework, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
