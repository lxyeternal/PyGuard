{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for the Connexion framework to generate HTTP responses with specific error information.",
  "sources": "Import statements; class constructors; methods that handle error details and generate responses.",
  "sinks": "Methods that call the 'problem' function with error details; the 'to_problem' method that creates a response object.",
  "flows": "Exception instantiation → setting attributes → 'to_problem' method calling 'problem' with attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. No dynamic code execution or external network calls observed. Use of exception classes and structured error info appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of exception classes for HTTP errors within the Connexion framework, with constructors setting error details and converting to problem responses. No input sources or untrusted data flows are evident within this module. The code does not perform network operations, file manipulations, or any behavior that could be malicious. The pattern of defining exceptions and transforming them into response payloads is typical and safe. No obfuscated code, secret keys, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, safe implementation of custom exception classes for handling HTTP errors. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are detected. The module solely defines error classes and response formatting logic.",
