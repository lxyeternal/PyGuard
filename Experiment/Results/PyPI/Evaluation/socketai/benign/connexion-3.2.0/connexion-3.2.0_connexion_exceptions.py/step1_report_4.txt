{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various HTTP and application errors in the Connexion framework.",
  "sources": "Imports from jsonschema.exceptions, starlette.exceptions, and local .problem module; class definitions and __init__ methods.",
  "sinks": "Instantiation of exception classes, invocation of the 'problem' function, setting of attributes like status, title, detail, type, instance, headers, ext.",
  "flows": "Exception instantiation -> attribute setting -> to_problem() method calling 'problem' function with parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors; use of standard exception classes and straightforward attribute handling; no dynamic code execution or data leaks observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured hierarchy of exception classes tailored for HTTP and application errors, including client and server error classes. It imports necessary modules and defines exception classes with appropriate constructors. The 'ProblemException' class and its subclasses handle error details and generate problem responses via the 'problem' function. No data input/output handling, no use of environment variables, no code injection or obfuscated logic, and no network calls or system modifications are present. The code appears to serve as a standard error-handling framework without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exceptions for error handling in a web framework. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The design is consistent with best practices for exception handling and response generation.",
