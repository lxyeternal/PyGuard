{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various HTTP errors and application-specific errors within the Connexion framework.",
  "sources": "Import statements for jsonschema.exceptions.ValidationError and starlette.exceptions.HTTPException; class initializers and methods that assign parameters and call external functions.",
  "sinks": "Methods like to_problem() calling the problem() function; class constructors setting attributes; exception handling logic.",
  "flows": "Exceptions are instantiated with parameters, some of which are passed to the problem() function or set as attributes; the to_problem() method creates a problem response based on instance data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data handling observed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious network activity. The code strictly defines exception classes and their initialization logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward definition of custom exception classes inheriting from base exceptions, with attributes set during initialization. The to_problem() method calls an external problem() function, likely to generate standardized error responses. No data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior is evident. No suspicious input handling or untrusted data flows are apparent. All exception classes serve to structure error responses and do not contain malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of exception class definitions for error handling in a web framework. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The absence of network calls, dynamic code execution, or secret handling indicates no malicious intent or security threats.",
