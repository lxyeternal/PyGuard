  "purpose": "Define constants related to the HTTP protocol for use in other modules.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; all data is hardcoded constants.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow points; no untrusted data handling or external data output.",
  "flows": "No data flows; code only defines static data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of static constants with no dynamic or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static definitions of content types, methods, and HTTP status codes, with no input/output handling, no dynamic code execution, and no embedded code that could be malicious. It serves as a constants module for HTTP-related data, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign set of constant definitions related to the HTTP protocol. It poses no security threat or malware risk.",
