{
  "purpose": "This module defines static constants related to the HTTP protocol, including content types, methods, and status codes.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; static definitions within the code.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or data.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code contains only constant definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and static with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static data structures defining HTTP-related constants. There are no dynamic behaviors, input/output handling, or embedded code that could be malicious. The absence of obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious constructs indicates a benign purpose. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, aligning with the static and harmless nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static constants module for HTTP protocol definitions with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
