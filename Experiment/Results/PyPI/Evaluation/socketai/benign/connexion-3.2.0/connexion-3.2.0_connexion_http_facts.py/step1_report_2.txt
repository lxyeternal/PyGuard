{
  "purpose": "Defines constants related to the HTTP protocol, such as content types, methods, and status codes.",
  "sources": "Constants are hardcoded in the module; no data input or external sources are read.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs present in this code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines static data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected. The data structures are standard and static.",
  "analysis": "The module only contains static definitions of HTTP-related constants, including lists and dictionaries. There are no dynamic operations, no user inputs, no external data processing, and no code execution based on external data. The constants serve as reference data for other parts of an application.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward set of static constants defining HTTP protocol parameters. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. The module’s purpose is purely informational and does not involve any potentially malicious activities.",
