  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and evaluate their conclusions, scores, and any potential issues.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is static, contains only constants, and has no dynamic or external data handling.\n- The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The malware score is consistently 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The security risk scores are also 0, which seems appropriate given the static nature of the code.\n\n**Detailed review:**\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly identifies that the code is static constants related to HTTP.\n- **Potential issues:** None. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, securityRisk 0.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly states that constants are hardcoded, with no external input or dynamic behavior.\n- **Potential issues:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, securityRisk 0.  \n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Properly notes that the code is static, with no functions or dynamic code.\n- **Potential issues:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, securityRisk 0.  \n**Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly identifies static definitions with no suspicious patterns.\n- **Potential issues:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, securityRisk 0.  \n**Verdict:** Sound.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Accurately describes the code as static constants serving as a reference module.\n- **Potential issues:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, securityRisk 0.  \n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, which is correct. The code contains no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation (0).\n- **Risk score:** Since the code is purely static constants with no dynamic or external data handling, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n**However,** considering the nature of this code, which is just a constants module for HTTP protocol definitions, it is inherently low risk. There are no vulnerabilities, no malicious activity, and no obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my evaluation:**\n\n| Metric            | Final Score | Justification                                                                 |\n|-------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0            | No malicious code, no suspicious behavior.                                   |\n| Obfuscated        | 0            | Clear, static definitions; no obfuscation detected.                         |\n| Security Risk     | 0            | Static constants with no external or dynamic data; no security issues.     |\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. The code is benign, static, and poses no security threat.\n\n**My final estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis provided and confirms the benign nature of the code.",
