  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code in question is a module defining static constants related to HTTP protocol (content types, methods, status codes).\n- All reports agree that the code is static, straightforward, and contains no dynamic or suspicious constructs.\n- No external data sources, no input/output handling, no code execution, no obfuscation, and no signs of malicious behavior are present.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code matches the original code provided.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or embedded malicious code are evident.\n   - The data structures are standard and serve as reference constants.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is static and benign.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to issues:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the static nature and lack of malicious activity.\n   - Security risk scores are also 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - The confidence levels are high (1), which is justified.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all evidence points to benign static data, there's no reason to assign a higher risk score.\n   - The scores are consistent and justified.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - No malicious behavior is indicated or implied.\n   - The malware score of 0 across all reports is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities or exploits are made; the reports are purely descriptive.\n   - The analysis correctly dismisses any potential concerns without unwarranted assumptions.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the analysis provided.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Final evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a benign constants module with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. The reports are accurate and consistent. No changes to scores or conclusions are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the provided assessments and the code's nature.",
