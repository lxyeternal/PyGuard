  "purpose": "Defines constants related to the HTTP protocol, including content types, methods, and status codes.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs that process untrusted data or perform side effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths; the code only defines static data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static definitions: a list, a set, and a dictionary related to HTTP protocol constants. There are no functions, input/output operations, or dynamic behaviors that could be exploited. The data appears to be standard, well-structured, and relevant to HTTP protocol handling. No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, static definition of HTTP constants with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
