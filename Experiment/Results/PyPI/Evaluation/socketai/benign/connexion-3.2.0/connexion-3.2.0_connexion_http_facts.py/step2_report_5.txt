  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code in question is purely static, defining constants related to HTTP protocols: content types, methods, and status codes.\n- All reports agree that there are no dynamic elements, input/output handling, or suspicious constructs.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or vulnerabilities are present.\n- The purpose appears to be purely informational or as a constants module for use elsewhere.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   - The code is straightforward and static; no issues are present.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports' logic:**  \n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their reasoning; no errors detected.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to issues:**  \n   - All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the static, benign nature of the code.\n   - Obfuscated score is 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n\n4. **Justification for higher risk scores:**  \n   - No reason to increase risk scores; the code is benign.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   - The malware score is correctly set to 0 across all reports, reflecting no malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as static constants.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**My own evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll reports are accurate and thorough. The code is a benign constants module with no security concerns. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:**\n\n- The code is safe, and the scoring reflects that.\n- No further action required.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, static set of HTTP constants with no malicious or risky elements. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.",
