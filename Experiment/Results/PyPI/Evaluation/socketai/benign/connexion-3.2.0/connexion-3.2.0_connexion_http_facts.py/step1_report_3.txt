{
  "purpose": "Defines constants related to the HTTP protocol, including content types, methods, and status codes.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading; static definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing; purely static data definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow or processing occurs, as the code only contains constant definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of static variable and dictionary definitions related to HTTP protocol standards. There are no functions, input handling, data processing, or external interactions. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity are present. The constants appear to be standard and widely used in HTTP implementations. The code structure is straightforward, with no unusual patterns or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign, containing only static protocol constants. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
