  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical consistency, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard configuration module for Swagger UI and OpenAPI specs, with no malicious intent or security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is purely configuration, with no signs of malicious activity. The scores seem appropriate; no changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, confirming benign configuration code with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable. No issues detected.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Same as above; configuration code with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate; no changes necessary.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Also describes a straightforward configuration module, with no malicious activity. Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.1), justified by the mention of potential configuration exposure.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** The securityRisk score is slightly elevated but still low, reflecting the minimal risk from configuration code. This seems reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Similar benign configuration code, with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** The securityRisk score again is low but non-zero, which is acceptable given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, which is correct; the code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports, justified by the potential exposure of configuration paths and warnings, but overall very low.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- The code is a standard configuration setup with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis.\n- No modifications are necessary.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Security risk score:** 0.05 to 0.1 (very low, mainly due to configuration exposure warnings)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, well-structured, and intended for configuration purposes only. The reports and scores are appropriate.",
