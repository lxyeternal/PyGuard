  "purpose": "Define configuration options for Swagger UI in a Connexion application.",
  "sources": "Imports (swagger_ui_bundle, dataclasses, logging, typing), environment or package dependencies, class attributes, and properties that may be set or read during runtime.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the properties that output configuration paths and settings, but no data sinks or untrusted outputs are explicitly present in this code.",
  "flows": "Configuration options are set during instantiation and retrieved via properties; no flow involves processing untrusted input into sensitive actions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated language, or hardcoded secrets. The code handles optional dependencies gracefully. No suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines configuration data classes and a class to manage Swagger UI options. It includes conditional logic for the OpenAPI specification path based on version, handles missing dependencies gracefully, and logs warnings if the Swagger UI template directory is not found. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious operations or backdoors. The code appears straightforward, well-structured, and intended solely for configuration management.",
  "conclusion": "This module serves as a configuration utility for Swagger UI in a Connexion application. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The code is standard and secure, with no signs of malware or supply chain attacks.",
