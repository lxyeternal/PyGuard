  "purpose": "Define configuration options and classes for serving Swagger UI and OpenAPI specifications within a Connexion application.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class constructors, property methods, and module-level variables such as NO_UI_MSG.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no direct data leakage, insecure evaluations, or untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "N/A - No evident flow of untrusted input to critical functions or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code uses standard library features and conditional imports without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily establishes configuration classes for Swagger UI, with safe default values and proper input validation for the options object. It includes a conditional import that assigns None if the module is missing, and logs a warning if the Swagger UI directory isn't found. The code contains no external data handling, no command execution, no network calls, and no manipulation of environment variables. The class constructors and properties are straightforward, serving configuration data without executing untrusted code or performing dangerous operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration setup for Swagger UI integration within a Python application. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, malicious intent, or security risks based on the provided code fragment.",
