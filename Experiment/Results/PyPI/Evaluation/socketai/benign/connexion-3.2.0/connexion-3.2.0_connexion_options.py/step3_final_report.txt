{
  "purpose": "This code defines configuration classes and options for integrating Swagger UI and OpenAPI specifications within a Python application, facilitating UI serving and customization.",
  "sources": "The code reads optional dependencies (swagger_ui_bundle), configuration parameters from class instances, and logs warnings when dependencies or directories are missing.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data, execute commands, or perform network operations; the code only accesses configuration attributes and logs warnings.",
  "flows": "The flow involves setting configuration options, optionally importing dependencies, and providing properties to access configuration values; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The only notable anomaly is the warning message about missing swagger_ui directory, which is benign and standard in optional dependency handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward configuration module for Swagger UI integration, with optional dependency import, class-based options, and properties for accessing configuration parameters. No external data processing, command execution, or malicious patterns are present. The warning about missing directories is benign. The code's structure and content indicate a benign, standard setup with no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard configuration module for Swagger UI and OpenAPI specs, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are consistent with this assessment, with malware score at 0, obfuscation at 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1) due to optional dependencies and warnings, which are benign.",
