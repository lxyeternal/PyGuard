  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's actual content, potential security implications, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard configuration module for Swagger UI and OpenAPI specs, with no malicious intent or security risks.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — configuration code with no security impact.\n- **Assessment:** The report is accurate. The code only handles configuration, with no external command execution, data exfiltration, or malicious logic.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines benign configuration options, attempts to import a UI bundle, logs warnings if the directory isn't found. No malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — clear code.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — purely configuration.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No suspicious patterns or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to above, safe configuration setup with no malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — correct.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** Valid. No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Configuration utility with version-based spec path, handles optional dependencies, logs warnings. No malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.1 — slightly higher, but still negligible; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal; mostly configuration with a warning.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score might be justified by the warning log, but overall, it's still a benign configuration module.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others; handles configuration, logs warnings, no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — acceptable given the warning, but no real security risk.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- **Code Behavior:** All reports correctly identify that the code is purely for configuration, with no execution of untrusted code, no network activity, or data manipulation.\n- **Malware and Obfuscation:** All scores are appropriate; no obfuscation or malware is present.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly above zero in some reports due to warning logs, but these are benign.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security Risk Score:** **0.1** — very low, related to configuration warnings, not actual vulnerabilities.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, safe configuration module for Swagger UI integration in a Python web application. No malicious or supply chain security issues are evident.",
