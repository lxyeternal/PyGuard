  "purpose": "Defines configuration classes and options for serving Swagger UI and OpenAPI specifications in a web application.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class constructors, property methods, and conditional assignments",
  "sinks": "None detected; code primarily handles configuration without executing external commands or executing untrusted data",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from class instances to properties used for serving UI and API specs, no external untrusted input flows into sensitive sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns are observed. The code performs standard configuration handling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports external modules, sets default paths, and defines data classes for configuration options. It includes a warning message for missing UI directory, which is standard practice. The class 'SwaggerUIConfig' initializes with options and sets spec paths based on OAS version, with validation of input types. Properties provide access to configuration parameters, with no dynamic execution, external commands, or suspicious behavior. Overall, it appears as a standard configuration module with no malicious or suspicious code behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration setup for Swagger UI and OpenAPI specs, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe and intended for normal application use.",
