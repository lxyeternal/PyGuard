  "purpose": "Define configuration options for serving Swagger UI and OpenAPI specifications in a Connexion application.",
  "sources": "Imports (dataclasses, logging, typing, optional import of swagger_ui_path), class constructors, property methods, and constants.",
  "sinks": "Logging warnings, potentially returning configurable file paths, and exposing configuration dictionaries.",
  "flows": "Configuration objects created, properties accessed for serving paths and options, logging triggered when UI templates are missing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no code injection, no suspicious network activity, no backdoors or malicious data leaks. The use of optional imports and default configuration settings is typical for such modules.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data classes and configuration logic for Swagger UI in a Connexion application, including optional imports, property accessors, and validation checks. There is a warning logged when the Swagger UI template directory is not found, but this is standard for configuration validation. No malicious or suspicious behavior such as code injection, data theft, or backdoors is detected. The use of external configuration, optional imports, and dynamic property resolution appears safe and intended for flexible deployment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration module with no signs of malicious intent. It facilitates serving Swagger UI and OpenAPI specs, handles missing dependencies gracefully, and issues warnings when necessary. No malicious or security-compromising behavior is present.",
