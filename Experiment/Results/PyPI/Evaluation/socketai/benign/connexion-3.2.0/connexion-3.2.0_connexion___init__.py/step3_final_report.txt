{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a setup module for the Connexion framework, importing core components, handling optional dependencies (such as Flask support), and assigning variables accordingly.",
  "sources": "Static import statements, try-except block for optional 'connexion.apps.flask' dependency",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, no external network calls, no data leaks or execution of untrusted code",
  "flows": "Import statements and exception handling do not involve data flow from untrusted sources; no runtime data flow present",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard import and dependency handling, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup module that imports necessary components and manages optional dependencies via try-except. It does not process user input, execute dynamic code, or perform network operations. The exception handling for missing dependencies is standard practice. No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious behavior is evident. All signals indicate benign, standard framework setup code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, benign, and typical for a Python framework setup. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The assigned malware score is 0, security risk score is 0, and confidence is high.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
