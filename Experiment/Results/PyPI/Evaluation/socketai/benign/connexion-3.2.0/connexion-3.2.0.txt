      "conclusion": "The code is a benign mock resolver used for testing API endpoints. No malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks are present. The potential concern about overriding operation.example_response() is outside the scope of this code's control and typical usage. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."

      "obfuscated": 0,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is generally standard and well-structured for schema validation, with no active malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the unsafe use of yaml.load() without specifying a safe loader, which could lead to remote code execution if untrusted YAML input is processed. Addressing this by explicitly using yaml.safe_load() or passing the loader parameter would mitigate this risk. The malware score remains at 0, but the security risk should be elevated to approximately 0.5 to reflect this vulnerability."

      "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard configuration module for Swagger UI and OpenAPI specs, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are consistent with this assessment, with malware score at 0, obfuscation at 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1) due to optional dependencies and warnings, which are benign."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate CLI tool for server setup with no malicious intent. The primary security consideration is the handling of user-supplied paths and dynamic imports, which could be exploited if inputs are malicious. However, given the controlled approach, the risk remains low. The assessments and scores across reports are accurate and aligned with the code's behavior."

      "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, safe implementation for generating API problem detail responses. No malicious or obfuscated elements are present. The minor risk associated with untrusted data can be mitigated externally. The existing security scores are appropriate; I recommend maintaining malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a conservative risk score of 0.1 to 0.2. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk and functions as intended."
