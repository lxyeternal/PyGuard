{
  "purpose": "This code defines a MockResolver class used to resolve API operations by returning mock functions, mainly for testing or development purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'operation', 'operation_id', 'self.mock_all', and method parameters.",
  "sinks": "Returns functions that execute 'operation.example_response()' which may generate responses; no external data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input 'operation' is used to generate or resolve an operation ID, which then determines whether a mock or resolved function is returned; the mock_operation method calls 'operation.example_response()' to generate a response.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external connections; code uses standard libraries and patterns; no obfuscated code or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a mock resolver class for API operations, resolving either to a mock function or a specific function from an operation ID. It handles operation resolution errors gracefully and provides default responses when no example response is defined. The code uses standard Python features, proper exception handling, and logging. There are no signs of malicious behavior, external data exfiltration, or backdoors. It operates solely within the scope of API response mocking, with no external network or system modification activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign mocking utility used for testing API operations. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. No security risks or malware indicators are evident.",
