{
  "purpose": "This module provides a mock resolver class for testing or development purposes, returning mock functions for unresolved operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads operation objects passed to the resolve() method, and calls operation.example_response() within mock_operation().",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks for untrusted data; the code does not write to external systems or handle untrusted input in a way that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "The resolve() method determines whether to resolve an operation or generate a mock; it then constructs a function that calls mock_operation(), which calls operation.example_response().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. The code relies on external libraries (connexion) but does not perform suspicious actions like network connections or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a mock resolver for API operations, primarily used in testing. It constructs mock functions and handles resolution logic with standard error handling. The only potentially risky aspect is the dynamic creation of mock functions, but this is benign in this context. There are no indications of data leakage, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The code's purpose is limited to providing mock responses and does not interact with external systems or sensitive data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign mocking utility designed for testing API operations. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It simply provides mock responses when resolution fails or is configured to do so.",
