  "conclusion": "The code is a benign mock resolver used for testing API endpoints. No malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks are present. The potential concern about overriding operation.example_response() is outside the scope of this code's control and typical usage. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
