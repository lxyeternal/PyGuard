  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate CLI tool for server setup with no malicious intent. The primary security consideration is the handling of user-supplied paths and dynamic imports, which could be exploited if inputs are malicious. However, given the controlled approach, the risk remains low. The assessments and scores across reports are accurate and aligned with the code's behavior."
