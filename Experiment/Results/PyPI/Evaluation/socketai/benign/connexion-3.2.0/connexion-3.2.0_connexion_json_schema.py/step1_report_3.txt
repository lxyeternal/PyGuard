  "purpose": "This module provides utilities for resolving JSON schema references, extending YAML loading, and validating JSON schemas, primarily for schema validation purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include files via file URI scheme, URLs via http/https, and JSON/YAML data loaded from these sources. It reads external schemas and references.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are the YAML and JSON data structures after resolution, where data could be processed or validated. The code itself does not write or send data elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Sources (file URLs, HTTP URLs, input data) are loaded via handlers, then references are resolved recursively, updating the main spec object. Validation functions process data but do not send or store data externally.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not contain suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. It performs standard reference resolution and schema validation. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard JSON schema reference resolution using custom handlers for 'file' and 'http' schemes, with support for deep reference resolution. It extends YAML loaders to ensure JSON compatibility, provides mechanisms for nullable validation, and includes a function for formatting validation errors. All functions perform typical data handling, with no signs of malicious payloads, network exfiltration, or backdoors. The network calls are limited to fetching external schema references, which is typical for schema validation systems. There are no suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, system manipulation, or hidden code pathways. The code appears secure and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for JSON schema validation with external reference resolution. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. Its purpose is to load, resolve, and validate schemas securely. No evidence suggests malicious intent or security threats.",
