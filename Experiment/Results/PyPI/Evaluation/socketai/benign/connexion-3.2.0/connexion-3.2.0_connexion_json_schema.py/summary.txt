  "conclusion": "The code is generally standard and well-structured for schema validation, with no active malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the unsafe use of yaml.load() without specifying a safe loader, which could lead to remote code execution if untrusted YAML input is processed. Addressing this by explicitly using yaml.safe_load() or passing the loader parameter would mitigate this risk. The malware score remains at 0, but the security risk should be elevated to approximately 0.5 to reflect this vulnerability."
