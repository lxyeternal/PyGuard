{
  "purpose": "Provides a function to generate HTTP problem detail responses in JSON format for error reporting.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to the 'problem' function: status, title, detail, type, instance, headers, ext.",
  "sinks": "json.dumps() serialization of the problem_response object; returning ConnexionResponse object.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are assembled into a dictionary, which is then serialized and returned as a response.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic content in 'ext' and 'instance' without validation; no evident malicious code, but potential for injection if inputs are untrusted.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a dictionary for problem details, allowing optional extension with 'ext' and optional 'instance'. It imports a local class 'ConnexionResponse' from a relative module. The serialization via json.dumps() is standard and secure if inputs are sanitized. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors observed. The only potential concern is if input parameters are maliciously crafted; however, as a response generator, it does not process untrusted data internally beyond serialization.\n\nOverall, the code is a standard implementation for creating HTTP error responses with no evidence of malicious intent or malware. It does not perform any network operations, data theft, or backdoors. It is a utility function that safely constructs a JSON response object.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for creating problem detail responses and does not contain malicious behavior. No security risks or malware indications are present, and it operates as a typical response formatting function.",
