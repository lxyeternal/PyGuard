  "purpose": "Provides an interface to generate HTTP API problem detail responses in JSON format",
  "sources": "Input parameters to the problem() function: status, title, detail, type, instance, headers, ext",
  "sinks": "json.dumps() for JSON serialization, returning ConnexionResponse object",
  "flows": "Function parameters -> problem_response dict -> json.dumps() -> ConnexionResponse return",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscated elements; the only internal import is for a response class",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to generate standardized error responses for HTTP APIs. It takes various parameters to customize the problem detail. The only potentially sensitive operation is json.dumps(), which serializes the response dictionary. The imported class ConnexionResponse is used to return the response, but without its implementation, we can't assess if it introduces risks. The code does not execute any untrusted input directly, nor does it contain malicious behaviors such as network connections, data leaks, or backdoors. The code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured implementation of an API error response generator.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for API error responses with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs serialization and response generation safely without suspicious behavior.",
