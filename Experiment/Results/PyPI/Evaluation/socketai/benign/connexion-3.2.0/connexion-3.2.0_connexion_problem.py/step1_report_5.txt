  "purpose": "Provides a function to generate HTTP problem detail error responses conforming to a standard format.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to the 'problem' function: status, title, detail, type, instance, headers, ext.",
  "sinks": "json.dumps used for serializing the problem response; ConnexionResponse object creation with various parameters.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are assembled into a dictionary, then serialized with json.dumps, and used in creating a ConnexionResponse object.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious network calls, no dynamic code execution, and no unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that constructs an error response following a standard format. It imports a class from a local module, uses input parameters to build a dictionary, and serializes it into JSON for response. The function handles optional parameters safely and does not perform any unsafe operations or suspicious data handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of an error response generator with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply constructs a standardized error message with configurable details.",
