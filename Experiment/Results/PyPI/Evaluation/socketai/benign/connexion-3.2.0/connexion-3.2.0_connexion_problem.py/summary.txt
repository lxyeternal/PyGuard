  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, safe implementation for generating API problem detail responses. No malicious or obfuscated elements are present. The minor risk associated with untrusted data can be mitigated externally. The existing security scores are appropriate; I recommend maintaining malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a conservative risk score of 0.1 to 0.2. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk and functions as intended."
