  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, the only import is for response handling, and the code is straightforward.\n- **Security assessment:** JSON serialization is safe here; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 seems reasonable given the simplicity; the low risk score reflects minimal concern.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, aligns with the code.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Potential concern about untrusted data in 'ext', 'instance', 'type' being directly inserted into the response and serialized.\n- **Security assessment:** While the code does not sanitize inputs, this is a common pattern; the risk is primarily if inputs are malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 still reasonable; no malware or obfuscation detected.\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is sound; no malicious behavior but potential for injection if inputs are untrusted.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous, no malicious code, no secrets, standard implementation.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.0—appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity, safe serialization, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1—reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, standard implementation, no issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0—appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n- **Risk scores:** Mostly low (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal security concern. The only slightly higher risk (0.2) in reports 1 and 2 is justifiable due to potential injection if untrusted data is used without validation, which is a common concern in such utility functions.\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malware detected or implied.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — 0.2, considering potential injection if inputs are malicious, but overall low.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent and reasonable. The code is a standard, safe implementation of an API error response generator, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. Proper input validation should be recommended if used with untrusted data, but that does not change the security assessment here.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the scores as they are, or adjust the risk slightly higher if emphasizing the importance of input validation, but overall, the current scores are appropriate.",
