  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** The code is straightforward, generating a problem detail response. No suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation. The only operation is `json.dumps()` on a dictionary assembled from input parameters. The imported class `ConnexionResponse` is from a local module, and its implementation isn't provided, but there's no indication of malicious behavior.  \n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, which aligns with the analysis.  \n- **Assessment:** No issues found. The code appears safe and standard.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with additional emphasis on potential injection if untrusted data is passed via `ext`, `instance`, or `type`. The import of `ConnexionResponse` is noted as unusual but not malicious. The serialization is standard.  \n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, which seems reasonable given the context. The potential concern about untrusted data is acknowledged but not considered a security risk inherent to the code itself.  \n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior; just a note on input validation.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Same general structure, no malicious code, no secrets, no obfuscation. The function is a utility for generating error responses.  \n- **Scores:** Both 0, consistent with the analysis.  \n- **Assessment:** Safe and standard.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports, with emphasis on safe practices and no suspicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Both 0, appropriate.  \n- **Assessment:** No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as above, standard implementation, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Both 0, appropriate.  \n- **Assessment:** Safe.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no indication of malicious activity, backdoors, or malware.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, and the code is clear, well-structured, and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code—a utility function for generating API error responses—the risk is minimal. The only potential concern is if untrusted data is passed via parameters like `ext`, but this is typical and not inherently dangerous. The scores of 0.2 in some reports seem slightly high; a more conservative and justified value would be closer to 0.1 or even 0, considering the code's purpose and implementation.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Adjust scores:**  \n  - **Malware:** 0 (correct)  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 (correct)  \n  - **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 is acceptable, but given the code's simplicity and safety, I would set it to **0.1** for a conservative estimate.\n\n- **Security assessment:**  \n  - No malicious code or malware detected.  \n  - The code is a standard, safe utility function for API error responses.  \n  - Proper input validation should be recommended if untrusted data is used in production.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a safe, standard implementation with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The existing scores are reasonable, but I suggest lowering the risk score slightly to reflect the minimal inherent risk.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
