  "purpose": "Provides a function to generate HTTP API problem detail responses following a standard format.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to the 'problem' function: status, title, detail, type, instance, headers, ext",
  "sinks": "json.dumps() serialization, returning ConnexionResponse object with headers and body",
  "flows": "Function parameters (sources) are used to construct a dictionary, then serialized and returned as a response",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no code injection, no system modification, no external network calls, no suspicious data leaks or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily constructs a standardized error response. It imports a class from a local module, avoids dangerous operations, and uses standard JSON serialization. The 'type' parameter defaults to 'about:blank' if not provided. No dynamic code execution, no secret handling, and no obfuscated or malicious code structures are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation for generating standardized problem detail responses in an API. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
