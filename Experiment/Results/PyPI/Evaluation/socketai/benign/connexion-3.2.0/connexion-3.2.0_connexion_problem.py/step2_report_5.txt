  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a straightforward implementation of an API error response generator. No suspicious or malicious code, secrets, or obfuscation. The only operation is `json.dumps()` on a constructed dictionary, which is safe.\n- **Malware score:** 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2, perhaps due to potential injection if untrusted data is passed via 'ext' or other parameters, but overall minimal.\n- **Assessment:** The report's reasoning is sound; no issues detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on potential risks if untrusted data is included in 'ext' or other parameters. The import of `ConnexionResponse` is within the function, which is unusual but not malicious.\n- **Malware score:** 0, consistent.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2, acknowledging potential injection if inputs are malicious, but this is typical for such utility functions.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior, just a standard response generator.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Clear, straightforward, no suspicious activity or obfuscation. Uses standard practices.\n- **Malware score:** 0, consistent.\n- **Security risk:** 0, no issues.\n- **Assessment:** Safe, standard implementation.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports, no malicious activity, just a utility function. The only concern is unvalidated input in 'ext' and other parameters, which is typical.\n- **Malware score:** 0, aligned.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1, very low.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious intent, just standard practice.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, no suspicious code or obfuscation, standard implementation.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** Safe.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of malware:** No, all reports agree that the code is a simple utility for generating error responses.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Risk scores:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The only minor concern is the inclusion of untrusted data in 'ext' or other parameters, which could lead to injection if used improperly. However, this is a common pattern and not indicative of malicious intent.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — minimal, mainly due to potential injection if inputs are untrusted, but not a security flaw inherent in the code itself.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, safe implementation of an API error response generator with no malicious or obfuscated elements. Proper input validation should be employed when integrating this code into larger systems, but the code itself is secure.",
