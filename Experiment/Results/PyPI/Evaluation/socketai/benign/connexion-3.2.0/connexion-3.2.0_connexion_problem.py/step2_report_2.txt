  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the potential security implications, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall Code Review:**\n\n- The code defines a function `problem()` that constructs a JSON-formatted HTTP problem detail response, following a standard format.\n- It imports `ConnexionResponse` from a local module to generate the response object.\n- It serializes user-provided data (`ext`, `instance`, `type`, etc.) into JSON, which is standard for such utilities.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n- The only potential concern is the inclusion of untrusted data via `ext`, `instance`, or `type`, which could lead to injection if not validated externally. However, this is typical for extensible response formats and not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Reports:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Standard API error response generator.\n- Security assessment: No suspicious code, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0.2 (low, considering potential misuse if inputs are malicious, but not a direct vulnerability)\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar, with emphasis on potential injection via `ext` or other parameters.\n- Security assessment: Potential risk if untrusted data is passed in `ext`, but this is typical and expected.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0.2 (consistent)\n- **Verdict:** Acceptable, with the note that input validation should be performed externally.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Similar, no anomalies.\n- Security assessment: No malicious behavior.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Similar, with emphasis on safe serialization.\n- Security assessment: No issues.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0.1 (very low)\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Similar, straightforward implementation.\n- Security assessment: No malicious activity.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1-0.2), justified by the potential for injection if untrusted data is passed via `ext`, `instance`, or `type`. This is a common consideration for such utility functions, but not an inherent vulnerability.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (acceptable, with the caveat that input validation is necessary externally)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a standard, safe implementation for generating API problem responses. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:**\n\n- Ensure that users of this utility validate and sanitize input parameters, especially `ext`, `instance`, and `type`, to prevent injection or misuse.\n- The import location inside the function is unusual but not malicious; it may be for avoiding circular dependencies.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code is safe, with no malware.\n- The risk scores are appropriate, given the potential for injection if inputs are malicious.\n- No obfuscation detected.\n\n**Overall security posture:** Low risk, well-implemented utility function.",
