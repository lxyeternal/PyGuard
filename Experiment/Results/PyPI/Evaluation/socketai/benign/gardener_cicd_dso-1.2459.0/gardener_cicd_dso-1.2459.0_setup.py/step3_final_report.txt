  "purpose": "Standard setup script for configuring Python package installation, reading version info, dependencies, and scanning modules/packages.",
  "sources": "Reads 'requirements.txt' and 'VERSION' files; scans current directory for Python modules; reads local files for configuration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network activity or dynamic code execution; local file reads are controlled and standard.",
  "flows": "Reads local files -> filters modules/packages -> sets up package configuration; no external or untrusted data flows involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; straightforward logic; no obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python setup script performing local file reads and directory scans with explicit filtering. No dynamic execution, network activity, or obfuscated code is present. The filtering of modules/packages appears deliberate and based on known names, not suspicious. No hardcoded secrets or malicious logic are detected. The code's operations are predictable and standard for package configuration, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard setup configuration with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk (~0.1) are justified and consistent with the code's nature.",
