{
  "purpose": "This script sets up a Python package, defining dependencies, modules, packages, and metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'requirements.txt' file, 'VERSION' file, and scanning the current directory for Python modules.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any typical sink points for malicious data flow such as network, filesystem writes, or command execution.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'requirements.txt' and 'VERSION' files into variables used for setup; directory scanning flows into module and package lists; no untrusted input flow to critical system functions.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs directory scanning and file reading but does not contain any suspicious or obfuscated code. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and 'os', reads version info from a file, and dynamically constructs requirements, modules, and packages lists. It filters out certain modules and packages, presumably those already contained in other components. All file reads are from local, controlled files. No network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated logic observed. The code appears to be a standard setup script with no malicious intent or malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attack vectors, or security risks. It reads local files and configures package metadata securely.",
