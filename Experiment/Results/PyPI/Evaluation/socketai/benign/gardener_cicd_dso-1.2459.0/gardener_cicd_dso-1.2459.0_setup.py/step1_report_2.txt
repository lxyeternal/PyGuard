{
  "purpose": "The script configures the setup for a Python package, defining dependencies, modules, and package data for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from 'VERSION' file, reads requirements from 'requirements.txt', scans current directory for Python modules.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data is written or executed in a way that affects system security.",
  "flows": "Reads version and requirements files to determine dependencies; scans directory to identify modules; removes specific modules/packages from lists before setup.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; standard setup script behavior. No obfuscated code or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical setup configuration tasks: obtaining version info, reading dependencies, scanning for modules, filtering packages, and setting up the package configuration. It uses standard Python and setuptools functions with no suspicious logic, network activity, or data exfiltration. The requirement filtering excludes elasticsearch but does not process untrusted input. No use of dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or credential handling observed. Overall, it appears to be a straightforward setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal setup configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only reads local files and configures package parameters. No malicious intent or security issues are evident.",
