{
  "purpose": "This script sets up the configuration for a Python package, including dependencies, modules, and package data, primarily to facilitate building and distributing the 'gardener-cicd-libs' package.",
  "sources": "Reading of 'requirements.txt', reading the 'VERSION' file, os.scandir() for modules, setuptools.find_packages() for packages.",
  "sinks": "None identified that would lead to data leaks or security effects; no untrusted data is directly written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink flows involving untrusted data; primarily file reads and package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs standard setup tasks without any obfuscated code, hidden data, or unusual behaviors. It excludes certain modules/packages without revealing the criteria, but this is typical in package setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script reads dependency versions from a file, filters modules and packages to exclude known components, and sets up the package configuration. It does not contain any network activity, dynamic code execution, or suspicious logic. The only potential concern is the exclusion of specific modules/packages, but this appears intentional for package management purposes. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code appears standard for a setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It efficiently manages dependencies and package data for distribution without any suspicious behaviors.",
