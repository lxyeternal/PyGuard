{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package, defining dependencies, modules, packages, and package data for installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from 'requirements.txt' and 'VERSION' files, as well as directory listings for modules and packages.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data, but potential issues include reading external files and manipulating package/module lists.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reads ('requirements.txt' and 'VERSION') and directory scans into dependency and package definitions, which are used in setup.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code structure is standard for setup scripts. The removal of certain modules and packages based on known names is normal and predictable.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily gathers package and module information, filters out known modules/packages, and reads external files for versioning and requirements. All file reads are from local files with predictable paths. Directory scans are straightforward. No obfuscated code or malicious logic present. No network or system manipulations are performed. The code appears to be a legitimate setup configuration without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be standard and benign, with no signs of malware, malicious behaviors, or security risks. It safely reads local files and manages package configuration for installation.",
