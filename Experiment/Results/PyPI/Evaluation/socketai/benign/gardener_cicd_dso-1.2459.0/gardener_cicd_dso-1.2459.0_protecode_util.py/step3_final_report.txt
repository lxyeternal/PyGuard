{
  "purpose": "The code manages security scan findings, generates artifact metadata, and interacts with external services to query and delete findings, supporting supply chain security analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from resource nodes, scan results, component objects, and external clients (delivery client, oci client).",
  "sinks": "Deletes outdated findings via delivery client; yields new findings and metadata; interacts with external APIs for querying and reporting.",
  "flows": "Sources (resource nodes, scan results) flow into metadata generation, vulnerability/license processing, and external API calls for querying/deletion; findings are generated and possibly deleted based on current scan data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation; warning about multiple scan results is standard and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard security data processing: generating scan info, filtering vulnerabilities and licenses, updating findings, and cleaning stale data. No malicious, backdoor, or obfuscated code detected. External interactions are typical for security tooling. The logic is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's functions and observed behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate component for managing security findings and metadata, with no indicators of malicious activity or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified based on the static analysis.",
