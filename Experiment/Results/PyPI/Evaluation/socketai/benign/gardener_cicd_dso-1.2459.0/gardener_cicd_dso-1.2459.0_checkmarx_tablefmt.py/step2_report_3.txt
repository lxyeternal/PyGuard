  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical consistency, and the appropriateness of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clear, standard data flow from scan results.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Output via print, no execution of untrusted code.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded credentials or malicious patterns. Notably, the code patches `tabulate.htmlescape` to disable HTML escaping, which could be risky if untrusted data is included in HTML outputs.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The report correctly states that the code is mainly formatting data, with minimal risk. The minimal concern about disabling HTML escaping is acknowledged but deemed controlled, given the data source.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Security Risk: 0.2 (mild, considering the patch to disable escaping)  \n- Overall, reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing safe data handling and no malicious behavior.  \n- The minor typo in `'unkown'` in `ended_on()` is harmless but indicates a small oversight.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0.1 (very low, consistent with the benign description)  \n- Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Reinforces that the code is a benign report generator with no malicious activity.  \n- Slightly higher confidence (0.95), consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0.1  \n- Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Similar to previous reports, with focus on safe data formatting.  \n- The only minor concern again is the override of `tabulate.htmlescape`, which could be exploited if data were malicious, but the report correctly notes this.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0.2 (slightly higher, but still acceptable)  \n- Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Also aligns with previous assessments.  \n- Highlights the same concern about disabling HTML escaping, but no actual malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0.2  \n- Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly elevated (0.1-0.2) due to the patch to disable HTML escaping, which could be exploited if untrusted data were introduced. However, given the context and data sources, this remains a low risk.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- The code appears to be a straightforward, benign report generation utility.\n- The only minor concern is the disabling of HTML escaping, which should be used cautiously if data sources become untrusted.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### My estimated scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (consistent with reports)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (to reflect the potential if untrusted data is introduced via the HTML escaping override, but still low)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the analysis above.",
