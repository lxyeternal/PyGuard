  "purpose": "Generate textual and HTML reports from scan results, including tables and embedded links, for security analysis.",
  "sources": "ScanResult objects, route URL functions, and internal data properties.",
  "sinks": "Formatted output via print, HTML snippets, and URL embedding.",
  "flows": "Data flows from ScanResult properties into formatted tables and HTML, with URL links generated via routes.",
  "anomalies": "Explicit patch to disable HTML escaping (`tabulate.htmlescape = lambda x: x`), which could allow HTML injection if data is untrusted. Minor typo in 'ended_on' function ('unkown') but non-security critical.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward report generator that formats scan data into tables and HTML snippets. No system commands, network calls, or code execution are present. The only notable anomaly is the override of HTML escaping, which could pose injection risks if data sources are compromised. The data originates from controlled models, reducing immediate threat. All scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0) are appropriate. The risk score of 0.2 reflects the potential for injection due to the escaping override, but given the controlled context, this remains low. Minor typo in 'ended_on' does not impact security. Overall, the code is benign, with minimal security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign report formatting utility with a controlled data flow. The only potential vulnerability is the disabling of HTML escaping, which could be exploited if data sources are untrusted. Scores are consistent with this assessment, with malware and obfuscation scores at zero and a low risk score. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.",
