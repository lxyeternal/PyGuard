  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its logic, and the provided assessments.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is primarily responsible for formatting and outputting scan results into tables and HTML snippets.\n- Data sources are 'model.ScanResult' objects and URL routes.\n- No direct system commands, network calls, or data exfiltration are evident.\n- The only noteworthy anomaly is the explicit patch to disable HTML escaping (`tabulate.htmlescape = lambda x: x`), which could introduce security issues if untrusted data is embedded into HTML.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n**Assessment:**\n- No malicious activity detected.\n- Minor concern about disabling HTML escaping.\n- Confidence: 0.9, malware: 0, security risk: 0.2.\n\n**Logic/Code Confirmation:**\n- The code accesses properties like `scan_response`, `artifact_name`, and `scanRiskSeverity`.\n- The 'ended_on' function has a typo ('unkown' instead of 'unknown'), but this is harmless.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 is reasonable.\n- Security risk: 0.2 is slightly elevated due to the HTML escaping override but still low.\n- The report's reasoning aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n**Assessment:**\n- Similar to Report 1, no malicious activity.\n- Slightly higher confidence (0.9), malware: 0, risk: 0.1.\n\n**Logic/Code Confirmation:**\n- The code constructs URLs for links, but these are for display only.\n- The 'htmlescape' override remains, but no malicious behavior is evident.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 is justified.\n- Security risk: 0.1 is appropriate given the minimal concern about HTML escaping.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n**Assessment:**\n- No malicious activity.\n- Confidence: 0.95, malware: 0, risk: 0.1.\n\n**Logic/Code Confirmation:**\n- Minor typo in 'ended_on' ('unkown') but no functional impact.\n- The code's purpose is clear: generating reports.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 is consistent.\n- Security risk: 0.1 aligns with the minimal concern about HTML escaping.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n**Assessment:**\n- Similar to previous reports, no malicious activity.\n- Slightly higher security risk (0.2), possibly due to the HTML escaping override.\n\n**Logic/Code Confirmation:**\n- The report notes potential for injection if data is malicious, which is valid.\n- No evidence of actual malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 remains appropriate.\n- Security risk: 0.2 is reasonable, given the potential for injection if data is untrusted.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n**Assessment:**\n- Same conclusions: benign, no malicious activity.\n- Security risk remains at 0.2 due to the HTML escaping override.\n\n**Logic/Code Confirmation:**\n- The analysis correctly notes that the code mainly formats data.\n- No suspicious code detected.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 is justified.\n- Security risk: 0.2 is consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Judgment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports, which is accurate.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly elevated (0.2) due to the deliberate disabling of HTML escaping, which could be exploited if data sources are compromised, but in this context, the data appears controlled.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code's logic and potential vulnerabilities.\n- The only concern is the patch to disable HTML escaping, which should be used cautiously, especially if data sources could be compromised or untrusted.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — due to the HTML escaping override, which could be exploited if data is malicious.\n\n**Overall, the current scores are appropriate.**",
