{
  "purpose": "The code orchestrates resource grouping, scan request creation, and result handling for security assessments using external APIs (Protecode, OCI, S3, delivery services).",
  "sources": "Resource nodes, environment variables, external API calls (Protecode, OCI, S3, delivery client).",
  "sinks": "External API endpoints, network connections, metadata updates, scan result uploads.",
  "flows": "Reads resource data -> creates scan requests -> uploads or rescans artifacts -> retrieves and processes scan results -> updates metadata and assessments.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a complex orchestration component for security scans, involving resource grouping, scan request generation, and result processing. It interacts with external services in a standard manner for security tooling. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage are present. Error handling and caching are implemented appropriately. External API interactions are typical for such workflows, and no secrets or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured component of a security assessment pipeline. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are justified and consistent with the code's purpose and behavior.",
