  "purpose": "This code is used for setting up a Python package distribution with specified dependencies, modules, and metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'VERSION' file to determine the package version.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external effects are present.",
  "flows": "The version() function reads data from the 'VERSION' file, which is then used as the package version during setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are evident. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and defines functions to specify requirements, modules, and versioning. It reads the package version from a local file, which is common practice. The setup() call correctly uses these functions and includes specified packages and data. There are no suspicious or malicious constructs, obfuscated code, or external network interactions. Overall, the code appears to be a benign package setup script with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It reads version info from a local file and specifies dependencies and packages appropriately.",
