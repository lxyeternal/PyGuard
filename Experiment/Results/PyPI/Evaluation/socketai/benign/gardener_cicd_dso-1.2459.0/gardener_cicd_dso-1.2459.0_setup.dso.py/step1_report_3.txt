  "purpose": "Configure and set up a Python package named 'gardener-cicd-dso' with specified dependencies and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'VERSION' file from the same directory as the script.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no execution or data transmission occurs in the code.",
  "flows": "Reading the version from the 'VERSION' file (source) and passing configuration data to setuptools.setup (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code is straightforward setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script defines functions to specify requirements, modules, and version, and then uses setuptools to configure package setup. It reads the version number from a local file 'VERSION', which is standard practice. The requirements are fixed strings; no user input or external untrusted data is used. There are no network calls, code execution, or data leaks. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present. The code appears to be a normal setup script for a Python package, with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply reads local configuration data and sets up the package accordingly.",
