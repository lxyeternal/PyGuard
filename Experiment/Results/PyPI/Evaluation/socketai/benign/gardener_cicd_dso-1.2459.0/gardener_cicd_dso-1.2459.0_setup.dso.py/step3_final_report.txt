  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging a project, defining dependencies, modules, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads version from local 'VERSION' file; no external inputs or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; code does not process untrusted data or perform actions affecting external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; static configuration without dynamic or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup code with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script using setuptools, with explicit package definitions, version reading from a local file, and fixed dependencies. It does not include dynamic code execution, network calls, or external data handling. All indicators point to benign, standard packaging code. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's nature and are justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python packaging script with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate and should remain as-is.",
