  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the Python package 'gardener-cicd-dso', including dependencies, package data, and versioning.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'VERSION' file to determine package version.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data output or execution observed.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from file -> uses it in package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no backdoors, no suspicious dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It defines dependencies via generators, reads version info from a file, and specifies package metadata. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The use of a file for versioning and standard package configuration appears legitimate. No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical, benign setup script for packaging a Python project. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
