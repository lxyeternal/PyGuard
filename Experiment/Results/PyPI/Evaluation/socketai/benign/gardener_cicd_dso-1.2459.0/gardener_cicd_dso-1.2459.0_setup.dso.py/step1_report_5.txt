  "purpose": "Setup configuration script for a Python package named 'gardener-cicd-dso', defining dependencies, modules, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'VERSION' file to determine the package version.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is used in a dangerous manner.",
  "flows": "The version() function reads data from the local 'VERSION' file, which is then used in the setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and uses standard setup practices. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. No dynamic code execution or network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and os modules, defines functions to specify requirements, modules, and version. It reads the version from a local file and configures package setup parameters such as name, description, Python version requirement, modules, packages, package data, and install requirements. All operations are standard for Python package setup, with no suspicious or malicious code detected. The functions are simple and predictable, and there are no indications of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It simply reads package version info from a local file and sets up dependencies and package metadata.",
