{
  "purpose": "This setup script configures the packaging and distribution of the Python project 'gardener-cicd-dso', specifying dependencies, modules, and metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'VERSION' file to determine package version.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that handle untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The version string read from 'VERSION' is used in the setup configuration, with no other data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for a setup script; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code segments are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and 'os' modules, defines functions to list requirements and modules, and reads the version from a local file. It then calls 'setuptools.setup' with project metadata, dependencies, package data, and modules. The process is straightforward, typical for Python package setup, with no dynamic code execution, environment variable use, or other suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a conventional setup script for a Python package, with no malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks detected. It simply manages package configuration and dependencies.",
