  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - All reports describe the code as a standard API client for Protecode, handling authentication, uploads, scans, and triages.\n   - No report indicates any actual malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n   - The code's logic aligns with typical API client patterns, with no suspicious or malicious behaviors detected.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and thorough, correctly identifying the data flows, sources, sinks, and potential minor concerns (like cookie extraction workaround).\n   - No logical errors or significant flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores given to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious indicators.\n   - Security risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting standard API client risks.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n   - The overall assessments are reasonable and aligned with the code analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for higher risk scores:**\n   - No higher scores are justified because:\n     - The code does not perform malicious actions.\n     - No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present.\n     - The handling of session cookies and tokens, while slightly brittle, is standard practice and not malicious.\n   - The minor concerns (like cookie extraction workaround) do not elevate the risk significantly.\n\n5. **Malware scores:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n   - The code does not contain any malicious payloads, obfuscated logic, or suspicious network behavior.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid assumptions; they base their conclusions on code structure, data flow, and standard practices.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no signs of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — the code is clear and standard.\n- **Security risk score:** 0.2 — typical for an API client handling sensitive data, but no evident vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Final conclusion:\nThe code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured API client for Protecode, with no malicious or sabotage indicators. The minor concerns (cookie handling workaround) are standard and do not elevate the risk.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the given scores.**",
