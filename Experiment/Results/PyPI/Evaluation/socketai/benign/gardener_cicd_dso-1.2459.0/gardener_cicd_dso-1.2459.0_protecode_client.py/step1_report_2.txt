{
  "purpose": "The code provides an API client for interacting with the Protecode platform, including authentication, uploading data, managing products, and retrieving reports.",
  "sources": "Input sources include configuration data (credentials, URLs), user inputs via parameters, and network responses from API requests.",
  "sinks": "Network requests (requests.Session methods), JSON processing, and handling of sensitive data such as tokens, cookies, and credentials.",
  "flows": "Inputs from configuration and parameters are used to construct API requests; tokens and cookies are stored for session management; network responses are processed to extract results and update internal state.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets detected; no unusual or obfuscated code features. Use of request cookies and manual extraction of session IDs is standard but warrants attention. No backdoors, code injections, or hidden behaviors evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured API client for Protecode, handling authentication, API requests, and data management. It manages tokens, cookies, and session state securely. It performs network operations and JSON parsing with standard practices. No suspicious or malicious logic, backdoors, or data leaks are present. The only minor concern is manual extraction of session IDs from cookies, which is a typical workaround but not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate API client with no evidence of malicious behavior. It implements standard request handling, authentication, and data processing without suspicious patterns. Overall, it presents a low security risk with no signs of malware or sabotage.",
