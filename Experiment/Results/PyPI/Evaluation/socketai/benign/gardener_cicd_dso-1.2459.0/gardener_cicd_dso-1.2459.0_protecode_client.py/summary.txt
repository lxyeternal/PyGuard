  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured Protecode API client with no malicious intent or sabotage. The observed patterns and handling are standard, and the minor workaround for cookie extraction does not indicate malicious activity. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), justified by the handling of sensitive data and network interactions."
