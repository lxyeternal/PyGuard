  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports conclude that the code is a legitimate API client for Protecode, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The code handles sensitive data (credentials, tokens) securely, with standard session management.\n- No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network behavior are detected.\n- Minor concerns about cookie extraction workarounds are noted but are standard practice, not malicious.\n- The malware scores assigned are all 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The obfuscated scores are all 0, consistent with the absence of obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Validations:\n\n**1. Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Code:**\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors are evident.\n- The code uses standard libraries and patterns.\n- The workaround for session ID extraction is known and not malicious.\n\n**2. Logical Flaws or Errors in Reports:**\n- All reports correctly identify the code as a standard API client.\n- No incorrect assumptions or overestimations are present.\n- The security risk scores of 0.1–0.2 are reasonable given the handling of sensitive data and network interactions.\n\n**3. Scores Justification:**\n- Malware: 0 in all reports is justified.\n- Obfuscated: 0 in all reports is justified.\n- Security Risk: Slightly above zero (0.1–0.2) due to network interactions and handling of credentials, which is appropriate.\n\n**4. Potential Vulnerabilities or Malicious Behavior:**\n- No evidence of data exfiltration, command injection, or malicious payloads.\n- The only minor concern is the brittle cookie extraction workaround, but this is standard and not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation of the Reports:\n\n- The reports are consistent, detailed, and align with the code's actual structure.\n- No assumptions about malicious intent are unjustified.\n- The low security risk scores are appropriate given the context.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity detected.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Clear, well-structured code with no obfuscation.\n\n**Risk Score:** 0.1–0.2 — Slightly elevated due to network and credential handling, but overall low.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The code appears to be a legitimate, well-implemented API client.\n- No supply chain attack indicators are present.\n- The only potential concern is the brittle cookie extraction workaround, but it is a known pattern, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Estimate |\n|-----------------|----------------|\n| Malware         | 0              |\n| Obfuscated      | 0              |\n| Security Risk   | 0.1 – 0.2      |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, secure, and legitimate Protecode API client with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The minor security risk score reflects the network interactions and session management but does not indicate any malicious intent.\n\n---\n\nPlease let me know if further detailed analysis or specific focus areas are needed.",
