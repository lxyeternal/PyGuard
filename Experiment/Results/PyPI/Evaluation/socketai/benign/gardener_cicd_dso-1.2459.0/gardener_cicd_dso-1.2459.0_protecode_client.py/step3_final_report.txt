  "purpose": "A Python client library for interacting with Protecode's API, handling authentication, uploads, scans, triages, and related operations.",
  "sources": "Network requests to Protecode API endpoints, environment variables for credentials, input parameters for method calls.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests sending data and credentials, cookies and tokens stored and used for session management.",
  "flows": "Initialization of session, authentication flow with cookie/token handling, data uploads, scan polling, and triage management via API calls.",
  "anomalies": "Workaround for cookie extraction in login process; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard API client with session management, token handling, and network communication. The cookie extraction workaround is a known pattern, not malicious. No suspicious control flow, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The security measures are typical for such clients, and the handling of credentials and tokens is appropriate. No backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured Protecode API client with no malicious intent or sabotage. The observed patterns and handling are standard, and the minor workaround for cookie extraction does not indicate malicious activity. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), justified by the handling of sensitive data and network interactions.",
