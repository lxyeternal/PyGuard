  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports conclude that the code is a standard data modeling layer with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- Malware scores are consistently 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n- Security risk scores are low (~0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal concern.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n- Confidence scores are high (~0.9), indicating the reviewers are confident in their assessments.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** No malicious behavior, standard data models, no suspicious code.\n- **Malware score:** 0 → **reasonable**\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 → **reasonable**, given the low risk.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 → **reasonable**\n- **Issues:** No problems found. The reasoning is sound.\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, no malicious activity, standard data handling.\n- **Malware score:** 0 → **reasonable**\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 → **reasonable**\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 → **reasonable**\n- **Issues:** No concerns.\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—safe data models, no malicious code.\n- **Malware score:** 0 → **reasonable**\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 → Slightly higher but still low, possibly reflecting the use of URL parsing, but it's standard.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 → **reasonable**\n- **Issues:** No problems.\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Data models, safe handling, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0 → **reasonable**\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 → consistent\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 → consistent\n- **Issues:** No concerns.\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Same as above, benign code.\n- **Malware score:** 0 → **reasonable**\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 → acceptable\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 → reasonable\n- **Issues:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n- The reports are consistent, and their scores align with the code's nature.\n- No suspicious code, network activity, or obfuscation detected.\n- The use of URL parsing and data deserialization is standard and safe.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns are present.\n\n### **Final recommendation:**\n- **Malware score:** Keep at 0 for all reports; no evidence suggests malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Given the low risk, I would assign a maximum of 0.2 across all reports, consistent with the provided scores.\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (low, due to URL parsing and data handling, but nothing concerning)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is benign, well-structured, and safe for use in supply chain security contexts. No adjustments needed.",
