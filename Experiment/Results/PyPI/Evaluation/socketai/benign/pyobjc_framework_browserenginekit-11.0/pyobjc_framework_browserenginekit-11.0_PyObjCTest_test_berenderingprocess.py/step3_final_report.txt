  "purpose": "Unit testing method signatures and argument types for BrowserEngineKit.BERenderingProcess functions, ensuring correct callback and output parameter configurations.",
  "sources": "Method calls to renderingProcessWithInterruptionHandler_completion_ and makeLibXPCConnectionError_ that accept callback blocks and output parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code only performs argument validation in a testing context.",
  "flows": "Method signature assertions verify argument types; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; code is straightforward test assertions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of unit tests validating method signatures and argument types for Objective-C bridging functions. It uses assertion helpers to confirm callback block signatures and output parameters. There is no data processing, network activity, or malicious behavior. The code is standard testing code, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a signature validation test for framework methods. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores and assessments in the reports are appropriate and accurate.",
