  "purpose": "Unit testing framework interface verification for BrowserEngineKit components, including protocol existence and method signatures.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; code reads only class and method definitions within the framework.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling; no network, file, or system modifications present.",
  "flows": "N/A – the code does not process untrusted data or perform data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward test definitions with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard test suite verifying protocols and method signatures within BrowserEngineKit. It defines a helper class with a simple method and performs assertions on protocol existence and method signatures, including an expected failure. No external data, network activity, or malicious behavior is present. The code is syntactically correct, with no obfuscation or secrets. All signals indicate benign, interface verification purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit testing script with no malicious intent, data leaks, or security risks. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero, and confidence is high.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
