{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a test suite for the BrowserEngineKit framework, specifically testing process capabilities and protocol conformance.",
  "sources": "No explicit sources of untrusted input are present; the code relies on internal framework methods and test assertions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points handling untrusted data; primarily testing framework assertions and method calls.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted data; the flow involves calling framework methods and assertions within tests.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are detected. The code structure is straightforward, focused on testing.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a framework, defines test helper classes, and contains test methods for protocol and method validation. It uses expected failures and assertions to verify method signatures. No network calls, data handling, or external inputs are involved. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. The code's purpose is purely to verify framework conformance and method signatures, typical of standard testing practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite for a framework, with no indicators of malicious intent, data leaks, or security risks. It appears to be standard testing code with no security concerns.",
