{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a test suite for the BrowserEngineKit framework, testing protocol existence and method behaviors in a macOS environment.",
  "sources": "No direct input sources; the code imports modules and tests methods within those modules.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling points are evident; no network, file, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "The code checks method signatures and protocol existence, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes an expected failure decorator, but no suspicious or malicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a framework, defines a helper class with a simple method, and tests protocol existence and method signatures. It uses standard testing patterns without any obfuscated or malicious constructs. There are no signs of data leakage, system manipulation, or malicious network activity. The code solely verifies framework components and their interfaces.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a straightforward test suite for BrowserEngineKit protocols and methods. There are no indications of malicious intent, data leaks, or security risks. It appears safe and standard for its purpose.",
