{
  "purpose": "This code is for setting up Python bindings for the macOS 'BrowserEngineKit' framework using PyObjC, facilitating interaction between Python and Objective-C.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current directory for modules to include, loads system frameworks, and specifies dependencies and extension modules.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or malicious activity are present; setup configuration and module inclusion do not process external inputs.",
  "flows": "The code initializes the setup process, includes modules from the filesystem, links against macOS frameworks, and declares dependencies; there are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code strictly manages setup and dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup procedures for a Python extension module using PyObjC, including path insertion, module listing, and dependency declaration. It interacts solely with local filesystem paths, system frameworks, and package dependencies without processing external inputs or executing untrusted code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script for a Python wrapper around a macOS framework, with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
