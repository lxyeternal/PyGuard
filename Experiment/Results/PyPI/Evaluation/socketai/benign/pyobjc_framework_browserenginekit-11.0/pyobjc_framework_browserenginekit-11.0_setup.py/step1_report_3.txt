{
  "purpose": "Create a Python package wrapping the macOS 'BrowserEngineKit' framework using PyObjC.",
  "sources": "Reading file system for modules, importing standard libraries, and reading version info.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks identified; no network, file writes, or command execution observed.",
  "flows": "No flow from untrusted sources to sinks detected; package setup is static and controlled.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present. The code strictly performs package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, inserts the current directory into sys.path, and defines package setup parameters. It sets up the extension module linked to the 'BrowserEngineKit' framework. All operations are typical for a PyObjC wrapper package, with no indications of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code flow. The code relies on standard practices for building a Python extension module on macOS. No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard package setup script for a macOS framework wrapper with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
