  "purpose": "Setup script for building Python bindings for the macOS 'BrowserEngineKit' framework using PyObjC.",
  "sources": "Filesystem directory 'Modules' for module files, system frameworks via extra_link_args, package dependencies via install_requires.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no network communication or external code execution.",
  "flows": "Filesystem reading of module files to define dependencies; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a standard setup script with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical package setup tasks: adjusting sys.path, reading module files, configuring extension modules linked against system frameworks, and specifying dependencies. It does not process untrusted input, execute external code, or perform network operations. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The minimal security risk score (0.1 in one report) is justified by filesystem interactions common in build scripts but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script for a Python extension module wrapping the 'BrowserEngineKit' framework. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
