{
  "purpose": "A unit test verifying the existence of the 'BETextInteractionDelegate' protocol in the framework.",
  "sources": "Import of 'BrowserEngineKit' and 'PyObjCTools.TestSupport'; the test class accessing the protocol 'BETextInteractionDelegate'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted data, perform network calls, or execute any sink operations.",
  "flows": "The test asserts protocol existence without data flow; no source-to-sink data flow is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected. The import of 'BrowserEngineKit' could be environment-dependent but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static check for a protocol's existence, with no data processing, network activity, or malicious behavior. The import of 'BrowserEngineKit' is standard in macOS/iOS development; unless sourced from an untrusted or malicious source, it poses no risk. All reports correctly identify the benign nature. The malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and the security risk score should be minimal, around 0.1, to reflect potential environment trust concerns. Confidence in benign assessment is high (near 1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit test verifying protocol existence with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores should be malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1.",
