  "purpose": "Unit test for the BETextInputDelegate protocol and its helper class, ensuring protocol existence and method behavior.",
  "sources": "Import of BrowserEngineKit module, method return statement.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only checks protocol existence and method signatures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a helper class inheriting from an Objective-C NSObject, implementing a method that returns a boolean value. The test case verifies the existence of a protocol and the return type of the method, both typical in unit testing. No external data, network activity, or sensitive data handling is involved. The code appears to be a straightforward test setup for a macOS/iOS framework feature.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard unit test for protocol and method verification with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
