{
  "purpose": "The code defines a test suite for accessibility helper classes, verifying constants and method signatures related to accessibility features within the BrowserEngineKit framework.",
  "sources": "Class attributes, constants, and method signatures; no dynamic data or external input handling.",
  "sinks": "No data flows from untrusted sources; no external network, file, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "The code primarily consists of static assertions and method signatures without data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign test scaffold verifying interface conformance for accessibility features. It contains no malicious logic, network activity, or data leaks. The constants and methods are straightforward, serving as interface definitions and test assertions. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign test suite for accessibility interface verification with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The scores of 0 for malware and obfuscation, and a very low risk score, are justified and accurate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
