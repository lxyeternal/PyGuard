{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a test suite and a helper class for accessibility features within the BrowserEngineKit framework, primarily for testing and interface purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports from BrowserEngineKit, PyObjCTools, and objc; class methods that return fixed values or pass; constants definitions; test assertions.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or cause side effects; method implementations only return fixed values or pass; no network, file, or system modification commands.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; methods are simple getters/setters with no complex data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; the code strictly appears to set up tests and interface placeholders. No obfuscated or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a helper class with methods returning constant values or passing without performing any side effects. The test class verifies constants and method signatures related to accessibility features, including enum types and type annotations. There are no dynamic data processing, network calls, or suspicious operations. The code is consistent with a test setup for a framework and contains no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite and helper class setup for accessibility features in the BrowserEngineKit framework. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content.",
