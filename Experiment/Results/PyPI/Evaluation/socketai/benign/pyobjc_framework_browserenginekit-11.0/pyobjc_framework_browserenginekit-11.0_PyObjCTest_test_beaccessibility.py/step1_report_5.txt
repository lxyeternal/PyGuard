{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a set of accessibility helper classes and constants for use with BrowserEngineKit, primarily for accessibility testing and interface interaction.",
  "sources": "The code reads class constants and method parameters; no external or untrusted data sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could cause data leaks or malicious actions are present; the code only defines methods and constants.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; methods do not process or handle external input in a manner that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. All methods seem standard and align with accessibility interface definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily establishes a set of constants and method stubs for accessibility features, with no data input, output, or external interactions. No hardcoded credentials or malicious behavior is evident. The methods are either returning fixed values or are placeholders (pass statements). There is no evidence of data leakage, malicious payloads, or backdoors. The structure and naming are consistent with standard accessibility API implementations.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard accessibility helper implementation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is solely defining interface constants and method stubs for accessibility features. No suspicious or malicious activity is present.",
