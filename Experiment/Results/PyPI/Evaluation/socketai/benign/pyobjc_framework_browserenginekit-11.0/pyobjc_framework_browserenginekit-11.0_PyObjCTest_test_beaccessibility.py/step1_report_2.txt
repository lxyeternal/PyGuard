{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a test suite for the BrowserEngineKit framework, specifically testing accessibility helper classes and constants.",
  "sources": "Imports from BrowserEngineKit, PyObjCTools.TestSupport, and objc modules. Class methods that return constant values and properties.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted input data; the code primarily defines constants and method signatures for testing purposes.",
  "flows": "The code tests accessor and mutator methods for accessibility properties but does not process untrusted data or execute external commands.",
  "anomalies": "The code is purely structural, with no apparent malicious logic. It doesn't perform data handling, network operations, or system modifications. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up test cases for the BrowserEngineKit framework's accessibility features, verifying constants and method types. It uses standard testing assertions for Objective-C bindings. No dynamic code execution, data handling, or external interactions are observed. The code is straightforward and appears to be a standard testing scaffold without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this code. It serves as a test suite for accessibility features and does not perform any harmful actions or data leaks.",
