  "purpose": "Build and test configuration script for PyObjC, gathering system info, SDK paths, and managing test modules.",
  "sources": "System commands (sw_vers, clang, xcrun), environment variables, file reads (plist, headers), dynamic module imports.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess outputs influencing build info, dynamic import of test modules, file writes for build info.",
  "flows": "System commands and environment variables provide data used in build configuration and test execution; dynamic imports execute test code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. Reliance on subprocess and dynamic imports could be exploited if environment is compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard build and test setup routines for macOS Python extensions, using system calls for version info and SDK detection, and dynamically importing test modules. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The subprocess calls are typical for such scripts, and dynamic imports are standard in testing frameworks but could pose risks if environment integrity is compromised. The code's structure is clear and well-understood, with no suspicious patterns. The scores reflect this: malware=0, obfuscated=0, with low to moderate security risk depending on environment trustworthiness.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate build and test configuration for PyObjC on macOS, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The potential attack surface from subprocess and dynamic imports justifies a moderate risk score (around 0.2-0.4), but no active malicious activity is detected.",
