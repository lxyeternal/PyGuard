{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for the PyObjC framework, handling package configuration, building, testing, and installation.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., CFLAGS, PATH), subprocess outputs (sw_vers, clang, xcrun), file reads (e.g., SDKSettings.plist, pyobjc-api.h), user inputs (e.g., sys.argv).",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls (e.g., sw_vers, clang, xcrun), file writes (e.g., pyobjc-build-info.txt, PKG-INFO), environment variable access, dynamic import of test modules.",
  "flows": "Subprocess outputs (system info, compiler version) used for configuration, environment variables and file data influence build flags and SDK detection, test modules are dynamically imported and executed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. The script performs extensive environment and system inspection, which is standard for build scripts. No suspicious network activity or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script dynamically gathers system information, manages build configurations, and runs tests. It uses subprocesses to obtain system version, SDK paths, and compiler info, which are typical in build environments. No code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are evident. It modifies sys.path and loads modules for testing, which could be misused if malicious modules are present, but this is standard for testing frameworks. No hidden backdoors or suspicious behaviors are identified. The code is well-structured for its purpose without indications of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a sophisticated but standard setup and test harness for a Python package, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It primarily performs system inspection, build configuration, and testing routines common in open-source Python projects.",
