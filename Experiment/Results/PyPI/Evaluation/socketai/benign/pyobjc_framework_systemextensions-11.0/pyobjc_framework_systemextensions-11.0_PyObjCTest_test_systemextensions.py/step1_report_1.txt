  "purpose": "Unit tests for the SystemExtensions module, verifying enums, constants, protocols, classes, and method signatures.",
  "sources": "Imports SystemExtensions, uses assertions on its enums, constants, classes, and methods.",
  "sinks": "Assertions and method calls that check types, values, and protocol/class existence.",
  "flows": "Import of SystemExtensions -> Use of assertions to validate properties and methods within the module.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code primarily performs validation and testing routines.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of unit tests designed to verify the presence and types of constants, enums, protocols, and classes within the SystemExtensions module. It also checks method signatures and protocol existence. All operations are standard test assertions; no external input handling or untrusted data flows are present. The code does not perform any network operations, file manipulations, or system modifications. No suspicious or malicious logic was detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of unit tests for the SystemExtensions API. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. Its purpose is validation, and there are no signs of security risks or malicious intent.",
