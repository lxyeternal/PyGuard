{
  "purpose": "The code is a unit test suite for the SystemExtensions module, testing enum types, constants, protocols, classes, and methods related to system extensions on macOS.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it primarily accesses attributes and methods from the SystemExtensions module and related testing frameworks.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no data flows leading to output or system actions based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code is solely performing static assertions on constants, types, and method signatures.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a standard test suite without unusual code constructs. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a system extension module and runs various assertions to verify the existence and properties of constants, enums, protocols, classes, and methods. It performs version-specific checks to ensure features are present on certain OS or SDK levels. All operations are read-only and intended for validation purposes. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. The code structure and usage are typical for a testing module with no anomalies or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign test suite for the SystemExtensions framework on macOS. It contains no malicious intent or malicious code, and no security risks are present. It is safe and standard in its purpose.",
