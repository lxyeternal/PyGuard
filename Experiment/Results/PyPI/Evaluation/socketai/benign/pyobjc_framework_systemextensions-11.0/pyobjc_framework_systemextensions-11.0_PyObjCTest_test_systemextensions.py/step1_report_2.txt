  "purpose": "Unit tests for the SystemExtensions module, validating enums, constants, protocols, classes, and method behaviors.",
  "sources": "Import statement for SystemExtensions module, test assertions that access module attributes and methods.",
  "sinks": "Assertions accessing module attributes and calling methods; no external data input/output or network operations.",
  "flows": "Test assertions access module constants, methods, and properties; no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Test code appears standard and consistent with unit testing practices.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard unit testing of the SystemExtensions module, checking enum types, constants, protocols, classes, and method signatures. It employs conditional decorators based on OS and SDK levels, typical for platform-dependent modules. No signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors are present. The code strictly verifies API attributes and behaviors without executing external data or system commands.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign test suite for the SystemExtensions module, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
