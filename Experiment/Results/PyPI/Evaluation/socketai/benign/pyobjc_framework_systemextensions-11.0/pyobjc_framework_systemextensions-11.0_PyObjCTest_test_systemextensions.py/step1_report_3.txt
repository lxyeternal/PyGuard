  "purpose": "Unit tests for the SystemExtensions module, primarily validating constants, protocols, classes, and method signatures.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing SystemExtensions; various assertions accessing attributes and methods of SystemExtensions.",
  "sinks": "Assertions and attribute access which are standard testing operations; no untrusted data handling or external input.",
  "flows": "N/A - typical test code flow, no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious operations detected. The code consists solely of test assertions and type checks.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific system extension module and performs a series of unit tests to verify enum types, constants, protocol existence, class presence, method signatures, and metadata sanity. All operations are confined to static attribute checks and assertions within a testing framework. There are no dynamic code executions, data manipulations, or external data handling. No code injection, malicious behaviors, or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard test code verifying the presence and types of constants, classes, protocols, and methods in the SystemExtensions module. It contains no malicious or suspicious logic, backdoors, or security risks.",
