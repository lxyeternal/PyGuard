  "purpose": "Unit testing for SystemExtensions module functionalities, constants, protocols, and methods related to system extension management.",
  "sources": "import statement for SystemExtensions module, various assertions accessing attributes, constants, methods, and protocols of SystemExtensions.",
  "sinks": "Assertions and method calls access attributes and methods; no untrusted data input, network operations, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow involving untrusted input. The code merely accesses attributes and verifies constants and methods within a test environment.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. All code appears to be standard unit testing procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static assertions to verify types, constants, protocols, classes, and method behaviors in the SystemExtensions module. No data input/output, network operations, or execution of external code are present. The code is straightforward, structured as typical unit tests, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit test suite for the SystemExtensions module, containing no malicious behavior or security risks. It verifies API attributes, constants, and methods with no indications of sabotage, data leakage, or malware.",
