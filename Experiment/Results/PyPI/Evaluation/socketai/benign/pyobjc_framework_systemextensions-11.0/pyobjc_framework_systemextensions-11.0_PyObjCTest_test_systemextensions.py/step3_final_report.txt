{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests verifying the presence and types of constants, enums, protocols, classes, and method signatures within the SystemExtensions module, primarily for validation purposes.",
  "sources": "Assertions on module attributes, constants, enums, protocols, classes, and method signatures; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks or system modifications.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assertions and method signatures verification without data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static unit tests verifying API attributes, types, and existence. It performs no dynamic operations, network calls, or data manipulations. All assertions confirm the presence and correctness of constants, protocols, classes, and methods. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk approximately 0.1) are consistent with the benign, validation-only nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test suite with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate and justified. No further action is necessary.",
