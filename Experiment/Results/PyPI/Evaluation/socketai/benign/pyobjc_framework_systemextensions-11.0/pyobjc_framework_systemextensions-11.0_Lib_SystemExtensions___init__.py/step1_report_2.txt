{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a Python wrapper for the SystemExtensions framework on macOS, enabling Python code to interact with system extensions via Objective-C bridging.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, Foundation, objc, and local modules; dynamic framework path and method registration.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic attribute creation (__dir__, __getattr__), framework method registration, and deletion of a module entry from sys.modules.",
  "flows": "Imports and framework setup lead to dynamic attribute functions that facilitate framework interaction, with no evident data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic method registration and deletion from sys.modules; no explicit handling of user input or untrusted data; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns; the code appears to be a typical framework wrapper without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a framework connection to Apple's SystemExtensions, creates dynamic attribute functions for framework access, and registers unavailable methods for certain classes. It deletes a module reference from sys.modules, likely for cleanup or encapsulation. All operations are standard for framework bindings and do not show signs of malicious intent or sabotage. No data leaks, suspicious network activity, or backdoors are evident. The code relies on system libraries and Objective-C bridge functions, with no indication of covert behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python binding for macOS system framework access, with no malicious or suspicious activity detected. It appears safe and intended solely for system extension interactions.",
