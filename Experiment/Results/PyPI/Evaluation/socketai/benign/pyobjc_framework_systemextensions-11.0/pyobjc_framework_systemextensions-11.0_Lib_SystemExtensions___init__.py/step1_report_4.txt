{
  "purpose": "The code sets up and exposes a Python mapping for the macOS SystemExtensions framework, allowing Python code to interface with system extensions via Objective-C bindings.",
  "sources": "Import statements (`import sys`, `import Foundation`, `import objc`, and relative imports `_metadata`, `_SystemExtensions`), framework path resolution (`objc.pathForFramework`), and method registration (`objc.registerUnavailableMethod`).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the code mainly performs framework setup, imports, and method registration without handling untrusted input or data.",
  "flows": "Initialization and import flow: source imports → framework setup → method registration → cleanup. No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically creates framework directory and attribute functions, registers unavailable methods, and deletes a module from sys.modules. These are typical in framework bindings but could be misused if not properly controlled. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically loads the SystemExtensions framework and sets up Python bindings to interface with it. It registers certain methods as unavailable, potentially to prevent their use. The removal of the '_metadata' module from sys.modules is a cleanup step. All actions are typical for framework setup scripts and do not involve network activity, data exfiltration, or privilege escalation mechanisms. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malicious code injection. The overall structure is straightforward, focused on framework interoperability.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for a Python binding to a system framework, with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It performs framework initialization and method registration in a typical manner without suspicious behavior.",
