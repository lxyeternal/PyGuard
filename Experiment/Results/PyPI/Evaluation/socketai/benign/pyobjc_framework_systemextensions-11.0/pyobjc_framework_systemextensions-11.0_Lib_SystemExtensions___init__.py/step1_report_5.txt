{
  "purpose": "This code provides a Python mapping for the SystemExtensions framework on macOS, enabling Python scripts to interact with system extensions via Objective-C bridge functions.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (sys, Foundation, objc, local modules) and dynamically creates framework directory and attribute functions.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic attribute creation and method registration through objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr and objc.registerUnavailableMethod could potentially be misused if misconfigured, but in this context they are standard framework setup calls.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules -> creates framework directory and attribute functions -> registers unavailable methods -> deletes a module from sys.modules -> cleans up setup function.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The use of dynamic function creation and method registration appears standard for framework bindings, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up Python bindings for the macOS SystemExtensions framework, dynamically creating attribute and directory functions, and marking specific methods as unavailable. It then removes a module from sys.modules to clean up. All operations are typical for such bindings and do not involve any malicious or suspicious activity. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious data flows are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, legitimate framework binding setup for macOS SystemExtensions, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
