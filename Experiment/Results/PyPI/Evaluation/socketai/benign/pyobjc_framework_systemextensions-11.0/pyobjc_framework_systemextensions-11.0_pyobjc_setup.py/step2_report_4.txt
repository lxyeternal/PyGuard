  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the technical details, potential security implications, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a build/test setup script for PyObjC, performing system info gathering, environment configuration, and module loading. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies that the script mainly invokes system commands (`sw_vers`, `clang`, `xcrun`) and reads configuration files, all standard for a build environment. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The low risk score (0.2) seems appropriate, considering the script's purpose and behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on environment detection, SDK configuration, and test execution. No malicious activity or obfuscation found.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis is consistent. The code's use of subprocess and environment variables is typical for build scripts. No malicious behavior is evident. The risk score remains appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on environment detection, SDK info, and test module loading. No suspicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the code performs standard system info gathering and module importation. No signs of malicious intent. The low risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing build/test setup, environment variables, subprocess calls, and module imports. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis aligns with the code's behavior. The very low risk score (0.1) is reasonable, given the lack of suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Describes the script as a standard setup/build/test script, noting subprocess calls and environment manipulation. No malicious behavior or obfuscation observed.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is consistent. The code's operations are typical for such build scripts, and no malicious activity is evident.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The script does not perform any malicious actions—no network activity, data exfiltration, or sabotage.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting the inherent risks in executing system commands and dynamic module loading, but overall very low.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious code, payloads, or backdoors are present.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — The code is clear and standard for build scripts.\n- **Security risk:** **0.1–0.2** — Slight inherent risk due to system command execution and dynamic module loading, but nothing malicious.\n\n**Overall:** The reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a typical, legitimate build and test setup script with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**My personal estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** (considering the potential for environment manipulation but no actual malicious intent)\n\nThis conservative estimate aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
