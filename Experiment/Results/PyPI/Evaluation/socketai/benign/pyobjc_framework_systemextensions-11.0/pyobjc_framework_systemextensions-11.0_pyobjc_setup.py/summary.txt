  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate build and testing setup for PyObjC with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to reliance on system commands and environment variables, which is standard in such contexts. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting the low but inherent risks of environment-dependent scripts."
