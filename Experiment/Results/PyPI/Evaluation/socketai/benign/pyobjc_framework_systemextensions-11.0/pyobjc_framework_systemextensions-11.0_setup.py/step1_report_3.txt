{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package with wrappers for the macOS SystemExtensions framework, enabling Python to interface with this framework via PyObjC.",
  "sources": "Reading the file's own directory (os.path.dirname(__file__)), listing files in the 'Modules' directory (os.listdir('Modules'))",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data processed or transmitted",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically constructs dependencies based on the contents of the 'Modules' directory, which could be manipulated if an attacker controls that directory. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code detected. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a standard setup for a Python package using setuptools, importing os and sys modules to determine the current directory. It dynamically generates dependencies by listing the 'Modules' directory, which could be a minor concern if an attacker can modify this directory. Otherwise, the code appears straightforward and intended for packaging a PyObjC wrapper. No network connections, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code does not execute untrusted input or perform any suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package providing macOS framework wrappers, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. The only minor concern is the dynamic listing of modules, which could be exploited if the directory contents are maliciously altered.",
