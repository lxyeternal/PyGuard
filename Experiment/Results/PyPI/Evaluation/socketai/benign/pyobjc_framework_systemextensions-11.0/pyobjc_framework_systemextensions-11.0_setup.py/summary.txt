  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, non-malicious setup script for a Python package wrapping a macOS framework. The risk is minimal, primarily related to directory content manipulation, which is a common and generally safe pattern. The scores assigned by the reports are appropriate, with a very low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) reflecting this minor concern."
