{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for building and installing a Python package that provides wrappers for the macOS SystemExtensions framework using PyObjC.",
  "sources": "Reads the script files (__file__), environment variables (via sys.path), and the contents of the Modules directory.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the script does not execute or process untrusted data in a way that leads to security concerns.",
  "flows": "N/A — the script primarily sets up build configuration without data processing or network flows.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code present. Uses standard setup pattern for Python extension modules.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules (os, sys), modifies sys.path to include the local directory, and imports setup tools from pyobjc_setup. It defines package metadata and configuration for building a macOS framework wrapper using a C extension module. The code dynamically lists files in the Modules directory to set dependencies, but this is a common pattern in setup scripts. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious constructs are present. It strictly serves as a build configuration script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It solely configures the build process for a PyObjC framework wrapper.",
