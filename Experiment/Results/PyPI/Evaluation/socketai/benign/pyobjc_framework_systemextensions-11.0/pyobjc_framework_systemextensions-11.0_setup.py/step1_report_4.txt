{
  "purpose": "This code sets up a Python package that provides wrappers for the macOS SystemExtensions framework, enabling Python programs to interface with system-level extensions on macOS.",
  "sources": "Reading the current script directory, importing system modules, and specifying extension source files in 'Modules/_SystemExtensions.m'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; the code primarily performs package setup and configuration.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted input; the script configures extensions based on local filesystem and static parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors detected. The code mainly performs standard package setup without hidden or obfuscated components.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, modifies sys.path, and uses the 'pyobjc_setup' to configure a package for macOS system extensions. It dynamically lists files in the 'Modules' directory to include as dependencies, but all operations are straightforward setup procedures. No hardcoded secrets, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is focused on building a package for system extension wrappers, with no indication of malicious intent or malware activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script for a Python package related to macOS system extensions. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or obfuscated code. It is safe based on the provided content.",
