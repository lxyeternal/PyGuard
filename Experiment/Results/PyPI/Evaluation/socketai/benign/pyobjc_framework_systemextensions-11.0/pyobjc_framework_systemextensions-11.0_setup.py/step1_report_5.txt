{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package that provides wrappers for the macOS SystemExtensions framework, enabling Python code to interface with native macOS system extensions.",
  "sources": "os.path.dirname(__file__), os.listdir('Modules'), and __doc__ (module docstring)",
  "sinks": "The setup() function and Extension() constructor that initiate package build and compile extension modules",
  "flows": "Reading the script's __doc__ and import statements (sources) to the setup() call that configures package installation, and the dynamically generated list of dependencies based on directory contents",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded credentials, no network calls, and no obfuscated or misleading code. The script performs standard setup procedures for a Python extension module",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, modifies sys.path, and defines a setup configuration for a Python package. It dynamically constructs dependencies based on existing files in the 'Modules' directory, which is typical for extension modules. There are no signs of malicious code such as network activity, credential handling, or obfuscation. The script appears to be a legitimate build setup for a macOS framework wrapper, with no hidden or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup script for a Python package wrapping macOS system extensions. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks.",
