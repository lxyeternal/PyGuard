{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up metadata and function definitions for managing system extensions and their interactions within an Objective-C environment, likely for macOS system extension handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads system architecture information (`sys.maxsize`, `objc.arch`) and sets up metadata for Objective-C selectors and properties related to system extensions.",
  "sinks": "The code interacts with Objective-C runtime functions (`objc.registerMetaDataForSelector`) and system extension properties, but does not perform any data output or external communication.",
  "flows": "Reads system architecture → defines conditional functions → registers Objective-C method metadata → updates internal metadata structures.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious function calls are present. The code mostly performs system metadata setup. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally defines simple functions based on system architecture and pointer size, then registers metadata for Objective-C selectors related to system extension management. It manipulates internal data structures and interacts with the Objective-C runtime for system extension objects. There is no evidence of malicious data handling, network activity, or system modification. The code is typical for setting up Objective-C bindings or metadata and does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for Objective-C runtime metadata related to system extensions, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is likely part of a legitimate macOS system extension management process.",
