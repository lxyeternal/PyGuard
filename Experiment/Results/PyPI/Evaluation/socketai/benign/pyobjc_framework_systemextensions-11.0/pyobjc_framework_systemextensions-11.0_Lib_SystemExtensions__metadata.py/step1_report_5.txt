{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up metadata and function definitions related to system extension handling, likely for macOS, involving Objective-C interoperation.",
  "sources": "Reads system architecture info (sys.maxsize), Objective-C architecture (objc.arch), and performs metadata registration via objc.registerMetaDataForSelector.",
  "sinks": "Metadata registration calls, potentially enabling dynamic method handling, which could be misused to inject malicious behavior if malicious data or code is supplied during runtime.",
  "flows": "System info (architecture) influences function definitions; metadata registration functions serve as sinks where untrusted input (method signatures, arguments) could influence system behavior if compromised.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically registers Objective-C method metadata, which could be exploited if external input influences these registrations. The use of hardcoded strings for method signatures and constants is benign but noteworthy. No explicit hardcoded secrets or credentials are present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily defines platform-dependent functions and registers Objective-C method metadata related to system extensions. It uses system architecture info and Objective-C runtime functions to set up method signatures and behavior. The registration of methods is done via 'objc.registerMetaDataForSelector', which could be dangerous if influenced by untrusted input, but here it appears to be hardcoded. There are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior. The code is structurally standard for macOS extension handling, with no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup for Objective-C metadata registration related to system extensions, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be standard infrastructure code for macOS extension management.",
