{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a generated metadata registration script for Objective-C classes and methods, likely used for interfacing with macOS system extensions and related functionalities.",
  "sources": "The code reads system architecture via sys.maxsize and objc.arch, and interacts with Objective-C runtime metadata registration functions.",
  "sinks": "The code registers metadata for Objective-C selectors and classes, which could influence system behavior if maliciously altered, but there are no apparent untrusted data inputs or data leaks.",
  "flows": "System architecture checks and objc.arch influence function definitions; registration functions (objc.registerMetaDataForSelector) set up method metadata; no external untrusted data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; the code is mostly metadata registration. The string constants appear to be system-related keys and error codes; no suspicious or malicious code or backdoors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward metadata registration utility for Objective-C classes and methods related to system extensions on macOS. It checks system architecture and architecture-specific logic, then registers method metadata. The constants include system extension keys and error codes. No user input, network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code is typical for bridging or interfacing with system APIs, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, generated system interface script for Objective-C metadata registration. There are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears to serve a legitimate purpose in system extension management.",
