{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up metadata and function definitions for Objective-C interoperability, likely for managing system extensions on macOS.",
  "sources": "Imports (objc, sys), system information (sys.maxsize, objc.arch), and embedded constant and enum strings.",
  "sinks": "The registration of Objective-C methods via objc.registerMetaDataForSelector, which could influence system extension behavior, but only within the context of metadata setup.",
  "flows": "Initialization of constants and enums -> conditionally defining functions based on system architecture -> registering Objective-C selectors with metadata -> final cleanup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. The code performs standard setup for Objective-C method metadata registration, with no network activity, file modifications, or external data handling.",
  "analysis": "The script configures metadata for Objective-C classes and methods related to system extensions. It uses system information to define simple functions and registers method signatures for NSObject and related classes. There are no dynamic code executions, no data leaks, nor indications of malicious behavior. The purpose seems to be enabling or facilitating system extension management via Objective-C bindings. The code is structured, with clear separation of setup and cleanup, and contains no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign setup script for Objective-C metadata related to macOS system extensions. It performs standard registration procedures without any malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
