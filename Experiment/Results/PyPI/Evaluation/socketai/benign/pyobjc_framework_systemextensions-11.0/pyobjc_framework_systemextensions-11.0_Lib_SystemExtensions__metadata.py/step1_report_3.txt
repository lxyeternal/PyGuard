{
  "purpose": "This code appears to set up metadata and type definitions for interacting with macOS system extensions and Objective-C runtime functions, likely as part of a larger system or application that manages or interacts with system extensions.",
  "sources": "Reading system architecture information from sys.maxsize, reading objc.arch, importing modules (objc, sys, typing), defining functions and constants, and registering metadata for Objective-C selectors.",
  "sinks": "The registerMetaDataForSelector function calls potentially accept data related to system extension requests and operations; however, these are standard metadata registrations rather than handling untrusted input directly.",
  "flows": "The code flows from determining system architecture and architecture-specific function selection, through defining constants and types, to registering Objective-C method metadata, with no direct data flow from untrusted sources to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The constants and type definitions are standard. The registration of Objective-C selectors is typical for setting up runtime behaviors. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment detection (system architecture, CPU architecture), defines some type aliases with NewType, and registers metadata for Objective-C selectors related to system extension requests and notifications. All operations are standard for macOS system programming. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or external communication. The constants include only system extension-related keys and error codes, which are typical. The use of objc.registerMetaDataForSelector indicates setup for method signatures, not executing untrusted code. Overall, the code appears to be legitimate system configuration code with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign setup script for macOS system extension interactions using Objective-C runtime metadata registration. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks.",
