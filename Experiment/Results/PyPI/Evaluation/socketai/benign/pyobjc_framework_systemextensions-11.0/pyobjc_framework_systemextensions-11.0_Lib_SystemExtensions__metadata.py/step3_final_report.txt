{
  "purpose": "This code sets up Objective-C runtime metadata for system extensions on macOS, including environment detection and method signature registration for relevant classes.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (sys.maxsize, objc.arch), static strings for constants and enums, and calls to objc.registerMetaDataForSelector for method signatures.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code performs static registration without external input or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Environment detection flows into registration calls; static data flows into metadata registration functions; no dynamic or untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, generated boilerplate for Objective-C method registration with no obfuscation or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment checks and registers Objective-C method signatures for classes related to system extensions. It uses static data and standard API calls without external data or network activity. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The code is typical infrastructure for system extension management, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for legitimate Objective-C runtime setup for macOS system extensions. It poses minimal security risk and contains no malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores are consistent with its purpose and behavior.",
