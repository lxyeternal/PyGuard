  "purpose": "This code implements a Django middleware for Application Insights telemetry collection, tracking requests, responses, and exceptions for monitoring purposes.",
  "sources": "Request data from HTTP request objects, such as request method, URL, headers, user info, and view arguments.",
  "sinks": "Telemetry data sent to Application Insights endpoint; exception tracking and telemetry submission via TelemetryClient.",
  "flows": "Request data is collected during process_request, then submitted at process_response; view arguments are added during process_view; exceptions are tracked in process_exception.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; no external network connections other than telemetry endpoint; no data leaks or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django middleware for telemetry purposes, leveraging the applicationinsights SDK. It collects request metadata, view info, and exceptions, then submits telemetry data. The telemetry endpoint is configurable, and there are no signs of malicious logic, such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or backdoors. The code follows typical patterns, with proper handling of different Django versions. No hardcoded secrets other than the default instrumentation key placeholder, which is expected in configuration. There are no indications of code injection, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of telemetry middleware with no malicious intent or suspicious activity detected. It adheres to expected patterns and does not contain malicious payloads or security risks. Overall, it appears safe, with low malware and security risk scores.",
