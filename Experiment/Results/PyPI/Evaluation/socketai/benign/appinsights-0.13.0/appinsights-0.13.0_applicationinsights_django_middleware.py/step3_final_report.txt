  "purpose": "This code implements a Django middleware for Application Insights telemetry collection, capturing request data, exceptions, and view arguments, and sending telemetry via the Application Insights SDK.",
  "sources": "Request method, request URL, request META data (REMOTE_ADDR, HTTP_USER_AGENT), view function attributes, exception info from sys.exc_info()",
  "sinks": "applicationinsights.TelemetryClient instances sending data to configured endpoint, including request, exception, and view telemetry",
  "flows": "Request data flows from process_request to telemetry client; exceptions are tracked via process_exception; view args are added in process_view; data is sent during process_response",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets other than placeholder instrumentation key; no obfuscation; no suspicious network activity; standard SDK usage; no dynamic code or backdoors",
  "analysis": "The code follows standard patterns for Django middleware, capturing request metadata, handling exceptions, and sending telemetry via the Application Insights SDK. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or sabotage are present. The endpoint URL and instrumentation key are configurable, and no secrets are hardcoded. The code structure is typical, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs. Exception handling is standard, and view arguments are optionally logged. The telemetry client is instantiated appropriately, and data is sent during response processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured telemetry middleware for Django applications, with no indications of malicious intent, sabotage, or supply chain compromise. It uses standard SDK practices, handles data securely, and contains no obfuscated or suspicious code segments.",
