  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the 'appinsights' Python project, defining metadata, dependencies, and test configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads static README.rst file for long description; no untrusted input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; no untrusted data flows.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow from sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script that imports modules, reads a static README file, and calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and test suite. It contains no dynamic code, network calls, user input handling, or obfuscated/malicious code. All dependencies are standard libraries or common HTTP packages. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's structure and content are straightforward and align with best practices for Python packaging.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package configuration file with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the code's static and harmless nature.",
