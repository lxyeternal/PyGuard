  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of an Application Insights telemetry client with no malicious or security-threatening behavior. It transmits telemetry data as intended, with no signs of sabotage or malicious activity. The low security risk score reflects the nature of telemetry data transmission, which is expected and not inherently dangerous."
