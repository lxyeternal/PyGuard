{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific functions and classes from a local module named LoggingHandler, likely for logging setup or management within a larger project.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the local module .LoggingHandler, specifically 'enable' and 'LoggingHandler'.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data inputs, external data handling, or network operations present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "The code imports components that may be used later in the application; no data flows are observable within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and standard for modular Python projects.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two import statements from a local module, with no additional logic, data processing, or external interactions. The import statements are typical and do not involve any suspicious or malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No anomalies or signs of malicious intent are evident. The high confidence scores reflect the clarity and simplicity of the code. Overall, the code is benign, and the assessments are accurate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign import statement with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
