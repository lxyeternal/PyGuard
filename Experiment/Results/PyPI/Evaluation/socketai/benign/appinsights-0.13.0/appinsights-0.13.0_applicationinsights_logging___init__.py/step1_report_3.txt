  "purpose": "The code appears to be importing functions or classes related to logging management from a local module named LoggingHandler.",
  "sources": "Import statements from a local module (.LoggingHandler). No external input reading.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or potential data leaks are evident in these import statements.",
  "flows": "No data flows are established in this snippet as it only contains import statements.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with straightforward imports. No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'enable' and 'LoggingHandler' from a module named 'LoggingHandler' in the same package. There are no functions, data processing, or other logic that could indicate malicious activity. The imports are standard and do not suggest any malicious intent. No suspicious or obfuscated code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple import statement for a local logging utility module, showing no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical code structure for modular Python projects.",
