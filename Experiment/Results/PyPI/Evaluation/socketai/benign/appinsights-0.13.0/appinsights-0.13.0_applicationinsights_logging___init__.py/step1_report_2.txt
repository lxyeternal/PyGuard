  "purpose": "Import statements for modules or classes related to logging functionality",
  "sources": "Import statements from the local package, specifically from the LoggingHandler module",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flows observed; just imports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, secrets, or unusual code behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two import statements importing 'enable' and 'LoggingHandler' from a local module 'LoggingHandler'. There is no execution logic, data processing, or other operations that could indicate malicious intent. Import statements are standard in Python for modular code organization and do not inherently pose security risks. No suspicious patterns or anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import of logging-related components with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be part of a larger, benign codebase.",
