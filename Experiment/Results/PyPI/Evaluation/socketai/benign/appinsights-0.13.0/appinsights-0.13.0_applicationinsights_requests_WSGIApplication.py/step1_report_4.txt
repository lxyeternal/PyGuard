  "purpose": "This code provides a WSGI middleware wrapper to enable telemetry collection and reporting to Application Insights for existing Python web applications.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR', 'REMOTE_ADDR', 'QUERY_STRING', 'HTTP_HOST', 'SERVER_NAME', 'wsgi.url_scheme', 'REQUEST_METHOD', 'PATH_INFO'",
  "sinks": "TelemetryClient.track_request method, which sends telemetry data over the network; self.client.flush also sends data",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read to construct request metadata; data is passed to self.client.track_request which transmits telemetry to external service",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables for IP and URL construction is standard; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; no obfuscated code; no dynamic code execution detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward WSGI middleware that wraps an application to collect telemetry data. It extracts request info from environment variables, manages operation context with UUIDs, and reports request metrics via Application Insights SDK. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious data exfiltration. The use of environment variables for IP and URL is standard practice. The code does not perform any network connections, file manipulations, or data leaks beyond telemetry reporting, which is expected behavior. No obfuscated code or malicious logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as intended for telemetry purposes without any malicious behavior or security risks. It safely collects and reports request data to an external telemetry service, with no indications of malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling.",
