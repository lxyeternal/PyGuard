  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate SDK setup snippet that performs runtime patching of third-party library internals for customization purposes. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The low malware score (0), zero obfuscation (0), and a modest security risk score (0.2) are appropriate given the context."
