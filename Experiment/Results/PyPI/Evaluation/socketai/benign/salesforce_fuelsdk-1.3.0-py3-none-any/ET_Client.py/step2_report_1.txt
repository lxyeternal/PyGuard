  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Issues present?** No. The code only issues a warning and imports a module.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None identified.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0.1 (though code is not obfuscated), confidence=1.\n- **Comments:** The report is accurate; the code is benign, straightforward, and standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Issues present?** No. Same as above—warning and import.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0.\n- **Comments:** Correct assessment; no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Issues present?** No. Warning and import.\n- **Potential concern?** Slight mention that FuelSDK functions could handle untrusted data, but this is speculative.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.1 (due to potential use of FuelSDK functions), obfuscated=0.\n- **Justification for risk=0.1:** Since the code only imports FuelSDK, the actual risk depends on what FuelSDK does with data later. The code itself doesn't process data, so the risk is minimal but not zero if FuelSDK functions are later used insecurely.\n- **Comments:** The assessment is reasonable; the code is benign, but the overall security depends on FuelSDK's implementation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Issues present?** No. Warning and import.\n- **Potential concern?** Importing entire SDK can be risky if FuelSDK contains malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.3 (due to wildcard import), obfuscated=0.\n- **Justification for risk=0.3:** The wildcard import (`from FuelSDK import *`) can obscure which functions are used and potentially import malicious code if FuelSDK is compromised. However, the code snippet itself doesn't show malicious activity.\n- **Comments:** The risk score seems slightly high but justifiable given the import style.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Issues present?** No. Warning and import.\n- **Potential concern?** Similar to above—if FuelSDK is malicious or tampered with, importing it could be risky.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0.\n- **Justification:** Slightly lower risk than report 4, but still noting that the import could be problematic if FuelSDK is malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Assessment**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, and the code itself shows no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Generally low, but some reports assign moderate risk due to the import style and potential for compromised SDKs.\n\n### **My own evaluation:**\n\n- The code is purely a deprecation warning and a module import.\n- There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The main concern is the import of an external SDK (`FuelSDK`), especially with a wildcard import, which could pose security risks if the SDK is compromised or malicious.\n\n**Adjusted scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — Slight concern over wildcard import and dependency trust, but not a direct vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Justification:**\n\n- The code is standard for deprecation notices.\n- No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.\n- The only potential security concern is trusting the external SDK, which is outside the scope of this code snippet.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Score |\n|----------------|--------------|\n| Malware        | 0            |\n| Obfuscated     | 0            |\n| Security Risk  | 0.1          |\n\nThis reflects a benign code snippet with minimal security considerations primarily related to dependency trust rather than the code itself.",
