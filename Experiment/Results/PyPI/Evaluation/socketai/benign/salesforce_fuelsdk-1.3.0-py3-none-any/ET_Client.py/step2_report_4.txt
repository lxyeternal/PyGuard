  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Straightforward deprecation warning and import from FuelSDK. No suspicious activity.\n- **Findings:** The code is benign; no malware, obfuscation, or anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1; standard warning and import.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, no dynamic code, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** Slightly less (0.9), but still high.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Warning plus import, potential for further use of FuelSDK functions.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, but notes that FuelSDK functions could handle untrusted data, which might pose risks if FuelSDK is compromised.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — indicates minimal risk, which seems reasonable.\n- **Justification for risk score:** Since the code itself doesn't execute malicious code, but the imported SDK could be insecure, a small security risk score is justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. No changes necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Warning and wildcard import from FuelSDK; potential risks if FuelSDK contains malicious code.\n- **Findings:** The use of wildcard import (`from FuelSDK import *`) can be risky, as it obscures what is imported and could introduce insecure code if FuelSDK is compromised.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.3 — this is reasonable given the potential risks associated with wildcard imports.\n- **Note:** The report correctly identifies that the risk depends on FuelSDK's integrity, which is outside this snippet.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Warning and import, potential for malicious code if FuelSDK is tampered.\n- **Findings:** The code itself is benign, but the import could be risky if the package is malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — appropriate, considering the potential environment risk.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n- **Risk scores:** Generally low, reflecting the minimal inherent risk in such import and warning statements, with some variation based on potential environmental risks.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The code snippets are standard deprecation warnings with module imports, common in maintenance workflows.\n- The only notable concern is the use of wildcard import (`from FuelSDK import *`), which can be risky if FuelSDK is compromised. However, the reports correctly acknowledge this and assign a moderate risk score (0.3 or 0.2), which is appropriate.\n- No evidence suggests malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** — considering the potential risks of importing external SDKs, especially with wildcard imports, but nothing in the code snippet indicates active threats.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are reasonable given the code context. No significant changes are necessary.",
