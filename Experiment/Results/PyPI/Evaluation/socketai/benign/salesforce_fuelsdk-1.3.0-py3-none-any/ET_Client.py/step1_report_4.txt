{
  "purpose": "The code issues a deprecation warning for an older module and imports all contents from the FuelSDK module for legacy support.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'warnings' module and the 'FuelSDK' module.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing warnings to issuing a deprecation warning, then importing the FuelSDK module, which may contain additional functionality.",
  "anomalies": "The code itself is straightforward; however, importing the entire FuelSDK without restrictions can be risky if the SDK contains malicious or insecure code, but this cannot be determined from this snippet alone.",
  "analysis": "The code issues a deprecation warning indicating that the current module will be removed in the future and recommends using the FuelSDK module instead. It then proceeds to import all functions and classes from FuelSDK for legacy support. No malicious behavior or suspicious patterns are evident within this snippet. The use of a wildcard import can be risky in general, as it obscures which parts of the SDK are used and could potentially import malicious or insecure code if FuelSDK is compromised, but this risk depends on the SDK's integrity and is outside the scope of this code review.",
  "conclusion": "This code does not contain malicious behavior directly but could pose security risks if FuelSDK contains vulnerabilities or malicious code. The implementation appears standard for handling deprecated modules with legacy support. No indicators of malware are present in this snippet.",
