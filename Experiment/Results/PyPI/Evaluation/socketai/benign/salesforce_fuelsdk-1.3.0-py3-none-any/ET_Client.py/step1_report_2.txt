  "purpose": "The code issues a deprecation warning for a module and imports the FuelSDK module for legacy support.",
  "sources": "The warning message is hardcoded as a string; the import statement reads the FuelSDK module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed or output; the code does not write or transmit data externally.",
  "flows": "The code warns about future deprecation, then imports FuelSDK without any further data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only standard warning and import statements, with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code issues a DeprecationWarning with a static message, indicating planned removal of this module. The import statement brings in FuelSDK, a third-party library. There are no user inputs, no untrusted data, no dynamic code execution, or obfuscated logic. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple deprecation warning and import statement for legacy support, with no malicious behavior or security threats detected.",
