{
  "purpose": "To warn users about deprecated module usage and to import the FuelSDK module for legacy support.",
  "sources": "The warning message generated by warnings.warn and the import statement for FuelSDK.",
  "sinks": "The import statement could potentially load external or untrusted code if FuelSDK is maliciously tampered with or maliciously replaced in the environment.",
  "flows": "Warning message is issued when the module is imported; FuelSDK is imported directly, potentially executing malicious code if the package is compromised.",
  "anomalies": "The code issues a deprecation warning and continues to import a potentially outdated or vulnerable module. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code issues a DeprecationWarning to inform users about future removal of the current module. It then imports the FuelSDK module, which is necessary for legacy support. The warning is standard practice, and the import is straightforward. There are no signs of malicious intent, such as dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials, or data exfiltration. The only potential concern is if the FuelSDK module is malicious or tampered with in the environment, but this is outside the scope of this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily serves to warn about deprecated functionality and to maintain backward compatibility by importing FuelSDK. There are no indications of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks within this code snippet itself.",
