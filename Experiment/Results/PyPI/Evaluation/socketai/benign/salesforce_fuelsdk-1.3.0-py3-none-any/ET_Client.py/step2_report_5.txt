  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the reported issues, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Code Overview:**\n```python\nimport warnings\nwarnings.warn('Import the FuelSDK module instead. This module will be removed in the future.', DeprecationWarning)\n\n# For legacy support only.\n# Use FuelSDK module instead (Example: from FuelSDK import ET_Client)\nfrom FuelSDK import *\n```\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- The code issues a deprecation warning, informing users about future removal.\n- It imports all from `FuelSDK`, a third-party module, for backward compatibility.\n- No user input, dynamic code, or obfuscated logic.\n- No signs of malicious activity within this snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Warning + import for legacy support.\n- **Analysis:** Straightforward, no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard practice.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate; no issues here.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious activity; static warning and import.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Correct; no issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same, with mention of potential use of FuelSDK functions.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity; the code is simple.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, transitional support.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (slightly elevated due to potential risk if FuelSDK functions handle untrusted data).\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Reasonable; the slight increase in `securityRisk` reflects the potential concern if FuelSDK functions are insecure, but the code itself is safe.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Same purpose, with mention of wildcard import.\n- **Analysis:** The wildcard import (`from FuelSDK import *`) can be risky in general, as it can import malicious or insecure code if FuelSDK is compromised.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior evident; risk exists if FuelSDK is malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.3 (due to potential risks of wildcard import).\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n\n**Assessment:** The risk score seems appropriate; the code itself is benign, but the import method can pose security concerns if FuelSDK is compromised.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Warning + import, with concern about potential malicious tampering.\n- **Analysis:** The main concern is if FuelSDK is malicious or tampered with, as the import could execute malicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious code in snippet; the risk depends on environment.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (due to environment dependency).\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate; the code itself is safe, but environment risk exists.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign `0`. No evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly assign `0`. The code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Varies from 0 to 0.3. The highest concern is the wildcard import (`from FuelSDK import *`), which can be risky if FuelSDK is malicious or compromised.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\nConsidering all reports and the code snippet:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — 0.3 (mainly due to wildcard import and environment trust)\n\nThe risk score could be slightly higher if we consider the wildcard import a security concern, but since the code itself is benign, a score of 0.2 seems reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The current scores are appropriate.\n- The potential security concern is the import method, not the code logic.\n- No evidence suggests supply chain or malicious activity.\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.2-0.3 |\n\nThis aligns with the assessments and justifies the scores based on the code snippet and context.",
