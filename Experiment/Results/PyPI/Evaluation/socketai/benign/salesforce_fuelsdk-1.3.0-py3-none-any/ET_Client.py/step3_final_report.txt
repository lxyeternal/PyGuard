  "purpose": "Deprecation warning and import of FuelSDK for legacy support.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from FuelSDK import *' and the warning issued via warnings.warn.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of FuelSDK functions that could handle untrusted data or contain malicious code.",
  "flows": "Warning issued at the start; subsequent use of FuelSDK functions (not shown) could process data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import which can obscure imported functions and potentially introduce insecure code if FuelSDK is compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code issues a deprecation warning and imports all from FuelSDK, a third-party module. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution is present. The main concern is the import style, which could be risky if FuelSDK is malicious or compromised, but the code snippet itself remains benign. The malware score is correctly 0; the obfuscated score is 0; the security risk is modest (~0.2-0.3) due to the import method and dependency trust. Confidence is high (0.8-1) as the code is straightforward and standard for deprecation notices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a transitional support with a deprecation warning and a module import. The primary security consideration is the trustworthiness of the external FuelSDK package, not the code itself. The assigned scores are appropriate, with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The main risk stems from dependency trust and import style, which is acknowledged in the risk score (~0.2-0.3).",
