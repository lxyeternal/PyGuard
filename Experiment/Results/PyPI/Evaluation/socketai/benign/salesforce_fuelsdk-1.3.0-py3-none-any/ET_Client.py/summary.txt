  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a transitional support with a deprecation warning and a module import. The primary security consideration is the trustworthiness of the external FuelSDK package, not the code itself. The assigned scores are appropriate, with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The main risk stems from dependency trust and import style, which is acknowledged in the risk score (~0.2-0.3)."
