  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Issues Present?** No. The code is straightforward: a deprecation warning and an import.  \n- **Errors/Flaws?** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 1. These are appropriate given the benign nature.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident. The code is standard practice for deprecation notices.\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Issues Present?** No. Similar to Report 1, very straightforward.  \n- **Errors/Flaws?** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.9.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior detected; the code is a simple warning and import.\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Issues Present?** No. The code issues a warning and imports FuelSDK.  \n- **Errors/Flaws?** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.9.  \n- **Justification:** Slightly higher security risk score (0.1) due to potential issues if FuelSDK is compromised, but no direct malicious activity. The risk score reflects the potential risk if the imported SDK contains malicious code, not the code snippet itself.\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Issues Present?** No. The wildcard import (`from FuelSDK import *`) can be risky in general, but not malicious per se.  \n- **Errors/Flaws?** The report correctly notes the potential risk of importing the entire SDK without restrictions.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.3, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.8.  \n- **Justification:** The higher security risk score is justified due to the potential for malicious code within FuelSDK, especially since wildcard imports obscure what is being imported.\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Issues Present?** No. Similar to previous reports, warning plus import.  \n- **Errors/Flaws?** No.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.9.  \n- **Justification:** Slightly elevated risk score, reflecting the potential for malicious code if FuelSDK is compromised, but no direct evidence.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code in the snippet. The only potential concern is the imported SDK, which could be malicious, but the code itself does not contain malware.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate; the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk Score:** The scores vary from 0.1 to 0.3, reflecting the potential risk if FuelSDK is compromised. Given that the code is a simple warning and import, and no malicious activity is detected, these scores seem reasonable.\n\n- **Confidence Levels:** High confidence (0.8–1) across reports, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations\n\n- **Malware Score:** I agree with 0; no malicious activity is evident.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 is correct.\n\n- **Security Risk Score:** Given the potential for third-party SDKs to contain malicious code, a risk score of around **0.2** to **0.3** is justified, especially considering the wildcard import. The highest score (0.3) in Report 4 seems reasonable.\n\n- **Overall Malware & Obfuscation:** Both should remain at 0.\n\n- **Overall Risk:** Slightly elevated due to the import of an external SDK, but the code snippet itself is benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Score Type        | Final Estimated Score |\n|-------------------|------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0                      |\n| Obfuscated        | 0                      |\n| Security Risk     | 0.2 – 0.3              |\n\nThe existing scores in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature. No further escalation is necessary based on this snippet.",
