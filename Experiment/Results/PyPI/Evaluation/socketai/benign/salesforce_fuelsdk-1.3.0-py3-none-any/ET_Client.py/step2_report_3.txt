  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is a simple deprecation warning followed by an import statement (`from FuelSDK import *`).\n- No user input, no dynamic code, no obfuscated logic.\n- The code itself appears benign, serving as a transitional support for legacy code.\n- The only potential concern is the import of the entire FuelSDK module, which could, in theory, contain malicious code if compromised, but this cannot be inferred solely from this snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Warning + import for legacy support.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, straightforward.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent; no issues.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious activity, static warning, straightforward import.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate; no issues.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Warning + import.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, but notes that FuelSDK could be used maliciously after import.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly elevated securityRisk (0.1), which is reasonable given the potential risk if FuelSDK is compromised. The malware score remains zero, which is correct based on the code snippet.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Warning + import.\n- **Analysis:** Highlights that importing the SDK could be risky if the SDK contains malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.3, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.8.\n- **Assessment:** The securityRisk score is higher here, reflecting the potential risk of importing third-party code. This is reasonable.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Warning + import.\n- **Analysis:** Similar to above; warns about potential tampering or malicious SDK.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate; no malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n\n- **Malware score:** Consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Security risk:** Ranges from 0 to 0.3, depending on the potential risk of importing third-party code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- The code itself does **not** contain malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- The only concern is the import of `FuelSDK`, which could be malicious if the package is compromised, but this cannot be inferred from the code snippet alone.\n- The scores reflect this understanding, with malware=0 and securityRisk varying based on the potential risk of third-party SDKs.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0**, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated:** Remain at **0**.\n- **Risk score:** Given the reliance on third-party SDKs, a moderate risk score (around 0.2-0.3) is justified, especially considering supply chain concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is benign and standard for deprecation notices.\n- The potential security concern is the trustworthiness of the FuelSDK package, which is outside the scope of this code snippet.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---|---|---|\n| **0** | **0** | **0.2** |\n\nThis reflects that the code is safe in isolation but acknowledges the inherent risk in importing third-party modules.",
