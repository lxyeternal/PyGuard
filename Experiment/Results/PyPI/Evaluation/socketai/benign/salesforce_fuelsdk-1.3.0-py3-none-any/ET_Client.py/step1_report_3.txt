{
  "purpose": "The code issues a deprecation warning for the current module and imports the FuelSDK module for legacy support.",
  "sources": "The warnings.warn() function call, the import statement for FuelSDK",
  "sinks": "Potential use of FuelSDK functions and classes after import",
  "flows": "The warning is issued during import, and the FuelSDK module is imported for further use, potentially involving untrusted data if FuelSDK functions handle such",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only standard warning and import statements, no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscation or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The script issues a deprecation warning indicating the current module will be removed and suggests using FuelSDK directly. It then imports the FuelSDK module, which is a third-party library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, system modification, or hidden backdoors. The code is straightforward, serving a transitional purpose for legacy support.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a transitional support script that warns users about deprecation and imports a third-party SDK. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
