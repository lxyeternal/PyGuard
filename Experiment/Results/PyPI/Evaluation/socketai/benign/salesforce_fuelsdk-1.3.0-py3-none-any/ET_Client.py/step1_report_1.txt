{
  "purpose": "The code is a warning and import statement related to the FuelSDK module, providing a deprecation notice and encouraging use of a different module for future compatibility.",
  "sources": "The warnings.warn() call indicating deprecation, and the import statement importing everything from FuelSDK.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks in the code; it only issues a warning and imports a module.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves issuing a deprecation warning and then importing the FuelSDK module, which may contain additional code not shown here.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with standard deprecation warning and import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code issues a DeprecationWarning to inform users about future removal of the current module. It then imports all contents from FuelSDK. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. The import is standard for Python modules. The warning serves to guide users towards a new module but does not introduce security risks itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical deprecation notice with a module import and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It is a benign, standard practice to maintain backward compatibility while guiding users toward updated modules.",
