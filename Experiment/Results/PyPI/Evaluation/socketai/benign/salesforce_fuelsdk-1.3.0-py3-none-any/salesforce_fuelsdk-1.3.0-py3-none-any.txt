      "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a transitional support with a deprecation warning and a module import. The primary security consideration is the trustworthiness of the external FuelSDK package, not the code itself. The assigned scores are appropriate, with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The main risk stems from dependency trust and import style, which is acknowledged in the risk score (~0.2-0.3)."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate SDK setup snippet that performs runtime patching of third-party library internals for customization purposes. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The low malware score (0), zero obfuscation (0), and a modest security risk score (0.2) are appropriate given the context."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard SDK wrapper for Salesforce Marketing Cloud APIs. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The security risk is minimal, consistent with SDK code, and scores of 0 for malware and obfuscation are appropriate. The overall risk score should be set around 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting low inherent risk without vulnerabilities."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate SDK client with standard practices, but it contains insecure placeholder credentials in SOAP headers and minimal insecure handling of WSDL files. These are configuration issues rather than malicious behaviors. The malware score is correctly 0, obfuscation is absent, and the security risk score of approximately 0.2-0.3 reflects these insecure practices but not active malicious intent."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a typical, well-structured SDK for API interactions with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low malware score (0) and obfuscation score (0) are justified. The security risk score (~0.2) reflects potential injection vulnerabilities if inputs are not sanitized, but this is not malicious activity. Overall, the code is safe for use in production, assuming proper input validation is implemented externally."
