{
  "purpose": "The code constructs and appends XML Content objects to SOAP message elements, and builds message bodies based on method parameters for SOAP requests.",
  "sources": "Reads data from Content.value (via get()), method arguments (args and kwargs), and class attributes related to SOAP message structure.",
  "sinks": "XML element modifications through setText() and append(), setting namespace prefixes with setPrefix().",
  "flows": "Data flows from method parameters and Content objects into XML nodes via append() and setText(), forming the SOAP message structure.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or network activity; standard XML handling routines.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical SOAP message assembly, appending Content-derived elements and setting properties. It does not perform network operations, data exfiltration, or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are present. The low malware and security risk scores are justified by the benign, standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation for SOAP message construction, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities detected. The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
