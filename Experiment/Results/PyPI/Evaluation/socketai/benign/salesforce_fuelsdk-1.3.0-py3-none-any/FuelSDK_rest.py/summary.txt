  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, well-structured SDK for API interactions with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low malware score (0) and obfuscation score (0) are justified. The security risk score (~0.2) reflects potential injection vulnerabilities if inputs are not sanitized, but this is not malicious activity. Overall, the code is safe for use in production, assuming proper input validation is implemented externally."
