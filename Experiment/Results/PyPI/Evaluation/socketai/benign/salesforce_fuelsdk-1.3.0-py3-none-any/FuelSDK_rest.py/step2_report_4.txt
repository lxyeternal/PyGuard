  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary & Findings:** The report states that the code is a standard SDK wrapper for SOAP and REST APIs, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage. It notes that response parsing is straightforward, and no malicious payloads are evident. The primary concern is lack of input validation, but this is not malicious.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is a typical SDK, with no evidence of malicious activity. The low security risk score aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary & Findings:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard API interactions, no malicious behavior, no backdoors, and no obfuscation. The confidence is high, and scores are consistent.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. No issues found.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary & Findings:** Again, the code is a comprehensive wrapper with no signs of malicious activity. The analysis confirms no exfiltration, code injection, or sabotage.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is justified; the code appears benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary & Findings:** The code is a standard client library for web service interactions, with no malicious behavior or sabotage. The main concern is potential misuse due to lack of sanitization, but no malicious intent is detected.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary & Findings:** The code is a comprehensive API wrapper with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The reasoning is consistent, and the low risk score reflects that.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n\n---\n\n**Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the analysis. The code is a standard SDK for API interactions, with no evidence of malicious payloads, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, which is correct; no obfuscation is present.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 or 0.2), reflecting minimal security concerns mainly due to lack of input validation, but not malicious.\n\n**Challenging Assumptions & Validity:**\n\n- The core logic in all reports is consistent: the code is a typical SDK wrapper with no malicious intent or sabotage.\n\n- No claims are based on unwarranted assumptions; the reasoning is sound.\n\n- The scores are reasonable and aligned with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated Score:** **0**  \n**Risk Score:** **0.2** (slightly higher but justified due to lack of input sanitization)\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe code is a standard API SDK, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage. The primary concern is potential misuse due to lack of validation, but this does not constitute malicious behavior. The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and justified. The code appears benign, with no malware or obfuscation. The overall security posture is low risk, with a minor concern about input validation.",
