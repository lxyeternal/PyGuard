{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes for interacting with SOAP and REST web services, managing request and response handling, object creation, updating, deletion, and pagination for a platform like Salesforce Marketing Cloud.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for API requests, response objects from web service calls, environment variables for tokens and URLs.",
  "sinks": "Request payloads, URL parameters, response parsing, class attributes storing response data.",
  "flows": "Input parameters influence URL construction, request payloads, and response parsing; response data is stored in class attributes for further use.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. Response parsing uses broad exception handling which could mask malformed responses but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard SDK wrapper for SOAP and REST APIs, with functions for object management and data retrieval. It does not contain obfuscation, malicious payloads, or sabotage. Response handling is straightforward, with minimal validation, which could be a security concern if inputs are malicious, but this is typical for SDKs. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code are present. The dynamic URL and payload construction from user inputs could pose injection risks if inputs are malicious, but no active malicious activity is detected. The code's structure and behavior suggest benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, well-structured SDK for API interactions with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low malware score (0) and obfuscation score (0) are justified. The security risk score (~0.2) reflects potential injection vulnerabilities if inputs are not sanitized, but this is not malicious activity. Overall, the code is safe for use in production, assuming proper input validation is implemented externally.",
