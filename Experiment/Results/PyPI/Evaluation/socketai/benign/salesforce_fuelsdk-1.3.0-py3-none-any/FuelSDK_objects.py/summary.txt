  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard SDK wrapper for Salesforce Marketing Cloud APIs. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The security risk is minimal, consistent with SDK code, and scores of 0 for malware and obfuscation are appropriate. The overall risk score should be set around 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting low inherent risk without vulnerabilities."
