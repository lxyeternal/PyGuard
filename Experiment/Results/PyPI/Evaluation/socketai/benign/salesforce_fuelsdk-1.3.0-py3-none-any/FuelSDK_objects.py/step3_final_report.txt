  "purpose": "SDK wrappers for Salesforce Marketing Cloud (ExactTarget) APIs, managing content, folders, campaigns, events, and related entities.",
  "sources": "Class attributes such as 'props', 'columns', 'Name', 'CustomerKey', and method parameters used to construct API request payloads.",
  "sinks": "API request functions like ET_Post, ET_Patch, ET_Delete, ET_Get, ET_Describe, ET_Configure, which send data to external services.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class properties and method inputs into API request payloads, which are then transmitted via SDK functions to external endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Code structure is consistent with standard SDK wrappers.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of object-oriented wrappers around Salesforce Marketing Cloud API endpoints, performing CRUD and event operations. It reads data from class attributes and method parameters, then constructs and sends API requests via functions like ET_Post, ET_Patch, etc. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The code appears to be a legitimate SDK implementation for managing marketing assets and data. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are detected. The design is typical for SDK wrappers, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard SDK wrapper for Salesforce Marketing Cloud APIs. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The security risk is minimal, consistent with SDK code, and scores of 0 for malware and obfuscation are appropriate. The overall risk score should be set around 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting low inherent risk without vulnerabilities.",
