  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, focusing on the presence of issues, reasoning, scores, and consistency.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n**Purpose:** SDK for interacting with a web service API, handling auth, WSDL, and operations like subscriber addition.\n\n**Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Configuration files, environment variables, JWT/OAuth tokens, network requests, file I/O, SOAP headers.\n\n**Anomalies & Analysis:**\n- Uses a hardcoded default WSDL URL and static cache filename.\n- WSDL retrieval writes content without validation.\n- Security headers for SOAP use placeholder credentials ('*'), which is suspicious and insecure.\n- Sensitive info like tokens and secrets are handled via environment/config, but the security setup in SOAP headers is questionable.\n- No malicious code or obfuscation detected.\n- The logic appears standard, but the insecure SOAP security headers are a concern.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nNo active malware, but insecure SOAP security setup (dummy credentials) and questionable token handling. These are configuration issues, not malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Security risk: 0.3 (moderate due to insecure headers)  \n- Overall risk: justified as moderate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n**Purpose:** SDK for web service API, OAuth2, WSDL management, subscriber/data extension management.\n\n**Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Config/env/params, network requests, token management, WSDL caching.\n\n**Anomalies & Analysis:**\n- No evidence of malicious code or backdoors.\n- Handles sensitive data securely, follows standard patterns.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious network activity.\n- The code is typical for such SDKs.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nLegitimate SDK client, very low malware risk.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security risk: 0.2 (low, standard practices)  \n- Justified.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n**Purpose:** Client for Salesforce Marketing Cloud, handling auth, WSDL, and API interactions.\n\n**Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Config/env/params, network requests, JWT tokens, WSDL retrieval.\n\n**Anomalies & Analysis:**\n- No malicious code or backdoors.\n- Uses environment/config for credentials.\n- Dynamic WSDL retrieval and caching.\n- Minor concerns: appending 'legacy=1' to auth URL without validation, and placeholder security tokens in SOAP headers ('*').\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nStandard SDK client, no malicious activity. The placeholder credentials are a concern but not malicious.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security risk: 0.2 (due to placeholder credentials)  \n- Justified.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n**Purpose:** SDK for marketing web service, handling tokens, WSDL, SOAP setup.\n\n**Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Config/env/params, network requests, token refresh, WSDL retrieval.\n\n**Anomalies & Analysis:**\n- No hardcoded secrets or backdoors.\n- Typical OAuth2 and WSDL management.\n- No suspicious patterns.\n- External requests and file I/O are standard.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nLegitimate SDK setup, no malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security risk: 0.2  \n- Justified.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n**Purpose:** Client for Salesforce Marketing Cloud, managing auth, WSDL, API calls.\n\n**Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Config/env/params, network requests, token handling, WSDL caching.\n\n**Anomalies & Analysis:**\n- Uses static filename 'ExactTargetWSDL.xml'.\n- Writes server response directly to file without validation.\n- Security headers set with dummy credentials ('*', '*'), which is suspicious.\n- No obfuscation or malicious code detected.\n- Overall pattern is typical SDK behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nNo malicious activity, but the placeholder credentials in SOAP headers and insecure WSDL handling are concerns. These seem like placeholders or misconfigurations, not malicious.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security risk: 0.2 (due to placeholder security tokens)  \n- Justified.\n\n---\n\n## Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** All reports indicate no malware or malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated:** None of the reports detect obfuscated code.  \n- **Security risk:** The main concern across reports is insecure or placeholder security credentials ('*') in SOAP headers and the handling of WSDL files without validation. These are configuration/security issues, not malware.\n\n---\n\n## Final Recommendations:\n\n- The malware score should **remain at 0** for all reports, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- The obfuscated score should **remain at 0**.\n- The security risk scores, which hover around 0.2-0.3, are appropriate given the insecure placeholder credentials and WSDL handling practices.\n- The reasoning in the reports aligns with these scores.\n\n---\n\n## My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security risk:** 0.2-0.3 (due to placeholder credentials and insecure WSDL handling, but no active exploits or malicious intent)  \n\nThe code appears to be legitimate SDK code with some insecure configuration practices that should be addressed but are not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are consistent in indicating no malware or obfuscation. The security scores are justified based on the insecure handling of credentials and WSDL files, but these are not malicious behaviors. The overall risk is low, and the code is typical for SDK clients interacting with external services.",
