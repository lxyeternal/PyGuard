  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate SDK client with standard practices, but it contains insecure placeholder credentials in SOAP headers and minimal insecure handling of WSDL files. These are configuration issues rather than malicious behaviors. The malware score is correctly 0, obfuscation is absent, and the security risk score of approximately 0.2-0.3 reflects these insecure practices but not active malicious intent."
