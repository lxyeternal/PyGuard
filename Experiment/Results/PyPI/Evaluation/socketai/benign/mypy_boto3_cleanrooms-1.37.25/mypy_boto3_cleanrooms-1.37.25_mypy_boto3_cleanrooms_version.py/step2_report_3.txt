  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior:**\n   - The code is a straightforward assignment of a version string (`\"1.37.25\"`) to the variable `__version__`.\n   - It contains only a comment with copyright info.\n   - There are no inputs, external data sources, dynamic code, or interactions.\n   - No obfuscation, no complex logic, no code execution beyond static assignment.\n   - No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks.\n\n2. **Assessment of the Reports:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple version declaration.\n   - They uniformly conclude that there are no anomalies, suspicious constructs, or malicious intent.\n   - The confidence levels are all at 1, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0 in all cases, aligning with the absence of obfuscation.\n   - Malware scores are all 0, consistent with no malicious activity detected or suggested.\n   - Security risk scores are 0, which makes sense given the benign nature of the code.\n\n3. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - Since all reports are consistent and accurate, no adjustments are necessary.\n   - The code is a standard pattern for version declaration in Python packages.\n   - The only minor note is the copyright year being in the future (2025), but this is a comment and does not impact security or functionality.\n\n4. **Final Evaluation:**\n   - **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n   - **Obfuscated score:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n   - **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign, standard version declaration with no security concerns. All reports correctly identify this. No changes to scores or reasoning are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's actual behavior and the analysis provided.",
