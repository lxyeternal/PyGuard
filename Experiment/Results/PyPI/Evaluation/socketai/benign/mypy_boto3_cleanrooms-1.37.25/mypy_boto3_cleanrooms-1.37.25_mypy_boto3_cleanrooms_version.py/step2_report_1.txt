  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if the reported issues are present in the code**\n\nAll reports agree that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`, with no dynamic or external inputs. The code snippet is minimal and straightforward, with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or complex logic. Therefore, the core issues described are accurate: the code is benign.\n\n**Step 2: Identify and record errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. They correctly identify that the code is a standard version declaration.\n- No errors or flawed reasoning are evident; the reports are thorough and cautious, emphasizing the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned to each issue**\n\n- All reports assign:\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n  - `confidence`: 1\n\n- These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.\n\n**Step 4: Justify any risk score higher than 0.5**\n\n- Since all reports assign a `securityRisk` of 0, and the code is straightforward, there is no justification for raising the risk score.\n- The `malware` score is also 0, aligning with the analysis.\n\n**Step 5: Pay attention to malware score**\n\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct. No malicious activity is detected or implied.\n\n**Step 6: Challenge any claims based on assumptions**\n\n- All claims are based on static analysis and logical reasoning, not assumptions. They correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n**Step 7: Ensure scores are consistent with the report**\n\n- The scores are consistent and appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard, static version declaration with no malicious or suspicious behavior.**\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- The code is a simple assignment statement, common in many packages.\n- No external inputs, dynamic code, or suspicious constructs.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or data leaks.\n- The copyright date being in the future (2025) is likely a typo or placeholder, not a security concern.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately.",
