  "purpose": "Declare the package version as a static string in __version__.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of version string to __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no external inputs or outputs.",
  "flows": "N/A - static assignment with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a future year (2025) in comment, but no functional anomaly.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static assignment of a version string to __version__, with only a comment indicating copyright. No dynamic code, external data, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature. The version string is straightforward, and the code contains no suspicious behavior or security risks. The future date in the comment is likely a typo or placeholder, not a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious or security issues. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
