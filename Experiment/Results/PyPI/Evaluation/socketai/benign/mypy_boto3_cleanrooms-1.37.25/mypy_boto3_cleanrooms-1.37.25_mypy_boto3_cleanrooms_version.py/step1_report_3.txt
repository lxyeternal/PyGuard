  "analysis": "The code only sets a version string and includes a copyright notice. There are no inputs, no code execution, no data leaks, no dynamic code, or suspicious constructs. The code is simple, static, and standard for defining a package version.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard, safe practice for package versioning.",
