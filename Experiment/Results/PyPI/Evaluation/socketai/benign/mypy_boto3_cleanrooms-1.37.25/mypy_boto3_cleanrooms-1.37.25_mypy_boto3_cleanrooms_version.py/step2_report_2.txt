  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to the `__version__` variable.\n   - The code is minimal, static, and contains only a comment and a single assignment statement.\n   - No inputs, external data sources, dynamic code, or complex logic are present.\n   - The copyright year (2025) is a future date, but it's only a comment and does not impact code behavior.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior & Risks:**\n   - None of the reports find any suspicious or malicious constructs.\n   - No obfuscation, backdoors, or data leaks are present.\n   - The code does not perform any network operations, file I/O, or dynamic execution.\n\n3. **Scores & Justifications:**\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the benign nature.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity and lack of vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Flaws in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - No overestimations or underestimations are evident.\n   - The reasoning is sound; no assumptions about vulnerabilities are made without evidence.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - The code is standard for version declaration in Python packages.\n   - No indication of malicious intent or malicious behavior.\n   - The only minor note is the future copyright year, but it's irrelevant to security.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n\n- The current scores are appropriate and justified.\n- No changes are necessary.\n- The overall risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at **0**.\n- The confidence level of 1 is justified, given the simplicity and clarity.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type        | Final Score | Justification                                              |\n|-------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0            | No malicious activity or code behavior detected.            |\n| Obfuscated        | 0            | Code is clear, straightforward, and un-obfuscated.          |\n| Security Risk     | 0            | No vulnerabilities or risky behavior present.               |\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis code is a standard, benign version declaration with no security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scores reflect the actual risk profile.",
