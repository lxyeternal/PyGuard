  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - There are no inputs, external data sources, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - No evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors.\n   - The code is minimal and standard for version declaration.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - No errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n   - They correctly note the absence of suspicious constructs or malicious intent.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - All reports assign a `securityRisk` of 0, which is justified.\n   - No reason exists to increase this score; the code poses no security threat.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports assign `malware`: 0, which is correct.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No questionable assumptions are made.\n   - The conclusions are based on straightforward static analysis.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risk present.\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a standard version declaration, with no dynamic elements, no external data handling, and no suspicious behavior. The comments and structure are typical for such a purpose.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. No modifications to the scores are necessary. The code is safe, benign, and standard.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my evaluation:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
