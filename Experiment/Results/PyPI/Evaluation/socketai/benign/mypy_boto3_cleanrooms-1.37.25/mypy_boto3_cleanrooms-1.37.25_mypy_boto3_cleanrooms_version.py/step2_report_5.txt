  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- No external inputs, data flows, or interactions are present.\n- No suspicious or malicious constructs are detected.\n- The code is straightforward, static, and typical for version declaration.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- All reports assign the version string `'1.37.25'` to `__version__`.\n- The copyright year is 2025, which is in the future relative to the data cutoff (October 2023). While unusual, it's not inherently malicious or suspicious—could be a typo or a placeholder.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, malware, or security risks are identified.\n\n**Scores:**\n- All reports assign `malware=0`, which is consistent with the analysis.\n- The `obfuscated` score is 0, which is appropriate.\n- The `securityRisk` score is 0, aligning with the benign nature of the code.\n- The confidence score is 1, reflecting high certainty that the code is safe.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- The only minor point is the future year in the comment, but it does not impact security or functionality.\n- No reason to adjust scores; all evidence points to benign code.\n\n**My overall assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a standard, safe version declaration with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Keep scores as they are.\n- No further action needed.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward version string assignment with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements. The reports correctly reflect this.",
