{
  "purpose": "The code defines static, type-annotated paginator classes for the boto3 'cleanrooms' client, facilitating structured pagination with documentation links.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and method signatures that unpack parameters into boto3 paginator calls; no external or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "Methods only define pagination behavior; no data sinks or external communication.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow; source-to-sink paths are absent as the code is static and structural.",
  "anomalies": "No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns; straightforward class inheritance and type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static class definitions for various paginator types, each with a 'paginate' method that unpacks input parameters. It imports type definitions and uses conditional imports for compatibility. The code is well-documented with links to boto3 and boto3-stubs documentation. No runtime logic, external data handling, or dynamic code execution is present. The structure aligns with standard SDK wrapper patterns, with no signs of malicious or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, static set of type annotations and class definitions for boto3's 'cleanrooms' paginators. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements. All evidence indicates it is safe and intended for static type checking and documentation purposes.",
