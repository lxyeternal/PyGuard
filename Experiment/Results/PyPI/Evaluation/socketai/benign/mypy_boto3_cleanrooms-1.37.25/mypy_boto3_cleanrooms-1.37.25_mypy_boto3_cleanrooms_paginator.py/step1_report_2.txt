{
  "purpose": "This code provides type annotations and paginator class definitions for the AWS boto3 cleanrooms service client, facilitating static type checking and structured pagination.",
  "sources": "Code reads input parameters via function arguments in 'paginate' methods, and imports data type definitions from '.type_defs'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that handle untrusted data or perform insecure operations are present. No network connections, file writes, or command executions are visible.",
  "flows": "The 'paginate' methods accept untrusted keyword arguments, which are unpacked into data type definitions; however, these are for static type checking and not runtime execution.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code primarily consists of class definitions and type annotations aligned with boto3 documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple paginator classes inheriting from a generic 'Paginator' base, with 'paginate' methods using 'Unpack' to specify input types. All class methods simply override 'paginate' to provide type hints; no dynamic code execution, network operations, or suspicious logic exists. The import statements and class structures are consistent with standard type-annotated SDK wrappers. No signs of malicious payloads, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured type-annotated wrapper for boto3 paginators, intended for static type checking and code completion support. There are no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated/malicious code. It is a standard code for SDK type definitions.",
