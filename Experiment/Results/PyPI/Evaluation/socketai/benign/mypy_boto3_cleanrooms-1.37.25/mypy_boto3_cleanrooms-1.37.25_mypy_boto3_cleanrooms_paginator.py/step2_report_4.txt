  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Describes the code as defining paginators for boto3's cleanrooms client, with documentation links.\n- **Sources:** Static code reading, no untrusted input.\n- **Sinks:** None—no data processing or external side effects.\n- **Flows:** No source-to-sink data flows; methods only define pagination interfaces.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- **Analysis:** The code is a straightforward, well-structured set of class definitions with type annotations, inheritance, and documentation. It does not perform any runtime data manipulation or external communication.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, static SDK wrapper code. No malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware/Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing static type annotations, class inheritance, and no runtime data handling.\n- **Analysis:** The code only defines class structures and method signatures for static type checking; no dynamic or malicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard, legitimate SDK type annotations.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware/Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on the code's role in facilitating static type safety, imports, and class inheritance.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, no dynamic code, no external data processing.\n- **Conclusion:** Purely structural, safe, and standard.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n- **Malware/Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar assessment: defines paginator classes with type annotations, no runtime logic, no external data handling.\n- **Analysis:** Clear pattern of static SDK wrapper code, no malicious signals.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard boilerplate code.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware/Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Emphasizes that the code is boilerplate, with no external or user input, no data transformation, and no suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis:** All signs point to purely structural code for static typing support.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n- **Malware/Obfuscated:** 0\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Issues present in code:** None. The code is static, type-annotated class definitions for AWS SDK paginators.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None detected; the code is consistent and adheres to standard patterns.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which is appropriate given the static, structural nature of the code.\n- **Risk scores:** All are very low, reflecting no security concerns.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None; the code does not process untrusted data at runtime, nor does it perform any external operations.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior observed)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Overall:** The code is a legitimate, well-structured set of type annotations and class definitions for AWS boto3 paginators, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**If I were to assign my own scores based on this review:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
