{
  "purpose": "Provide type annotations and paginators for the AWS 'cleanrooms' service client, facilitating type-safe iteration over paginated API responses.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type definitions; all source data is standard library, third-party libraries, or type definitions.",
  "sinks": "Paginator class methods that handle input parameters for API calls; no sinks process untrusted or external data directly, only method signatures and type annotations.",
  "flows": "Paginator classes' 'paginate' methods accept parameters (unpacked from type definitions) and return PageIterator objects; no external data flow from untrusted sources into sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. The code strictly defines type-safe paginator classes based on AWS SDK documentation; no malicious or unusual code behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple paginator classes for AWS 'cleanrooms' service, leveraging type annotations, conditional imports for compatibility, and standard class inheritance patterns. The methods only declare interfaces for paginating AWS API responses. No dynamic code execution, external data processing, or suspicious activities are present. The focus is on type safety and code structure, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of paginators for an AWS SDK client, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It strictly adheres to AWS SDK documentation and type safety practices.",
