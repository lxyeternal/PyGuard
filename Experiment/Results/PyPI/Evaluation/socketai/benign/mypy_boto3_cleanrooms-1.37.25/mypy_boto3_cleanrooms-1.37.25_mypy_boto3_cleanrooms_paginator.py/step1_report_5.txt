  "purpose": "Define paginator classes for various AWS CleanRooms service operations, enabling iteration over paginated API responses.",
  "sources": "Import statements for system info, type annotations, and AWS botocore paginators. Class definitions including paginate methods with **kwargs. No external or user input sources.",
  "sinks": "The paginate methods accept **kwargs for pagination parameters, which are passed directly to the underlying Paginator's paginate method. No other sinks or external data effects observed.",
  "flows": "The class methods receive input parameters via **kwargs, which are unpacked into the Paginator.paginate method, returning a PageIterator. No data transformations or untrusted data processing beyond this.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be boilerplate class definitions for paginators with no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behaviors. Use of type annotations and conditional imports is standard. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up typed paginator classes for AWS service calls, providing type safety and structured pagination. All methods are straightforward wrappers around the boto3 paginator, with type annotations for better static analysis. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or harmful behaviors. The purpose is solely to facilitate paginated API responses in a safe, structured manner.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard boilerplate for paginator classes with appropriate typing and documentation links. No malicious intent or security risks are evident. It functions as a type-safe wrapper around existing AWS SDK paginators, with no suspicious or harmful logic.",
