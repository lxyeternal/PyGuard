  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes the code as defining typed paginator classes for boto3's cleanrooms client, with documentation links. The code is static, importing type definitions and defining classes.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or side effects; methods only define pagination behavior.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns. The code is straightforward class definitions with type annotations.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code appears legitimate, with high confidence (1), no obfuscation (0), no malware (0), and no security risk (0).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is a well-structured, static set of class definitions for boto3 paginators, with no malicious behavior.\n- The analysis confirms no dynamic code, external data processing, or security issues.\n- Confidence is high (1), obfuscated (0), malware (0).\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on the code's purpose as providing type annotations and structured paginator classes.\n- Notes that the code only unpacks parameters into boto3 paginator calls, with no external or untrusted data processed.\n- No suspicious patterns or obfuscation; purely static type definitions.\n- Confidence slightly below 1 (0.95), but still very high, with no malware or security risks.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar assessment: boilerplate class definitions for paginators, with no malicious activity.\n- The code is purely structural, with no runtime logic beyond method signatures.\n- Confidence at 1, no obfuscation or malware.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Also describes the code as boilerplate, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- Emphasizes that the code is straightforward, with no dynamic or external data processing.\n- Confidence at 0.95, no malware or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code Content:** All reports agree that the code is static, defining paginator classes with type annotations for boto3's cleanrooms client.\n- **Malicious Indicators:** None of the reports identify any malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Obfuscation & Malware:** Scores are consistently 0, which aligns with the static, straightforward nature of the code.\n- **Security Risks:** None are evident; the code is purely structural and documentation-oriented.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n### Justification:\nThe code is a standard, well-structured set of type-annotated classes for paginating AWS API responses. It does not execute any untrusted code, handle untrusted data at runtime, or contain any hidden behaviors. All evidence points to it being legitimate SDK type definitions.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's static, documentation-oriented nature.",
