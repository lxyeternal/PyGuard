{
  "purpose": "This module defines type annotations and paginator classes for the AWS 'cleanrooms' service client, providing structured and typed access to paginated API responses.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type definitions; the code reads class definitions, method signatures, and type annotations.",
  "sinks": "The only data flow involving external input is through method parameters in 'paginate' functions, which accept untrusted keyword arguments for pagination controls.",
  "flows": "User code calls 'paginate' methods with parameters; these parameters are used internally by boto3 to fetch data. No untrusted data is processed or transmitted elsewhere within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors detected. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or hidden behaviors. The code adheres to standard type annotations and class inheritance patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines paginator classes with type annotations for a specific AWS service, leveraging conditional imports for compatibility, and creating subclasses for each paginator with method signatures. It imports necessary modules, declares type aliases based on Python version, and structures class definitions with no runtime logic beyond method signatures. There is no execution of external code, dynamic code evaluation, or data manipulation. All parts conform to expected patterns for SDK type definitions, and there are no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, type-annotated set of paginator class definitions for AWS SDK, with no evidence of malicious or harmful behavior. It is purely structural, intended to facilitate type-safe use of the boto3 'cleanrooms' client, and contains no malicious signals.",
