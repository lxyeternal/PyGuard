{
  "purpose": "This code defines paginators for the boto3 cleanrooms client, providing structured classes for iterating over paginated API responses with type annotations and documentation links.",
  "sources": "The code reads no untrusted input; it imports static modules and type definitions, and uses class methods for API pagination.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or perform side effects such as network communication, file writing, or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows indicating malicious activity; the class methods only define pagination behavior with no data manipulation or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code primarily consists of class definitions, type annotations, and documentation links. No obfuscated code features or dynamic code execution are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically defines paginator classes for the boto3 client with clear inheritance patterns, type annotations, and documentation links for each paginator. It uses conditional imports based on Python version for type checking and typing extensions, which is standard. There are no signs of malicious logic, hidden code, or security breaches. All code is static and solely for defining paginators.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured set of paginator class definitions intended to improve type safety and documentation for boto3 cleanrooms client pagination. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are evident.",
