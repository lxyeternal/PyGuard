{
  "purpose": "The script sets up the Python package 'mypy-boto3-cleanrooms' with metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description, imports setup from setuptools, and defines package metadata.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes to external systems or executes untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Reads file content for long description; passes static metadata to setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No dynamic execution or obfuscated parts. The dependencies are standard and explicitly specified.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, with static metadata and configuration parameters. It imports standard libraries, reads a README file, and invokes setup() with predefined arguments. There are no signs of malicious code, hidden behavior, or external network activity. The dependencies are explicitly listed, and no user input or untrusted data is processed. Overall, the script appears benign, focused solely on package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no malicious behavior or security issues. It contains no suspicious logic, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It is safe and appropriate for use in package distribution.",
