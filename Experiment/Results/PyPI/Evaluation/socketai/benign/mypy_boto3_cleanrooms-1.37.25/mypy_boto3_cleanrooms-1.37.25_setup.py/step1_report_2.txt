  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package named 'mypy-boto3-cleanrooms'. It prepares package metadata, dependencies, and distribution settings.",
  "sources": "Reads the content of README.md file for long_description; reads metadata fields like name, version, author, etc.; reads install_requires list for dependencies.",
  "targets": "No untrusted data sources; all inputs are static or file reads within the package directory.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; static data is used to configure package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected. The script appears straightforward and standard for Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, reads a README file for description, and calls setuptools.setup() with static package metadata and configuration. All data used appears static or from trusted sources. No user input, network operations, or dynamic code execution is present. No obfuscation or malicious patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely defines package metadata and dependencies in a conventional manner.",
