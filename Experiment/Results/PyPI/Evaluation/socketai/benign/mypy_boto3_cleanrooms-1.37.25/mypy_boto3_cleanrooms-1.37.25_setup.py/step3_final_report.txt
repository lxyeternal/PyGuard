  "purpose": "The script is a standard Python package setup script that configures package metadata, reads a README file for description, and specifies dependencies and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file for long description; static metadata defined within the script.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or file writing beyond reading the README.md file.",
  "flows": "Static data flows from local file and hardcoded strings into the setup() function; no dynamic or untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious patterns present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup script with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or user input. It uses only standard libraries and explicit, static metadata. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. All signals indicate benign behavior, consistent with typical package configuration scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and security threats. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and justified.",
