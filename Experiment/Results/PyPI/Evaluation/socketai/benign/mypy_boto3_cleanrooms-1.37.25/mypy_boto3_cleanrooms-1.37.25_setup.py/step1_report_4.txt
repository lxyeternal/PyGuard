{
  "purpose": "The script sets up and configures the Python package 'mypy-boto3-cleanrooms' for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long_description, reads package data, and uses hardcoded package and version info.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes untrusted input or outputs sensitive data; it mainly configures package metadata.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; setup parameters are hardcoded or file-based.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code uses standard setup procedures. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, reads a Markdown file for long description, and calls setup() with package metadata. All values appear to be static, well-formed, and typical for a setup script. No dynamic code execution, external data fetching, or suspicious constructs are present. The package data, dependencies, and URLs are standard and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks.",
