  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-cleanrooms package, used for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md file for long description; imports setup from setuptools; no other input sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no dynamic code execution, network calls, or file writing beyond standard setup procedures.",
  "flows": "Reads static files and passes static data to setup(), with no untrusted input or data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward setup script, no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code segments.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python setup configuration for a package, importing required modules, reading a README file for description, and calling setup() with static parameters. It does not contain any code that dynamically executes untrusted data, connects to external sources, or includes suspicious patterns. No signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a normal, benign package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks.",
