  "purpose": "Setup script for the mypy-boto3-cleanrooms package, used to install and configure the package environment.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; imports setup from setuptools; reads Python version for conditional dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network calls, file writes, or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "Reads local files to set package metadata; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward and typical of setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup routines: reading a local README for description, configuring package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. There are no signs of malicious code such as network activity, code injection, or backdoors. All operations involve reading local files or defining static configuration data. The use of 'Path' to read the README.md is safe. The dependencies are version-conditional, based on Python version, and do not introduce security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup configuration script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It reads local files and defines package metadata securely. No suspicious activities are present.",
