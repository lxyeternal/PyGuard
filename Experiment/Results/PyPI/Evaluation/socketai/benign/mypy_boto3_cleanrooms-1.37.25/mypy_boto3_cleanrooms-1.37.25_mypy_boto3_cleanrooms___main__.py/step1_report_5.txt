  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint script that provides package information and version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv; outputs data to stdout using sys.stdout.write.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to stdout; no other sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check in main() -> calls print_version() or print_info() -> writes static info to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward CLI utility that displays static package information and version details. It only reads command-line arguments and outputs predefined strings to stdout. There are no external data sources, no user input processing beyond argument presence, and no interaction with external systems or data flows that could be malicious. The code is simple, well-structured, and contains no suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI utility that solely outputs static package information and version data. It poses no security threat or malicious behavior.",
