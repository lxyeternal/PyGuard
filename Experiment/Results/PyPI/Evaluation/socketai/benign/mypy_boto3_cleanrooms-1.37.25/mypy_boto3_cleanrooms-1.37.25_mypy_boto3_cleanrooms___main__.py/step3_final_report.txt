  "purpose": "A minimal CLI utility that outputs static package info or version based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Reads sys.argv for '--version' argument.",
  "sinks": "Outputs static strings to sys.stdout.",
  "flows": "Checks for '--version' in argv, then writes static info or version to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and contains no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI script that outputs predefined package information or version number. It only reads command-line arguments and writes static data to stdout. There are no external data sources, network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. All behavior is static and benign. The code does not process untrusted input into sensitive operations, nor does it contain any hidden or malicious patterns. The logic is clear, and the functions are straightforward. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static CLI utility with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The provided reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, which are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
