{
  "purpose": "The script serves as a CLI entry point to display package information and version details for a specific Python package related to boto3 stubs.",
  "sources": "The code reads command-line arguments (sys.argv) and outputs data to stdout.",
  "fires": "Potentially untrusted command-line input (sys.argv) could influence flow, but the only check is for '--version'. Output functions write static or predefined information; no untrusted data is processed into critical functions.",
  "flows": "Input (sys.argv) -> Conditional check -> Output to stdout. No untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks beyond controlled outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. The code uses only standard library functions with static data. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The script reads command-line arguments to determine whether to print version information or package info. It outputs static, predefined strings. No user input is processed into unsafe functions, nor is there code that could execute arbitrary commands or leak data. The logic is straightforward and does not involve any malicious patterns or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package information based on command-line input. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is safe and serves its intended purpose without security concerns.",
