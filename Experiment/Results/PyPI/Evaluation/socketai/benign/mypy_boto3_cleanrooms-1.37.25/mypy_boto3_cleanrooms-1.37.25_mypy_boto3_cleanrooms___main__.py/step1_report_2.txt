  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious imports.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to print package info and version details, invoked based on command-line argument. No external data sources, network activity, or unsafe code constructs are present. No signs of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears to be a straightforward CLI utility.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI script that outputs package information and version number. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
