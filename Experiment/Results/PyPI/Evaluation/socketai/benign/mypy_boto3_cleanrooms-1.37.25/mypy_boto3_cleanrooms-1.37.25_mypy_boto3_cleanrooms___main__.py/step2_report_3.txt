  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The script is a CLI utility that outputs static package info or version info based on command-line argument `--version`.\n- It uses only standard library functions (`sys.argv`, `sys.stdout.write`).\n- No dynamic code execution, no external data sources, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- The logic is straightforward and static.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  No, the code appears benign. It does not process untrusted input beyond a simple string comparison, nor does it perform any suspicious operations.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, mistakes?**  \n  None detected. The code is simple, well-structured, and safe.\n\n- **Scores assigned in reports:**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical review of each report:\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** All reports correctly identify the script as a straightforward CLI utility that outputs static info. No malicious or obfuscated code is present.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are reported or detected.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, and security risk as 0, which is appropriate.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- **Malware:** 0, because there's no malicious behavior, no code injection, no network activity, no hidden backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** 0, the script is safe and does not process untrusted data beyond a simple argument check.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, and no changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThis is a benign, straightforward CLI utility with no security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated code, and overall security risk.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores at **0**.\n- No further action needed.\n\n**Note:** Always monitor for future updates or modifications, but based on the current code and reports, the supply chain security risk is minimal.",
