  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static package info or version details.\n   - It only reads `sys.argv` to determine if `--version` is present.\n   - It writes predefined strings to `stdout`.\n   - No external data, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code.\n   - No suspicious imports or behaviors.\n\n2. **Assessment of Report Validity:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious patterns.\n   - They correctly identify that the script's purpose is informational.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious behaviors, or potential vulnerabilities are detected.\n   - The reasoning is consistent, and the conclusion that the code is safe is justified.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0.0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0.0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - No issues found with the reasoning or scoring.\n   - The code is very simple and safe; no need to adjust scores.\n   - The high confidence (1.0) across all reports is justified.\n\n5. **Overall Justification:**\n   - The code does not contain any malicious or suspicious elements.\n   - The reports' conclusions and scores are aligned with the code's actual behavior.\n   - No assumptions are made beyond what the code demonstrates.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 (no security risk)\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a benign CLI utility for displaying static package info and version, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risk. The provided reports correctly identify this, and the scores are appropriate.",
