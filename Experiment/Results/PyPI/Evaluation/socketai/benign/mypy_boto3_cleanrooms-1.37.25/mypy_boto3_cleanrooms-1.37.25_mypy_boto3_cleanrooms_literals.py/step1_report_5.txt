  "purpose": "Define Python type literals for AWS CleanRooms service and related constants for type checking and validation.",
  "sources": "Imports sys and typing.Literal or typing_extensions.Literal based on Python version; all literals are hardcoded string constants.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or external data sources; no sensitive data handling or output sinks observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code solely declares constant literal types for static type checking.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code is a standard type annotation module.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily conditionally imports Literal from the standard typing module or typing_extensions based on Python version, which is common for compatibility. It then defines a comprehensive set of string Literal types representing various AWS resource names, actions, and statuses for static type annotations. No dynamic code execution, input handling, network operations, or sensitive data processing is present. All constants are static string literals used solely for type safety. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This module serves as a type definition file with static string literals for type safety in AWS SDK typings. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It is a safe, standard component for static analysis and type checking.",
