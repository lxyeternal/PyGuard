{
  "purpose": "Defines static type literals for AWS SDK service, resource, and configuration names to facilitate type checking and autocompletion in Python code.",
  "sources": "Static string literals and conditional import for 'Literal' based on Python version; no external data or runtime input.",
  "sinks": "None; purely static definitions with no data flow or external interactions.",
  "flows": "None; the module contains only type alias declarations without executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no obfuscated code, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple 'Literal' type aliases for AWS services, resource names, and configuration options, with a compatibility check for Python versions. It is a standard pattern for type stub modules, with no dynamic code, external data, or runtime logic. The extensive list of literals serves as constants for static analysis and IDE support. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static set of type definitions intended for type safety and documentation purposes. It poses no security risks, contains no malicious intent, and follows standard practices for type stub modules.",
