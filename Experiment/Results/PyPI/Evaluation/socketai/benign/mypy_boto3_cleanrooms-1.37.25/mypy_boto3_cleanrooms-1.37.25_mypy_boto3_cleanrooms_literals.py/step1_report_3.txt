  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various identifiers and categories used in the cleanrooms service for type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "The code imports sys for Python version checking and defines numerous Literal type aliases for constants, with no external input or data reading operations.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data flows or could cause data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code solely defines type aliases without runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present. The code is straightforward and consists of type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version, then defines multiple Literal type aliases for various string constants used in the package. It also declares an extensive list of string literals for various AWS resource identifiers, paginator names, and other categories. All of these are static definitions intended for type checking and documentation, with no dynamic or executable logic that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely declarative, defining type aliases for static strings to enhance code clarity and type safety. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured set of type definitions for a Python package.",
