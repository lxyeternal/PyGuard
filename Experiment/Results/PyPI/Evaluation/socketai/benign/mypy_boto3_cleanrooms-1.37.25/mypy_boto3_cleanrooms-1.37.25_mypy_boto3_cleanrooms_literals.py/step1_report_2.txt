  "purpose": "Define Python type literals for the AWS cleanrooms service and related enumerations to ensure type safety and code clarity in the boto3 stubs.",
  "sources": "Imports sys and conditional import of Literal; definitions of Literal types; module metadata (__all__).",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code only defines types and does not process untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a standard pattern for conditional import based on Python version, which is typical. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic are present. The extensive list of literals appears to be comprehensive and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of type annotations using Literal for various AWS service string enums. The conditional import of Literal based on Python version is a common compatibility pattern. No dynamic code execution, data processing, network operations, or other potentially malicious behaviors are present. The code serves as a static definitions module for type hinting.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign type definitions module for AWS boto3 service literals. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are evident. It is purely declarative and intended for type safety and code assistance.",
