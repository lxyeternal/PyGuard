  "purpose": "Define type literals for AWS CleanRooms service and related enumerations for static type checking.",
  "sources": "Type annotation definitions, import statements, sys.version_info check for conditional import.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, output, or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "N/A - the code only declares constants and types without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior. Usage of conditional import for compatibility is standard. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code provides static type definitions using Literal for AWS service and resource names, and for various configuration options. It includes conditional imports based on Python version to ensure compatibility. No runtime data handling, external connections, or potential data leaks are present. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or backdoors. The structure is typical for type stubs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of type annotations for AWS service enumerations, with no malicious intent or security issues. It is purely declarative, used for static analysis. No malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
