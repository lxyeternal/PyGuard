  "purpose": "Define type literals for various AWS SDK service and resource names used in the boto3_stubs for the cleanrooms service to enable type safety and autocompletion.",
  "sources": "Static import of type literals and conditional import of 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions'. No external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sinks; all are static type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is purely type annotation definitions. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'sys' to check Python version and conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions'. It then defines multiple string literal types for various AWS services and resource names, facilitating type safety in code that uses this module. The file contains no dynamic code execution, no input handling, and no runtime logic. All data are static string literals, serving as constants for type annotations. No obfuscated code, malicious patterns, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of type definitions for AWS service names and related identifiers. It is purely declarative with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It aids in type checking and code completion, with no malicious or insecure components.",
