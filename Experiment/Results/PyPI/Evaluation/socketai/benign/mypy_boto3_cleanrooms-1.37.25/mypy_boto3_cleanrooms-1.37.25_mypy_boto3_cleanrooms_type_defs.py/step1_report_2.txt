  "purpose": "Type definitions and annotations for the AWS CleanRooms SDK, facilitating type-safe API interactions.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, datetime, typing, and local literals module; various type and class definitions with annotations and unions.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data flows are present; no network, file, or environment variable operations detected.",
  "flows": "Pure type declaration flow; no data processing or execution logic, only data structure definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors observed. No suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code exclusively defines Python TypedDicts, type aliases, and imports necessary modules for static typing. No runtime code, data processing, or external interactions exist. The code follows standard patterns for type safety and documentation. No anomalies or signs of malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as type definitions for SDKs and does not contain malicious behaviors or security risks. It is purely structural, ensuring type safety and documentation clarity. No malicious activity or sabotage detected.",
