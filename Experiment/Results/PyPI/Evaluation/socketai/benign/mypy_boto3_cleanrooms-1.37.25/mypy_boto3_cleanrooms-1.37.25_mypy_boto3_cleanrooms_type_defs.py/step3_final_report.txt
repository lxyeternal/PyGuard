{
  "purpose": "The code defines static type annotations, data schemas, and import compatibility handling for a Python SDK, serving as type stub modules without executable logic.",
  "sources": "Import statements, type alias definitions, TypedDict data structures, conditional imports based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "None; no runtime data processing, external calls, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "Purely static data definitions; no data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; standard static type definitions with no embedded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type annotations, data schemas, and compatibility imports. It contains no executable code, network calls, or dynamic behavior. Conditional imports for Python version compatibility are standard and do not introduce obfuscation or malicious intent. The structure is clear, well-organized, and adheres to best practices for type stub files.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign, well-structured static type definition file for an SDK. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements. The scores are appropriately zero across malware, obfuscation, and security risk categories.",
