{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations and data structures for the cleanrooms service SDK, facilitating type safety and clarity in API interactions.",
  "sources": "Import statements; type definitions; data structure declarations and annotations throughout the code.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not perform data processing, output, or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "Type annotations and definitions establish data flow schemas; no runtime data flow or untrusted data processing present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. Usage of conditional imports based on sys.version_info is standard practice. No obfuscated or misleading code detected. No code injection, data leakage, or unsafe practices observed.",
  "analysis": "The code exclusively consists of type definitions, interface schemas, and import statements, aimed at providing static typing support. No executable logic, network operations, or dynamic code execution exists. The conditional imports adapt to Python versions, which is standard and safe. The absence of runtime code, external calls, or embedded secrets indicates no malicious behavior. The structure and content are consistent with library type definition files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured type definition module for the SDK, containing no malicious behavior or security risks. It simply declares data schemas and types for use within the SDK's implementation.",
