  "purpose": "Define Python type annotations and data structures for the cleanrooms service SDK.",
  "sources": "Imports of sys, datetime, typing, and internal literals; class and type definitions; no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; all code consists of type definitions and data structure declarations.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; solely static type annotations and data class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code patterns present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, conditional imports for compatibility, and a large set of TypedDict class definitions for data models used in a SDK. There are no functions, runtime logic, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The code appears to serve as a type definition module for SDK data structures. No signs of code injection, malicious behavior, or sabotage are present. Usage of standard Python typing features and structured data models indicates a purely static codebase designed for type safety and data validation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a non-malicious, well-structured type definitions module for a Python SDK. It contains no indicators of malware, sabotage, or security risks. It solely defines data structures and type annotations, with no runtime or external data handling that could be exploited.",
