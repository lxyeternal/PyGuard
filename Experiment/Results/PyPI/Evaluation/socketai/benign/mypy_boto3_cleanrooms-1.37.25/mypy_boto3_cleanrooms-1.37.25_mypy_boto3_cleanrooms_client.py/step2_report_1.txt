  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check for logical consistency, and then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Summary:** The report states that the code is an auto-generated or structured SDK interface for AWS CleanRooms, with no malicious features, backdoors, or obfuscation. It notes no suspicious behaviors, no hardcoded secrets, and that the code strictly follows documented API patterns.  \n- **Assessment:** This aligns with the code's structure: it's a class with method signatures, type annotations, and documentation links. No dynamic code, no data leaks, and no evidence of malicious activity.  \n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, which is reasonable.  \n- **Conclusion:** The code is safe, SDK interface code with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is a type annotation and interface definition with no data processing or network calls, no anomalies, and no malicious behaviors.  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code's nature. It is purely an interface/stub with no executable logic beyond method signatures.  \n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, which is appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** No security threat; it's a safe, well-structured SDK stub.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Summary:** Again, confirms the code is a type-annotated client interface for AWS SDK, following standard patterns, with no malicious logic or obfuscation. It notes the code is mainly boilerplate, with documentation links, and no signs of sabotage.  \n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent with the code content.  \n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, justified given the nature of the code.  \n- **Conclusion:** No security issues; standard SDK interface.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Summary:** The report describes the code as a type-annotated client class for AWS, with method signatures, resource management, and data retrieval functions. It notes that while methods interact with AWS SDK, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The only concern might be the extensive parameter unpacking, which is typical for SDK wrappers.  \n- **Assessment:** The code does indeed mainly define method signatures, type annotations, and documentation. No dynamic or insecure code is present.  \n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, which is consistent. The securityRisk is 0.1, perhaps reflecting minimal concern over resource identifiers or API interactions, but this is a very low risk.  \n- **Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, safe SDK interface with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis**\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that this is a structured, auto-generated SDK interface for AWS CleanRooms, with no actual logic beyond method signatures, type annotations, and documentation links.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports agree on the absence of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or backdoors.\n- **Security risk:** Given the nature of the code—just method signatures and type annotations—there is no real security risk. The minimal risk score (0.1) in Report 5 accounts for the potential resource identifiers, but this is negligible.\n- **Confidence:** High across all reports, with the last report slightly less than 1, possibly due to cautious interpretation of resource handling.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Evaluation & Recommendations**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no signs of malicious code, payloads, or obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear, structured, and auto-generated SDK interface.\n- **Risk Score:** **0** — no security threat identified; this is a standard SDK stub with no dynamic or insecure code.\n\n**Note:** The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify this as a safe, boilerplate SDK interface code, with no malicious or obfuscated features.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n**The code is a legitimate, auto-generated, type-safe SDK interface for AWS CleanRooms. It poses no security threat, malware risk, or obfuscation concerns.**",
