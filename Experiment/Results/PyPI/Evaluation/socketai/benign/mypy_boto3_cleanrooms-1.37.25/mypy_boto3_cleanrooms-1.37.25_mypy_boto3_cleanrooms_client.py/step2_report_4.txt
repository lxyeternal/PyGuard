  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's structure, purpose, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The report states that the code is an auto-generated, structured SDK interface with no malicious behaviors, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** The code is a comprehensive, well-documented, type-annotated client wrapper for AWS SDK (boto3) for the CleanRooms service. It consists of method signatures, overloads for paginators, exception classes, and documentation links. No dynamic code, no data processing beyond API call signatures, and no suspicious logic are present.\n- **Malware / Risk:** **0** — purely interface/stub code, no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n\n**Conclusion:** Fully benign, standard SDK interface code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is a type annotation and interface definition with no actual data handling or malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** Same as above. The code is a structured SDK stub, not executing any logic beyond method signatures and documentation.\n- **Malware / Risk:** **0** — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0**\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n\n**Conclusion:** No security concern; standard SDK interface.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is a type-annotated client interface with no data processing or suspicious features.\n- **Assessment:** The code contains no dynamic execution, no data leaks, no obfuscated code. It is purely a set of method signatures and type hints for API calls.\n- **Malware / Risk:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated:** **0**\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Conclusion:** Safe, boilerplate SDK stub.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the fact that the code is a type-safe wrapper around AWS SDK, with no malicious behaviors or backdoors.\n- **Assessment:** The code only defines method signatures, uses standard import patterns, and references documentation. No suspicious logic, no dynamic code, no data leaks.\n- **Malware / Risk:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated:** **0**\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Conclusion:** Legitimate SDK interface, no security threat.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Notes that the code handles resource identifiers and API interactions, with no obfuscation or backdoors. Slightly elevated security risk due to resource handling.\n- **Assessment:** While the code interacts with AWS resources via method calls, it remains a standard SDK wrapper. The mention of resource identifiers (like ARNs) is typical. The risk is minimal; no hardcoded secrets or malicious logic.\n- **Malware / Risk:** **0.0** (malware), but a **securityRisk** of **0.1** due to resource handling, which is acceptable for SDK wrappers.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0**\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, type-safe SDK client interface. The slight security concern is inherent to resource management but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on **0**. The code is a structured, auto-generated SDK interface with no malicious logic.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports report **0** obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code, a **risk score > 0.5** is unwarranted. The minimal risk stems from resource handling, which is standard in SDK wrappers.\n\n### **Final Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated:** **0**\n- **Risk:** **0.1** (due to resource identifiers and API exposure, but not malicious)\n\nThis code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured, auto-generated SDK interface for AWS CleanRooms, with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain sabotage.",
