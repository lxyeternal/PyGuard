{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class for interacting with AWS CleanRooms service via boto3, providing methods for resource management and data retrieval.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own class definitions, method signatures, and imported modules. It unpacks input parameters for API calls and retrieves configurations or resource identifiers.",
  "sinks": "Method calls to AWS SDK (boto3), especially generate_presigned_url, tag_resource, untag_resource, and various get/modify operations that handle resource identifiers, credentials, or sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Inputs from method parameters (often resource identifiers, ARNs, or configurations) flow into boto3 client methods which execute AWS API calls, potentially exposing or modifying resources.",
  "anomalies": "The code is largely standard SDK client setup with type annotations; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious dynamic code execution are present. The only noteworthy aspect is the extensive use of parameter unpacking with type definitions, which is typical in SDK wrappers.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured, well-annotated class for AWS SDK interaction, providing a type-safe interface for AWS CleanRooms. It imports necessary modules, defines a client class with numerous API methods, overloads for paginators, and an exception class. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. It appears to be a legitimate, SDK-based interface implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured AWS SDK client wrapper with comprehensive type annotations. There are no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks beyond typical SDK use. It is safe and appears to serve its purpose as a type-safe interface to AWS CleanRooms.",
