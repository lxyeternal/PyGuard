{
  "purpose": "This code defines a type-safe, auto-generated client interface for AWS's CleanRooms service, primarily consisting of method signatures, type annotations, and documentation links. It serves as a structured SDK wrapper with no executable logic or malicious features.",
  "sources": "Method signatures, type annotations, import statements, and documentation links within the class and associated type definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code does not process or handle data at runtime, only defines interfaces.",
  "flows": "Method calls and type annotations facilitate API interactions with AWS services but do not execute any logic within this code segment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a standard SDK interface with no dynamic code, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive, well-structured SDK client class with method signatures for AWS CleanRooms operations, including overloads for paginators. It imports standard modules and defines exception classes, all following AWS SDK patterns. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or dynamic code execution. The minimal risk score (around 0.1) in some reports is justified by the resource identifiers and API call patterns inherent to SDK wrappers, which could be misused if misconfigured but are not malicious in themselves.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, auto-generated SDK interface for AWS CleanRooms, with no malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation. It poses no security threat and is consistent with standard SDK patterns.",
