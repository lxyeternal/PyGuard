  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface definition for the AWS CleanRooms service, providing method signatures for API operations.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class and method definitions, property and overload decorators, and inline documentation.",
  "sinks": "No actual data sinks, network calls, or data processing logic present; only method signatures and type annotations.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data handling occurs within this code snippet; it's purely an interface definition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior observed. The code mainly defines client methods, types, and documentation links.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of import statements, class definitions, property and method signatures with type annotations, overloads for pagination, and comprehensive docstrings linking to external documentation. It does not perform any data processing, network requests, or system modifications. No suspicious logic, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are detected within this interface definition. The presence of documentation links and type definitions indicates a focus on type safety and clarity, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured Python interface for AWS SDK (boto3) service client with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It only provides method signatures, types, and documentation, serving as a type-safe stub for the AWS CleanRooms API.",
