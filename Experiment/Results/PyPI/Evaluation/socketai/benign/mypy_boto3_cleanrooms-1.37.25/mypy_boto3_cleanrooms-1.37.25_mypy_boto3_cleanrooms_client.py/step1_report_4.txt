{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface for the AWS CleanRooms service SDK, facilitating type-safe interactions with AWS APIs.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and internal modules; method definitions for AWS API calls; overloads for paginator creation.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions handle untrusted data directly; parameters are for API calls with predefined types, and return types are mostly structured data or strings.",
  "flows": "Method parameters unpacking typed dictionaries, no external untrusted input directly handled; method calls are straightforward API invocations with no suspicious data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns; the code is mainly boilerplate type annotations, method signatures, and API client setup. The 'Copyright 2025 Vlad Emelianov' appears somewhat futuristic but not suspicious in itself.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive type-annotated client interface for AWS SDK's CleanRooms service, including methods for all API operations and paginator overloads. It follows standard patterns for AWS SDKs, with no evidence of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks. The use of imports, type hints, and method definitions aligns with standard SDK development. No external data is processed insecurely, nor are there any indications of data leakage or malicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a well-structured, type-annotated client interface for AWS SDK, with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security issues. It appears to be a legitimate, boilerplate SDK wrapper focused on type safety and API method definitions.",
