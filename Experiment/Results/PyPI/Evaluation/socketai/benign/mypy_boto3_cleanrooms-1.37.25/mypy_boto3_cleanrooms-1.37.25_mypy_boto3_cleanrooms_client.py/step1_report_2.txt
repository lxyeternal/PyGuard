{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definitions for the AWS CleanRooms service, providing a structured interface for API calls with type hints.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class and method definitions, property and overload decorators, constant strings, docstrings, and type annotations.",
  "sinks": "Method calls to AWS SDK (boto3/botocore), potential data flows from input parameters to API requests, and exception handling.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (kwargs) are unpacked and used in API calls; method calls correspond to AWS service operations, with no evident direct untrusted data flows outside standard SDK usage.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors; the code appears to be auto-generated or structured SDK interface code. No hidden or obfuscated code features are present. All methods strictly follow documented API patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a typed wrapper around the AWS SDK for the CleanRooms service, with class definitions, type annotations, and method signatures aligned with AWS API documentation. It uses overloads for paginators, defines exception classes, and includes detailed docstrings referencing official documentation. There is no dynamic code execution, code injection, or data exfiltration logic. All imports and code structures are consistent with SDK interface definitions, not malicious or sabotage code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a structured, well-documented SDK interface for AWS CleanRooms, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It is likely auto-generated or maintained for type safety and clarity. Overall, it poses no security threat.",
