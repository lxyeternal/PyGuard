{
  "purpose": "This code defines and exports classes and constants for interfacing with the AWS 'cleanrooms' service, primarily for managing and paginating through various resources.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (client and paginator modules); no external or user input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or execute untrusted code are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from imported classes and functions to exported identifiers, with no processing or data manipulation involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a straightforward module setup for AWS SDK usage, with no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No obfuscated or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports internal classes and paginator classes related to AWS 'cleanrooms' service, assigns the main client class to a variable, and defines an __all__ list for module exports. There are no dynamic code executions, user inputs, or data handling mechanisms. It functions solely as a module for defining and exporting classes and constants for API interactions. The structure is typical for SDK wrapper modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard SDK wrapper module for AWS 'cleanrooms', with no malicious intent, no suspicious code, and no security risks detected. It simply exposes classes and constants for external use.",
