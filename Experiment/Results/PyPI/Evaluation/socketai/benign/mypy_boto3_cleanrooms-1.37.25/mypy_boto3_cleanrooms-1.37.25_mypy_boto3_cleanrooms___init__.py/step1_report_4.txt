{
  "purpose": "This code defines imports and initializations for the AWS boto3 SDK related to the 'cleanrooms' service, including paginator classes and client setup.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.client, .paginator), and the explicit creation of the Client alias.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling, network communication, or sensitive data processing observed.",
  "flows": "Import statements lead to the setup of class references; no runtime data flow involving untrusted input or external data sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as obfuscated code, hidden logic, or hardcoded secrets. The code is straightforward and consistent with standard SDK setup.",
  "analysis": "The code solely imports classes from local modules and assigns a class to a variable. It includes a detailed docstring with usage examples but no dynamic or untrusted data handling. No indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious code injection are present. All operations are static and pertain to SDK setup. There are no hidden or obfuscated sections, no suspicious network or system calls, and no credential handling or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard SDK setup and import script for AWS boto3 cleanrooms service. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
