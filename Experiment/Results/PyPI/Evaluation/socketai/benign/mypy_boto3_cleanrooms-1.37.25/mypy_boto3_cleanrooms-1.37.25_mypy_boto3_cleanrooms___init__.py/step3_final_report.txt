  "purpose": "This code defines a Python module that imports and re-exports classes related to the AWS 'cleanrooms' service, serving as an SDK interface for resource management and pagination.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from internal modules (.client and .paginator), no untrusted input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, network activity, or data leaks; purely static setup.",
  "flows": "Importing classes from internal modules and assigning an alias; no data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code; the 'Copyright 2025' date is unusual but benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SDK interface module with static imports and exports, containing no dynamic execution, no untrusted data processing, and no network activity. It is well-structured, with clear purpose, and lacks any signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The documentation and licensing comments are standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK interface module for AWS 'cleanrooms' with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals and scores are consistent with this assessment.",
