{
  "purpose": "This code provides a main interface for the 'cleanrooms' service, including imports and exports of clients and paginator classes for interacting with the AWS CleanRooms service.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator), and the inclusion of documentation and licensing comments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code mainly defines imports, class aliases, and an __all__ export list. No data processing, input handling, or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the code establishes class and module structure without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are present. The licensing comments are standard, and the import statements are typical for module setup.",
  "analysis": "The code only defines imports from local modules and establishes an API interface for the AWS 'cleanrooms' service. The presence of detailed docstrings and licensing comments is standard. There are no obfuscated language features, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns. No hardcoded credentials or data leaks are evident. The structure is typical for a Python SDK interface module.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, benign SDK interface module for AWS CleanRooms service. It does not contain any malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks based on the provided content.",
