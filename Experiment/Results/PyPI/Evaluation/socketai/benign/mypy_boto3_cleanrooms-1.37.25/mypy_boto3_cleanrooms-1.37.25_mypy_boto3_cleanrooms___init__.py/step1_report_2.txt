{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an interface for the AWS 'cleanrooms' service, importing client and paginator classes for interacting with the service's API.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator), and the string assignment for __all__.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks involving untrusted data or sensitive information processing are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow paths involving untrusted input to sensitive operations; the code primarily defines imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, such as hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or backdoors, are evident. The code appears to be a straightforward module setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python module that imports classes related to the AWS 'boto3' service for 'cleanrooms'. It defines imports from internal modules (.client and .paginator) and sets up an alias 'Client'. The __all__ list specifies exported symbols. There is no user input handling, no network activity, no credential management, nor obfuscated code or dynamic execution. The code's structure is typical for SDK interface modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign SDK interface module with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It functions as a structured import/export definition for AWS 'cleanrooms' service components.",
