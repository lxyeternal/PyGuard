{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an interface module for the 'cleanrooms' service, providing imports, class aliasing, and exporting relevant paginator classes and the client.",
  "sources": "The code sources include import statements from local modules (.client and .paginator), and assignments such as 'Client = CleanRoomsServiceClient'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed, evaluated, or sent over the network. The code only performs static imports, variable assignments, and exports.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted inputs; the code only sets up class references and module exports.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs. The 'Copyright 2025' date is unconventional but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports classes from internal modules and re-exports them, establishing a clear API surface for the 'cleanrooms' service. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation. No external input or untrusted data is processed. The static structure indicates standard SDK-like code for Python package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, well-structured module providing API access to AWS cleanrooms service components. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected.",
