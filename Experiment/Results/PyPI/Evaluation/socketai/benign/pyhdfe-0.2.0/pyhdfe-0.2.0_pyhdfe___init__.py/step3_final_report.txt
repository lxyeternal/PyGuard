  "purpose": "Initialize the package by exposing internal modules and version information.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: .algorithms, .interface, .version",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external communication present",
  "flows": "Imports are static; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward module setup with no suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard __init__.py file that imports specific objects and defines __all__ for public API exposure. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code. Confidence is high (1), as the code is straightforward and well-understood. No anomalies or risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package initialization script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is justified. No further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
