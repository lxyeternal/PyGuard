{
  "purpose": "This code defines public API exports for a Python package, exposing Algorithm, create, and __version__ for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: .algorithms, .interface, .version",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only sets exports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific objects from internal modules and exposes them via __all__, indicating intended API structure. It does not process or handle any untrusted input, nor does it execute dynamic code or include suspicious behavior. The module appears to be a straightforward API surface definition with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module export configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and typical for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
