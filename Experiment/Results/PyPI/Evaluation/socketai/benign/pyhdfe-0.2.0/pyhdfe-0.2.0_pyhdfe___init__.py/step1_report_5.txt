{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be defining module exports and importing specific components for use in other parts of a package.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.algorithms, .interface, .version) and the __version__ attribute.",
  "sinks": "No sinks related to untrusted data or external effects; only module attribute definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code mainly sets up exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; the code is straightforward module setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports components from internal modules, including Algorithm, create, and __version__, and defines __all__ for exports. There are no dynamic executions, data manipulations, or external communications. The structure is typical for Python packages. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard module setup code with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply manages exports and imports, with no apparent malicious intent or security concerns.",
