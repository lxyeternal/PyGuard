{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an __init__.py module to expose specific objects (Algorithm, create, __version__) for package use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.algorithms, .interface, .version) and the assignment of __all__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only imports and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific components from local modules and defines __all__ for public API exposure. It is a typical package initialization file without any dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious patterns. The structure is straightforward and adheres to common Python package conventions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a simple module initializer with no malicious intent or security issues.",
