  "purpose": "Algorithms for fixed effect absorption, including dummy, within, SW, fixed point, MAP, and LSMR methods, used for residualizing matrices in statistical modeling.",
  "sources": "Reads fixed effect IDs, cluster IDs, weights, and matrices; internal matrix operations and dummy variable constructions.",
  "sinks": "Returns residualized matrices; no external network or file I/O observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input matrices and IDs through residualization procedures, involving matrix multiplications, inversions, and iterative transformations.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, suspicious external activity, or backdoors detected; code relies on standard scientific libraries and routines.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard numpy/scipy routines for linear algebra, sparse matrix operations, and iterative algorithms typical in econometrics/statistics. No external data leaks, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. The complex numerical methods are legitimate and well-documented. No suspicious code structures or obfuscation are observed. The detailed reasoning confirms the absence of malicious intent, sabotage, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of fixed effect residualization algorithms, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The high confidence scores are justified by the straightforward, standard mathematical operations involved.",
