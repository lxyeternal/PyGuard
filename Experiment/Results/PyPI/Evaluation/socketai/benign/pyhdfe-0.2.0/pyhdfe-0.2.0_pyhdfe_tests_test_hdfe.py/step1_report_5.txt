{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of tests for a statistical algorithm related to residualization, degrees of freedom, and clustering, primarily aimed at validating correct implementation and behavior of the create function and associated methods.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the imported modules, pytest fixtures, and parameters. Specifically, input data such as 'problem', 'drop_singletons', 'residualize_method', and 'options' are used to generate or modify data for testing.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present. The code does not write or send data externally, nor does it execute external commands or handle sensitive data in a suspicious manner.",
  "flows": "Input data from parameters and fixtures flows into the create function, residualize method, and into mathematical computations. There are no external network or system calls involved; data flows remain within the testing scope.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard testing code with parametric tests. No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code are detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or misleading variables are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs structured unit tests using pytest, parametrize, and mathematical assertions. It verifies the correctness of algorithm outputs, limits, degrees of freedom, and cluster effects. No external data sources, network operations, or malicious logic are present. The code utilizes numpy and scipy for linear algebra calculations in a straightforward manner, with no signs of obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test suite for a statistical or data processing library. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, or external communications. The overall security risk is very low, and there are no indicators of malware or sabotage.",
