  "purpose": "A set of pytest-based unit tests for a statistical/data processing library, verifying residualization, degrees of freedom, clustering, and regression correctness.",
  "sources": "Fixtures providing data inputs, internal variables within test functions, and library functions such as create and scipy.linalg.",
  "sinks": "Internal computations and assertions; no external data transmission or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from fixtures into test functions, through residualization and linear algebra operations, ending with assertions to verify correctness.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Exception handling is standard for test skipping.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test suite utilizing standard scientific libraries and practices. It performs mathematical assertions to verify algorithm correctness, with no external network or file I/O. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads are present. Exception handling is used to skip unsupported features, typical in testing environments. The code's intent is clear and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured test suite with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The minimal security risk scores (around 0.1) assigned in some reports are reasonable conservative estimates, reflecting the cautious nature of security assessments but do not indicate actual threats.",
