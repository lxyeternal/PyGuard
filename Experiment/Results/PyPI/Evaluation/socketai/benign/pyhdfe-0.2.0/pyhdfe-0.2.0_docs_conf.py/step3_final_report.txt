{
  "purpose": "The code configures and manages Sphinx documentation, processes notebooks for link replacements and execution count resets, and handles static files and environment variables for build setup.",
  "sources": "Reads notebook JSON files, static configuration files, environment variables, and source code strings.",
  "sinks": "Writes modified notebook JSON files, static configuration files, and signature strings; no external network or data leaks involved.",
  "flows": "Reads notebook files and static configs -> modifies notebook cells and signatures -> writes back to local files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation detected; operations are standard for documentation workflows.",
  "analysis": "The script performs benign file I/O, string replacements, and configuration tasks. It resets execution counts in notebooks, replaces domain links with documentation URLs, and strips type hints from signatures. No suspicious patterns, external communications, or malicious code are present. The code's activities are typical for documentation setup and processing, with no signs of sabotage or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard documentation configuration and processing script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The existing scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low risk (~0.1) are justified and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
