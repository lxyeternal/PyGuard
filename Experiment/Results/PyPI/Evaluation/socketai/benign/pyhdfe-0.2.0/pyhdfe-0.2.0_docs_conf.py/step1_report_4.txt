  "purpose": "Configuration and processing scripts for Sphinx documentation, including notebook processing and setup routines.",
  "sources": "Reading files (`Path.read_text()`), environment variables (`os.environ.get()`), and JSON content from notebooks.",
  "sinks": "Writing processed notebooks (`Path.write_text()`), reading static files (`read()`), and external link configuration.",
  "flows": "File reading for notebook processing and static files, environment variable to URL configuration, JSON parsing from notebooks, and writing processed notebooks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behavior. The code mainly performs file manipulations, regex replacements, and configuration setup.",
  "analysis": "The script is a configuration module for Sphinx documentation, processing notebooks, cleaning directories, and setting up resources. It reads and writes JSON files and static resources, modifies notebook content for link replacements, and configures build parameters. No dynamic code execution, external network activity, or suspicious data handling is evident. The environment variable usage is limited to URL generation, not security-sensitive data. All file operations appear legitimate and related to documentation generation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration script for documentation with notebook processing and setup routines. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified. The code performs benign file handling, regex replacements, and configuration setup without any signs of malware or malicious intent.",
