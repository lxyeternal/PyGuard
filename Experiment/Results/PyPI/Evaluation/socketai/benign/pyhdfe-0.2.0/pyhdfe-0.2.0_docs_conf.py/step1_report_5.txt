{
  "purpose": "The code configures a Sphinx documentation build environment, processes notebooks, manages static files, and customizes signatures in autodoc.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, file system (notebooks, static files), and JSON content from notebooks.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or transmits data to external systems; local file system operations are limited to copying and writing files.",
  "flows": "Reads environment variables -> Reads and modifies notebook JSON files -> Writes modified files back to disk -> Connects Sphinx events for signature processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or logic. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The code processes notebooks and modifies signatures, but all actions are related to documentation generation.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs configuration and file processing tasks for documentation. It reads environment variables for build URLs, reads and updates notebook files, and strips type hints from function signatures. No external network connections are made, and no code executes untrusted input or malicious commands. The only noteworthy behavior is the replacement of domain references in notebooks, which is benign and related to documentation formatting. There are no signs of malicious activity or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration script for documentation generation with safe file and environment handling. It does not contain malware or security risks. It appears to be well-structured for its purpose without malicious intent.",
