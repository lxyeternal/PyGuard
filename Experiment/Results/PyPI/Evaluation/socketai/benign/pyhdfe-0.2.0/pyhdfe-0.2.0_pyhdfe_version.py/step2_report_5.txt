  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - There are no input sources, data sinks, data flows, or external interactions.\n   - The code is minimal and follows standard practices for version declaration in Python packages.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues or Malicious Behavior**:\n   - No report identifies any suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code.\n   - The code snippet does not perform any network activity, dynamic code execution, or data handling.\n   - All reports agree that this is benign and typical.\n\n3. **Error, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes**:\n   - No errors or flaws are identified in any report.\n   - The logic is simple and correct for its purpose.\n\n4. **Scores and Their Justification**:\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n   - Confidence levels are high (1 or 1.0), which is reasonable given the simplicity.\n\n5. **Any Discrepancies or Unreasonable Scores?**:\n   - The scores seem appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n   - No suspicious claims or assumptions are made about vulnerabilities.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The code is a standard, non-malicious version declaration.\n   - The risk scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n   - No further investigation or concern is warranted based on this snippet.\n\n**Final conclusion**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary**:\nAll reports correctly identify this code as benign, with appropriate scoring. No changes are necessary.",
