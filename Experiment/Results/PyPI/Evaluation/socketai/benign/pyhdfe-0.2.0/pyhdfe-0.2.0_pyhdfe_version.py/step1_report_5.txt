  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no anomalies or suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a version string to a variable, which is standard practice in Python packages. There are no input sources, data processing, or external interactions. The code does not contain obfuscation, dynamic execution, or malicious constructs. The only notable aspect is that it declares a package version, which is common and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version declaration with no malicious behavior or security concerns.",
