  "purpose": "Declare the current package version as a static string.",
  "sources": "No external sources; the code assigns a version string to __version__.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "Single assignment from a string literal to __version__, no data flow beyond this.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward version declaration with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static assignment of a version string, typical in Python packages. It involves no input, output, external dependencies, or dynamic code execution. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0. The code shows no signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no security concerns or malicious behavior. All reports are accurate, and no modifications are necessary.",
