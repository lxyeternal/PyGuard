  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims made, then evaluate the scores assigned.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code snippet is a straightforward assignment: `__version__ = '0.2.0'`.\n   - No input/output, data processing, external data handling, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs.\n   - The code is typical for version declaration in Python packages.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports uniformly assert that this is a benign, standard practice with no security concerns.\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident in the reasoning; all reports are consistent and accurate regarding the simplicity of the code.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 or 1.0, which is reasonable given the simplicity.\n     - `obfuscated`: 0, appropriate since no obfuscation is present.\n     - `malware`: 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n     - `securityRisk`: 0, aligns with the lack of any security issue.\n   - These scores seem appropriate; no adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - All scores are 0, indicating no risk, malware, or obfuscation.\n   - This is justified because the code is a simple version string assignment with no malicious intent or security vulnerability.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The reports correctly assign `malware` as 0, since there's no malicious activity.\n   - No discrepancies here.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions and correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No unwarranted security implications are made.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and appropriate given the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThe code is a minimal, standard version declaration with no security risks, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### My personal estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current assessments and the nature of the code snippet.",
