{
  "purpose": "Sets up the package using setuptools, reading metadata and dependencies from local files.",
  "sources": "Reads version from 'pyhdfe/version.py', dependencies from 'requirements.txt', and description from 'README.rst'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; all data is read from local, controlled files.",
  "flows": "File reads lead to package configuration; no external data flow or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'assert' for version validation, which can be disabled, but does not impact security; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with straightforward file reads and no dynamic or network operations. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The regex parsing and 'assert' are typical, and the overall structure is benign. All signals point to a safe, well-structured package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0. No modifications are necessary.",
