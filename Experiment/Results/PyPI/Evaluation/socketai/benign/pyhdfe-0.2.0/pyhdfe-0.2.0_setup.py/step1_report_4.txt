{
  "purpose": "Set up and configure the Python package 'pyhdfe' for distribution, including reading version, dependencies, and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'pyhdfe/version.py', reads requirements from 'requirements.txt', reads long description from 'README.rst'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data are present; setup parameters are static or derived from local files.",
  "flows": "Data flows from local files ('version.py', 'requirements.txt', 'README.rst') into the setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors observed. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It reads metadata and dependencies from local files, performs a regex to extract version, and calls setup() with static and dynamically read data. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors. The operations are straightforward file reads and package configuration, typical for package distribution scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign, standard setup configuration for a Python package with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
