{
  "purpose": "This script sets up and configures the Python package 'pyhdfe' for distribution, specifying dependencies, metadata, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'pyhdfe/version.py', requirements from 'requirements.txt', and long description from 'README.rst'.",
  "sinks": "None of the code explicitly executes or writes untrusted data; it primarily reads static files and passes their contents to setup().",
  "flows": "Reads version and description data from files, then passes this data to setup() to configure package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval-like regex to parse version, but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup procedures: reading version info, dependencies, and descriptions from files, then configuring package metadata and requirements. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or handling of untrusted input are present. The file is straightforward and adheres to common packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python setup script with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It securely reads static data from files and prepares the package for distribution without executing or exposing sensitive data.",
