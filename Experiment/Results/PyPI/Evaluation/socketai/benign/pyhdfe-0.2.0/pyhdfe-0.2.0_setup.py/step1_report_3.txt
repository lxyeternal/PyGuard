{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package named 'pyhdfe' by reading metadata, dependencies, and configuration details from various files.",
  "sources": "Reads files: 'pyhdfe/version.py', 'requirements.txt', 'README.rst' from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no untrusted data is processed or outputted to external systems.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from 'version.py' and requirements from 'requirements.txt', then uses these in package setup; no untrusted data flows to insecure or malicious sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected. The code uses safe, standard setup procedures without obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a typical package setup using setuptools, reading static files for configuration. It securely reads version and description info, and specifies dependencies explicitly. No dynamic code execution, user input processing, or network activity is present. All file reads are from local, controlled files, and there are no signs of malicious behavior or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign setup script for a Python package with no indicators of malicious or suspicious activity. The code follows common practices without any malicious patterns.",
