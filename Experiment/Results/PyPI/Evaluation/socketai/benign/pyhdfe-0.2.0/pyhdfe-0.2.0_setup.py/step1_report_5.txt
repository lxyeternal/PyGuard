  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the pyhdfe Python package, including dependencies, metadata, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from 'pyhdfe/version.py', reads requirements from 'requirements.txt', reads long description from 'README.rst'.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no direct data sinks or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "Reads version info -> uses it for setup; reads dependencies and description files -> uses in package setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Use of lambda for reading files is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup procedures: reading files for version, requirements, and description; configuring package metadata. All file reads are from local filesystem paths and are used in the package configuration. No external inputs or untrusted data sources are processed dynamically. No code injections, network calls, or sensitive data handling are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It performs standard package setup tasks safely.",
