  "flows": "Source: annotation string or variable; Sink: eval_expr evaluation point.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval_expr on potentially untrusted annotation strings; no network or file system modifications; no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static analysis utility for processing type annotations, substitutions, and late annotations. It uses eval_expr to evaluate string annotations, which could be risky if annotations are maliciously crafted. However, in the context of static analysis, this evaluation is controlled and does not execute arbitrary code at runtime. No malicious code, network activity, or sabotage is present. The code is well-structured and transparent, with no obfuscation. The primary concern is the potential for malicious annotations to be evaluated, but this is a known and accepted risk in static analysis tools. The malware score is therefore 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk score approximately 0.2, reflecting the evaluation of untrusted strings.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for static type annotation processing with minimal security concern, primarily related to evaluating string annotations. No malicious activity or sabotage detected. The scores are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
