{
  "purpose": "This setup script configures the build and installation process for the pytype Python package, including compilation of C++ extensions and data file management.",
  "sources": "Reading configuration data, file system operations (os.path, glob, shutil), package data scanning, and reading README.md for long description.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data or external network communication is performed.",
  "flows": "The code reads local files and directory structures to gather package data, then uses this data in setup(), without passing untrusted input to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, no suspicious network activity, and no unusual code patterns. The only notable aspect is file operations and package configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup operations: importing modules, defining functions to generate build extensions, copying files, scanning directories for data files, and reading the README for description. It uses standard practices for package configuration and file management, with no indications of malicious behavior. No code injection, network communication, or data leaks are evident. The operations are typical for a build script. No anomalies or suspicious patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for building and installing a Python package with C++ extensions. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The logic is straightforward, with safe file operations and no suspicious code paths.",
