  "purpose": "Setup script for the pytype package, including configuration for extensions and data files.",
  "sources": "File system operations (os.path, os.remove, shutil.copytree, os.walk), reading README.md, importing setup tools, and custom functions for copying and scanning files.",
  "sinks": "File deletion/removal, copying directories/files, glob.glob matching, and reading files. No untrusted data sources or external inputs are directly used.",
  "flows": "No external untrusted input flows detected; data flows are limited to file system operations and static resource inclusion.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors. Functions perform standard build and setup tasks, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code is primarily configuration and file management.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup operations for a Python package, including copying a 'typeshed' directory if needed, scanning directories for data files, and preparing package data. It imports necessary modules and handles filesystem operations carefully. No signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, command execution, network communication, or code injection are present. The logic appears typical for a setup script, with functions for directory copying and data collection, and no suspicious patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for the pytype package, involving filesystem management and package configuration. There is no evidence of malicious intent or malware. The script appears safe, performing typical package build steps without any harmful actions.",
