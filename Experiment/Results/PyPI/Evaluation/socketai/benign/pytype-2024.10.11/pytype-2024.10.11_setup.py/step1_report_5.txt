  "purpose": "Setup script for building and configuring the pytype package, including compiling C++ extensions and copying typeshed data.",
  "sources": "File system operations (os.path, os.remove, os.rmdir, shutil functions), glob.glob for pattern matching, reading 'README.md', importing setup and extension helpers.",
  "sinks": "File operations (removing directories/files, copying directories), glob matching results used in package data configuration.",
  "flows": "Reading files -> determining package data -> copying directories -> setting up extensions and package data",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious file paths, or network activity. The code uses standard package setup procedures and file operations. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical setup tasks: configuring extension modules, copying static data directories, and gathering package data files. It manipulates the filesystem to ensure data is correctly placed, and reads documentation files. All operations are standard for package setup scripts. No code injection, network access, or malicious payloads are present. The use of os.remove and shutil.rmtree is for cleanup and copying, not malicious activity. The imported modules are standard or common setup helpers. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with C++ extensions. It performs filesystem operations, file pattern matching, and package configuration without any malicious intent. No malware or security risks are present based on the provided code.",
