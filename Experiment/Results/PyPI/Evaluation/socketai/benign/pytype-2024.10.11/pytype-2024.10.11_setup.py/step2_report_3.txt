  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports describe a setup script performing filesystem operations, copying directories, scanning for data files, and configuring package build options.\n- No report mentions dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling untrusted input.\n- The code appears standard for a Python package setup involving C++ extensions and data files.\n- The reports uniformly assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and very low or zero security risk, which aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Logical Checks:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** The code does not contain any suspicious or malicious patterns; it performs expected build steps.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors or mistakes are evident; functions perform their intended tasks.\n- **Scores:** The malware scores are all 0, which seems appropriate given the code. The obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low, reflecting the benign nature of the script.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Correctly set to 0 across all reports. No malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Correctly 0; no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk Score:** Appropriately low, given the operations are standard build procedures.\n\n### Potential points of concern:\n\n- The use of `os.remove`, `shutil.rmtree`, and `shutil.copytree` could, in theory, be misused if paths are manipulated, but here, paths are hardcoded and derived from the script's location, minimizing risk.\n- No dynamic execution or external input is involved, reducing attack surface.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **The code is a standard, safe setup script.**\n- **No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.**\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal filesystem operations; typical for build scripts, but always good to monitor in case of misconfiguration)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nAll reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n\n- Maintain current scoring.\n- Continue monitoring for any dynamic or untrusted inputs in future versions.\n- Ensure that filesystem operations are only performed in controlled environments.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks.",
