  "purpose": "Setup script for the pytype package, configuring build options, copying typeshed files, and including package data.",
  "sources": "Reading files (README.md, filesystem checks and copies), importing modules, glob patterns for package data.",
  "sinks": "Filesystem operations (os.remove, shutil.rmtree, shutil.copytree), glob.glob for file pattern matching.",
  "flows": "Filesystem checks and modifications occur in copy_typeshed() and scan_package_data(). The setup process also reads files for description.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious dynamic code. The code performs standard setup and file handling operations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup tasks: importing modules, defining helper functions, copying directories, scanning for data files, and reading a README file. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are present. Files are copied or removed only within the package directory structure, and no network activity or external communication occurs. The pattern matching and file copying are typical for setup scripts, with no malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Python package setup file that manages build data and filesystem operations without any malicious behavior. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. All operations are typical for setup procedures.",
