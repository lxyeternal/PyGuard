  "purpose": "Models VM state, frames, and control flow for static analysis purposes, managing variable stacks, CFG nodes, and condition handling.",
  "sources": "Reads from function parameters, code objects, CFG nodes, variables, and attribute handlers.",
  "sinks": "Modifies variables, CFG nodes, attributes, and internal data structures; no external data exfiltration or system interaction.",
  "flows": "Data flows through variable bindings, CFG manipulations, and condition checks within static analysis constructs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard static analysis framework component, managing VM state, CFG control flow, and symbolic conditions. It uses common patterns like special constants for signaling and maintains internal data structures for control flow and variable tracking. No external network, file, or malicious activity is present. The complexity is typical for such tools, with no signs of obfuscation or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured static analysis component with no malicious intent or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1), justified by its internal modeling purpose.",
