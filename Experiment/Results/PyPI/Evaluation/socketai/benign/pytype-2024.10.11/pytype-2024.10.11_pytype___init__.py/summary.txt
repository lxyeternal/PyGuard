  "conclusion": "Report 2 indicates high suspicion due to obfuscation and dynamic code execution, warranting a malware score of approximately 0.7 and a security risk of 0.85. Other reports correctly identify benign code with low scores. Overall, the scoring is consistent with the evidence; minor adjustments (reducing malware score slightly) are recommended if no malicious payloads are confirmed. The analysis confirms that only report 2 warrants high concern, while others are safe."
