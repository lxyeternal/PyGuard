  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, obfuscation techniques, dynamic execution points, hardcoded secrets, suspicious patterns, input/output handling.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file operations, environment variable access, dynamic code execution, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or network inputs flow into processing functions, with potential malicious payloads executed or data leaked at sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscation (base64, eval/exec), hardcoded credentials, suspicious dynamic code execution, unusual variable naming, or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is examined for suspicious patterns, obfuscation techniques, and malicious indicators. High suspicion is assigned if obfuscation and dynamic execution are confirmed, especially with hardcoded secrets. Benign code with standard practices receives low scores. The reasoning aligns with the described behaviors, and scores are adjusted accordingly to reflect confidence and evidence.",
  "conclusion": "Report 2 indicates high suspicion due to obfuscation and dynamic code execution, warranting a malware score of approximately 0.7 and a security risk of 0.85. Other reports correctly identify benign code with low scores. Overall, the scoring is consistent with the evidence; minor adjustments (reducing malware score slightly) are recommended if no malicious payloads are confirmed. The analysis confirms that only report 2 warrants high concern, while others are safe.",
