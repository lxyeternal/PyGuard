  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple script that performs some basic operations, possibly for demonstration or utility purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads data from standard input, environment variables, and possibly from imported modules or files.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to the console, files, or network destinations; potential data leaks if sensitive data is printed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Input sources feed into processing functions, which may then output or transmit data. No explicit flows identified due to lack of code details.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets observed. No obfuscated code, no unusual language features. Lack of comments makes intent unclear.",
  "analysis": "Initial review shows straightforward code with standard libraries. No suspicious API calls, network activity, or data handling anomalies detected. The code does not contain malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. Without additional context or code snippets, no malicious patterns are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or backdoors. Confidence in this assessment is moderate due to limited code details.",
