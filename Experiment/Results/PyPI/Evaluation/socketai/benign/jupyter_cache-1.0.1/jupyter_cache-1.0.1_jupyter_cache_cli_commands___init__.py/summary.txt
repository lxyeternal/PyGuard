  "conclusion": "The code is benign and primarily raises concerns about maintainability due to wildcard imports. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present. The low malware and obfuscated scores are justified. The slight security risk score reflects the potential for imported modules to contain hidden malicious code, but there is no direct evidence here. Overall, the security posture is low risk, with the main recommendation being to avoid wildcard imports for better security and clarity."
