  "purpose": "Utility functions for path manipulation, timing, and record formatting within a Jupyter caching context.",
  "sources": "Path inputs in functions like to_relative_paths and shorten_path; data structures in tabulate functions; lazy import of 'tabulate'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data transmission; functions operate on trusted data and handle exceptions locally.",
  "flows": "Input paths are converted to absolute, validated, and relative; data structures are formatted into tables; no external data flows or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic detected. Lazy import is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for path handling, timing, and tabulation, with responsible exception handling and no external network or malicious behavior. The lazy import of 'tabulate' is typical for performance. No untrusted data is processed in a dangerous manner. The functions are straightforward, well-structured, and do not contain obfuscation or hidden logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard utility operations without malicious intent or security risks. All signals indicate a safe, well-structured module suitable for its purpose.",
