{
  "purpose": "This code defines an abstract interface for a Jupyter notebook caching system, including data structures, exceptions, and method signatures for cache management, without concrete implementations.",
  "sources": "File reads via nbformat.read() for matching and diffing notebooks; data structures for cache records and project notebooks.",
  "sinks": "None; no data exfiltration, network activity, or untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Reading notebooks from file paths, passing data through method calls; no active data flows involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely abstract, defining interfaces and data models for cache management. It employs standard libraries and safe file operations. No executable logic, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. The use of nbformat.read() is for safe file reading, not code execution. The code's purpose is to serve as a contract for implementations, and it contains no embedded malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign, well-structured abstract interface for a Jupyter notebook cache system. It poses no security threat or malware risk based on the code itself. The scores should reflect the absence of malicious intent and obfuscation, with a very low security risk due to its abstract nature.",
