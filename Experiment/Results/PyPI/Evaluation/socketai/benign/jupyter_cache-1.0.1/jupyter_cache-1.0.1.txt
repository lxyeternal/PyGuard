The security risk is minimal, primarily due to the logical flaw, but it does not pose a security threat. Malware and obfuscation scores are zero, and overall security risk is very low."

The low malware and obfuscated scores are justified. The slight security risk score reflects the potential for imported modules to contain hidden malicious code, but there is no direct evidence here. Overall, the security posture is low risk, with the main recommendation being to avoid wildcard imports for better security and clarity."
