  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for managing cache paths with user interaction and environment variable support. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is detected. The risk score is minimal, primarily due to dynamic import and user prompts, which are common in CLI utilities. Overall, the code is safe for use, with no security concerns."
