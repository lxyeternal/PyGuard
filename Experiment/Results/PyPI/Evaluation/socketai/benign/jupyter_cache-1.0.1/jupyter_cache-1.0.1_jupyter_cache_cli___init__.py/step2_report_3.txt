  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, evaluating the reasoning, and assessing the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The code manages cache paths via environment variables and user prompts, with lazy cache creation. No suspicious or malicious code is detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.9 (but reported as 0). The confidence is high (0.9).\n- **Justification:** The reasoning is sound; no malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk score should be 0, matching the report.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, with environment variable and user prompts. No suspicious code or data leaks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1. The report assigns a low security risk, which seems reasonable.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior. The small security risk might be due to user prompts or environment variable exposure, but overall benign.\n- **Verdict:** Scores seem appropriate; no adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Dynamic import of 'jupyter_cache' is noted but not suspicious; it’s a common pattern.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2. Slightly higher, perhaps due to dynamic import, but still benign.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity. The dynamic import is typical for optional dependencies.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, with cache path management and user prompts.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.0. The report assigns zero security risk, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Manages cache directory with user prompts; no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1. Slightly elevated, possibly due to user interaction, but still low.\n- **Justification:** No malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious behavior is present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk Scores:** Mostly 0 or very low, reflecting benign utility code.\n\n### My Final Estimations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Clear, readable code.\n- **Risk Score:** **0** — The code is standard CLI utility with no security issues.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent, and their scores are justified based on the code review. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Estimated Score |\n|----------------|-----------------------|\n| Malware        | 0                     |\n| Obfuscated     | 0                     |\n| Security Risk  | 0                     |\n\nThis indicates the code is benign, with no security or malicious concerns.",
