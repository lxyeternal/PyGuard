  "purpose": "Manage and retrieve Python package entry points within specified groups, facilitating plugin discovery.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata via importlib_metadata/entry_points API.",
  "sinks": "None; read-only access to package metadata, no data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Retrieve all entry points, filter by group or name, return the entry point object.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard API usage with exception handling for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code safely accesses package entry points, handling different API versions without executing or modifying data. It does not perform any network activity, code injection, or data manipulation. No obfuscation or secrets are present. The logic is straightforward and aligns with standard plugin management practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for plugin entry point management with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to external package metadata trustworthiness, but within acceptable bounds.",
