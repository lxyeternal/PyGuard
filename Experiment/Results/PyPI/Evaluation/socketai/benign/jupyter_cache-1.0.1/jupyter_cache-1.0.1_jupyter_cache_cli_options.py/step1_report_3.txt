  "purpose": "Define command-line interface options and utility functions for a Jupyter notebook cache management tool.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (JUPYTERCACHE), user input via command-line options, file system paths, external package functions (list_readers, list_group_names).",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data is processed or executed directly from user input or external sources.",
  "flows": "Environment variable or command-line argument (cache path, notebook path, etc.) -> utility functions and options -> no further malicious data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. The code primarily sets up CLI options and callbacks without executing untrusted code or network operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines CLI options with associated callback functions for a notebook cache management utility. It reads configuration from environment variables and user input, with safety checks for user confirmation before destructive actions. No code injection, network communication, or malicious behavior is present. Usage of external functions appears to be legitimate and safe. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are evident. Overall, the code is standard CLI setup with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical CLI option setup for a Python application managing Jupyter notebooks. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code's purpose is to facilitate user interactions safely, with validation and confirmation prompts. Therefore, it is considered safe and free from supply chain or security threats.",
