  "purpose": "Provides functions to read notebook files via nbformat and jupytext, supporting plugin-based readers.",
  "sources": "File URIs for nbformat and jupytext; plugin entry points via get_entry_point.",
  "sinks": "Loading plugins which could execute arbitrary code if untrusted.",
  "flows": "URI inputs to nbformat.read or jupytext.read; plugin name to get_entry_point and load().",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code; standard import handling; plugin system could be exploited if plugins are malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, using standard libraries and safe dynamic import for jupytext. It supports plugin-based readers via entry points, which is a common pattern. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic are present. The main security concern is the plugin system, which could execute malicious code if untrusted plugins are installed. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk between 0.2-0.4) are consistent with this analysis. Given the potential for malicious plugins, a slightly higher risk score (around 0.3) is justified, but overall, the code itself is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured notebook reader supporting plugins. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The primary security concern is the plugin system, which could be exploited if untrusted plugins are used. The current scores are appropriate; a risk score of 0.3 reflects this well. No modifications are necessary.",
