  "purpose": "Provides functions to read notebook-like files using different formats and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads URI inputs for notebook files, imports nbformat and optionally jupytext, accesses entry point groups.",
  "sinks": "Returns notebook nodes, raises ImportError or ValueError, potentially loads plugins via get_entry_point.",
  "flows": "URI input -> read functions (nbf.read, jupytext.read) and plugin entry point -> return notebook nodes or raise errors.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import of jupytext, plugin-based reader retrieval, no hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code execution patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code loads notebook files using standard libraries (nbformat, jupytext) and plugin entry points. The optional import of jupytext is handled safely with try-except. Entry point functions are called to dynamically load custom readers, which is typical in plugin architectures. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or malicious code is evident. The functions perform expected operations for a notebook reader module, and error handling is straightforward. The plugin system could be misused if malicious plugins are provided, but this is a common and documented practice in Python extensibility. No obfuscated code or unusual behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured plugin-based notebook reading module without malicious intent or malicious code. The use of plugin entry points is typical and not inherently suspicious, assuming trusted plugin sources. No security risks or malware are apparent.",
