  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured notebook reader supporting plugins. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The primary security concern is the plugin system, which could be exploited if untrusted plugins are used. The current scores are appropriate; a risk score of 0.3 reflects this well. No modifications are necessary."
