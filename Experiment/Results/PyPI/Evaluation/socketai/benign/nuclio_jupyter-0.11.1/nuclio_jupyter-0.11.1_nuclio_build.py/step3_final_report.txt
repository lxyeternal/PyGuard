  "purpose": "Utility for building, packaging, and deploying code artifacts, especially notebooks and scripts, for serverless environments.",
  "sources": "Reads input from files, URLs, environment variables, and configuration data; downloads notebooks, reads code from temporary files, and loads configuration files.",
  "sinks": "Writes configuration and code to files, uploads archives, and updates deployment configurations.",
  "flows": "Sources (notebook URLs, code files, environment variables) feed into conversion and packaging functions, which then output archives or deployment configs, potentially involving uploads or file writes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns; subprocess calls to nbconvert are standard; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code detected; use of temporary files and environment variables is typical.",
  "analysis": "The code handles notebook conversion, code packaging, and deployment setup using standard libraries and practices. It performs external commands via subprocess, manages temporary files securely, and encodes data appropriately. No malicious payloads, network exfiltration, or suspicious behavior are present. The footer injection for function initialization is benign and intended for deployment. External inputs (URLs, environment variables) could be exploited if malicious, but the code itself does not contain malicious logic or backdoors. The overall structure and behavior are consistent with a legitimate deployment utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign utility for packaging and deploying code artifacts, with no evidence of malware or malicious intent. The low security risk score (0.2) is appropriate, considering potential misuse via external inputs, but no active malicious activity is detected. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly 0.",
