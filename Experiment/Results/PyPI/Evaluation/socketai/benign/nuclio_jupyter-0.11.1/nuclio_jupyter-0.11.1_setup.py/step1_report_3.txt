{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package named 'nuclio-jupyter' for distribution, including reading dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading files 'nuclio/__init__.py' for version, 'Pipfile' for dependencies, and 'README.md' for description.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that process untrusted input; setup parameters are static and controlled.",
  "flows": "File reading sources -> data parsing -> setup configuration, with no untrusted data execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Use of file reading and string manipulation appears normal.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs package setup tasks: extracting version info from a Python file, parsing dependency specifications from a Pipfile, reading a markdown README, and configuring setup parameters. No user input is processed, and there are no external calls or network operations. The code is straightforward, with no indications of malicious intent or malicious behaviors such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malware, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It is well-structured and safe.",
