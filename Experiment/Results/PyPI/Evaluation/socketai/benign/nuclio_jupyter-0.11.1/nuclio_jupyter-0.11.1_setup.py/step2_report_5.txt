  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a standard setup script for a Python package.\n- It reads version info from a Python file (`__init__.py`), dependencies from a `Pipfile`, and description from `README.md`.\n- No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The functions perform straightforward file reading and string parsing.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded credentials are detected.\n- The code appears safe, well-structured, and typical for package setup scripts.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  No. The code does not contain any vulnerabilities, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.\n\n### Flaws, errors, or mistakes:\n- **Potential concerns?**  \n  The only minor point is the use of `assert` in `load_deps()`. If assertions are disabled (via running Python with `-O`), dependency parsing might silently fail or skip critical validation. However, this is a common pattern and not inherently malicious.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  Slightly above zero (~0.1), possibly due to reliance on local files and parsing logic, but no actual security risk exists. This is acceptable.\n\n- **Confidence:**  \n  All reports show high confidence (1), which is justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Any inconsistencies or unreasonable scores?\n- The scores seem consistent with the analysis. No report assigns high malware or obfuscated scores, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (or very close to zero, given the minimal risk involved in reading static files and configuring setup)\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to minor potential issues with `assert` usage, but not malicious)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, safe setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The minor note about `assert` does not constitute a security concern but could be improved for robustness.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current low scores, with a slight note that the code is safe and typical for its purpose.",
