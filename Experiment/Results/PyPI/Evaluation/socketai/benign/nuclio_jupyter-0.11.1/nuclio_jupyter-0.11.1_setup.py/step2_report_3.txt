  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The report states that the script is a standard setup script with no malicious behavior, malware, or suspicious code. It correctly identifies that the script reads version info, dependencies, and description from trusted files without executing untrusted data.\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious intent. The confidence is high (1), and the malware score is 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** The report emphasizes that the script handles static files for dependencies and version info, with no untrusted data processing or network activity. It notes that the dependency parsing is simple and safe.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The security risk is minimal (0.1), which is reasonable given the file reading nature. Malware score remains 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, it confirms the script is a standard setup with no suspicious or malicious patterns. It highlights the absence of network activity or dynamic code execution.\n- **Assessment:** The confidence is high, malware score is 0, and the overall conclusion aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the script is a typical setup script, with no anomalies or suspicious activities. The use of assert for dependency parsing is noted but not considered malicious.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is accurate. No malicious behavior is detected, and the malware score remains 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Once again, confirms the script is a standard package setup, reading static files and configuring setup parameters without executing untrusted code.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent and correct. Malware score is 0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** Consistently 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is straightforward.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low, as the script only reads local files and sets up package metadata without executing untrusted code or performing network operations.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Scores:** Based on the analysis, I agree with the provided scores:\n  - **Malware:** 0\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0\n  - **Risk:** 0.1 (acceptable given the file reading operations, but not risky)\n\n- **Additional Considerations:** No further action needed. The code appears safe and legitimate.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a typical, well-structured Python package setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reported scores are accurate and justified.\n\n**Final Estimated Scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a more detailed breakdown or further analysis.",
