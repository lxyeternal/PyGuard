{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package, responsible for reading version info, dependencies, and description files to configure package installation.",
  "sources": "Reads version from 'nuclio/__init__.py', dependencies from 'Pipfile', description from 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or network activity; purely static file reading and string parsing.",
  "flows": "File reads and string parsing from local files to variables used in setup().",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'assert' in 'load_deps' could be disabled, potentially affecting dependency parsing, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script performs straightforward file I/O operations, extracting version, dependencies, and description without executing untrusted code or network operations. No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious code are present. The dependency parsing uses simple string operations and assertions, which are standard but could be disabled. Overall, the code is a typical setup script with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score (~0.1) reflects minimal concern due to file parsing operations, which is justified.",
