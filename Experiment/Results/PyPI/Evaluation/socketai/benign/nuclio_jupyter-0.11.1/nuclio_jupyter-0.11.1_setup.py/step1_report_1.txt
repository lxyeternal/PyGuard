  "purpose": "Setup script for the nuclio-jupyter package, defining dependencies, metadata, and entry points.",
  "sources": "File reads from 'nuclio/__init__.py' and 'Pipfile', reading 'README.md', and package setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data processed or used in sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from '__init__.py' -> Loads dependencies from 'Pipfile' -> Uses data in package setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual code patterns. The code appears standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script loads version information from '__init__.py', dependencies from 'Pipfile', and reads long description from 'README.md'. It uses standard Python packaging conventions and does not execute untrusted data or perform any network operations. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code elements are detected. The functions perform straightforward file reading and string parsing. All setup parameters appear legitimate. No obfuscated code, no code injection, and no suspicious data handling were observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a typical, safe configuration for packaging a Python project.",
