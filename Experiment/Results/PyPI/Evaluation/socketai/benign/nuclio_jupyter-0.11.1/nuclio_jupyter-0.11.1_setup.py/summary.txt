  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score (~0.1) reflects minimal concern due to file parsing operations, which is justified."
