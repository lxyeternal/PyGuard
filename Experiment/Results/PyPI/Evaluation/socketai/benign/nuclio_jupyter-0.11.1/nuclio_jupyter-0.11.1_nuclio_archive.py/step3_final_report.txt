  "purpose": "Utility functions for packaging, uploading, and managing code archives and repositories, primarily for deployment in Nuclio functions.",
  "sources": "Reads from files, environment variables, zip archives, network responses, and URLs.",
  "sinks": "Writes to filesystem, uploads to remote repositories, network endpoints, and creates ZIP files.",
  "flows": "Data flows from files/env variables/network sources to filesystem or remote storage via upload or write operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or malicious code; uses environment variables for credentials, which is standard; some methods unimplemented ('upload', 'put') that could cause operational issues but not malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of utility functions for managing deployment packages and repositories. It handles credentials via environment variables and URL parsing, which is typical but requires secure management. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malware are present. The unimplemented methods could lead to failures but do not indicate malicious intent. The credential handling is a potential operational concern but not malicious. Overall, the code appears legitimate and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign utility module for deployment and repository management with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attack vectors. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2-0.3) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
