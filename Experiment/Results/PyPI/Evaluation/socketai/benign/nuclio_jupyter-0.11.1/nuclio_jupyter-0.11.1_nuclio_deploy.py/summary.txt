  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate deployment utility for Nuclio functions, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the disabled SSL verification (VERIFY_CERT=False), which should be addressed for production environments. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; I would slightly increase the security risk score to around 0.3 to reflect this configuration issue, but overall, the code appears benign and well-structured."
