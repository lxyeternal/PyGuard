  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the technical details, potential security implications, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code manages Nuclio functions via API calls, status polling, and configuration management. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. Environment variables are used for internal URL resolution, which is standard.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis; no malicious behavior observed.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — reasonable, considering standard deployment scripts often rely on environment variables and API interactions.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion and scores are consistent. No issues found.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on deployment, management, and API interactions. Environment variables and dynamic URL constructions are used, but no malicious intent is evident.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate; no malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — acceptable, given the reliance on environment variables and network requests.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound, and scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code performs deployment with API calls, status polling, and configuration. Notably, it disables SSL verification globally (`VERIFY_CERT = False`), which is a security concern. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent; no malware detected.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.4 — higher than previous reports due to insecure SSL verification, which can be exploited in untrusted environments.\n\n- **Assessment:** The elevated security risk score is justified. The report correctly identifies the insecure SSL setting as a potential security concern, but it does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Manages functions/projects via API, environment variables, and URL generation. Uses `verify=False` for SSL, which is insecure. Environment variables like `IGZ_NAMESPACE_DOMAIN` are used for internal URL construction, which could leak internal addresses if environment is compromised.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity or backdoors.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — the insecure SSL verification is a concern but not malicious.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; the security risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar deployment and management code, with environment variables, API interactions, and file handling. Uses `VERIFY_CERT = False`, which is insecure but not malicious.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware detected.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — consistent with other reports; insecure SSL verification is noted.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the scores.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, indicating no malicious code or behavior detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated Scores:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the code clarity and lack of obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk Scores:** Vary from 0.2 to 0.4, primarily due to the use of `verify=False` in SSL requests, which is a security concern but not malware.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent and justified based on the detailed analyses.\n\n- The primary security concern across multiple reports is the disabling of SSL verification (`VERIFY_CERT = False`), which should be addressed in production environments.\n\n- No evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscated code was found.\n\n---\n\n### My Personal Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — the code appears benign and purpose-driven for deployment management.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — primarily due to insecure SSL verification, which is a configuration issue rather than an attack vector.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a legitimate deployment utility with standard API interactions. The main security improvement would be enabling SSL verification (`VERIFY_CERT = True`) for secure communications.",
