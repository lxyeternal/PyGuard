  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code manages Nuclio functions via API calls, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors. Environment variables are used for internal URL resolution, which is standard.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — indicates minor concerns, likely due to standard environment variable usage.\n\n- **Comments:** The reasoning is sound. The code appears legitimate, with no signs of sabotage or malware.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing deployment, environment variables, and API interactions. No malicious code detected. Mentions potential risks if environment variables are compromised.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent with the analysis.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — reflects typical deployment scripts' risks, especially if environment variables are compromised.\n\n- **Comments:** The reasoning is balanced. No obfuscation or malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights standard deployment functions but notes that SSL verification is disabled globally (`VERIFY_CERT = False`), which is a security concern. Also points out internal URL patterns and the use of environment variables.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious code, just insecure configuration.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.4 — higher due to the insecure SSL verification, which could be exploited in a man-in-the-middle attack.\n\n- **Comments:** The reasoning correctly identifies the security concern but does not suggest malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** The higher security risk score is justified. No malware detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on standard API interactions, environment variables, and deployment workflows. Notes that SSL verification is disabled (`VERIFY_CERT=False`) as a security concern but not malicious.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — aligns with the insecure SSL setting but not malicious.\n\n- **Comments:** The reasoning is sound; the code appears legitimate.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, emphasizing standard deployment functions, environment variables, and API calls. Notes the insecure SSL verification (`VERIFY_CERT=False`) but no malicious activity.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware detected.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — consistent with the insecure SSL setting.\n\n- **Comments:** The reasoning is valid; no malicious behavior observed.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.\n\n- **Obfuscated Scores:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly elevated (0.2 to 0.4) mainly due to insecure SSL verification (`VERIFY_CERT=False`) and environment variable usage for internal URL resolution, which are common in deployment scripts but could be exploited if environment is compromised.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the detailed reasoning. No adjustments needed.\n\n- The security risk could be marginally increased if considering the insecure SSL verification as a significant security concern, but given the context, 0.4 is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n\n- **Risk:** 0.2 to 0.4 — primarily due to insecure SSL verification (`VERIFY_CERT=False`). For production, this should be addressed, but it does not constitute malware or malicious intent.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, well-reasoned, and the scores align with the analysis. The code appears to be a legitimate deployment utility with typical security considerations.",
