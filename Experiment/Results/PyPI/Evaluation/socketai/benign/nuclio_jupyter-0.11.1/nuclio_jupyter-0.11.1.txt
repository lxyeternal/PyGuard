The primary security concern is the disabled SSL verification (VERIFY_CERT=False), which should be addressed for production environments. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; I would slightly increase the security risk score to around 0.3 to reflect this configuration issue, but overall, the code appears benign and well-structured."

It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the execution of untrusted input, which can be mitigated with proper validation. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2-0.4) are justified and consistent with the analysis."

The low security risk score (0.2) is appropriate, considering potential misuse via external inputs, but no active malicious activity is detected. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly 0."
