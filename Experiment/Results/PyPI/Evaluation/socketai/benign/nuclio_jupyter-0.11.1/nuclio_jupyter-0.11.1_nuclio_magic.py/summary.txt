  "conclusion": "The code is a management utility for Nuclio functions in Jupyter notebooks, executing commands and modifying environment variables based on user input. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the execution of untrusted input, which can be mitigated with proper validation. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2-0.4) are justified and consistent with the analysis."
