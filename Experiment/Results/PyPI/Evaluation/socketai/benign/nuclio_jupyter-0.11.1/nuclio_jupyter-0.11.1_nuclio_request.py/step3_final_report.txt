{
  "purpose": "Utility classes and functions for logging, event parsing, environment detection, and context management in serverless or notebook environments.",
  "sources": "Environment variables ('NUCLIO_FUNCTION_INSTANCE'), JSON data, base64-encoded bodies, standard input/output streams.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or network calls; data decoding with exception handling prevents leaks or injections.",
  "flows": "Input data (JSON/base64) is decoded and parsed; environment variables influence context setup; logging handlers are configured but do not transmit data externally.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; lazy attribute access in Context is unconventional but benign; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility module with safe exception handling, benign environment checks, and standard logging setup. No malicious payloads, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The environment detection for Jupyter and context injection are typical patterns. The decoding functions handle errors properly, and no suspicious data flows are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing assessments assigning malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and low security risk (~0.1-0.2) are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
