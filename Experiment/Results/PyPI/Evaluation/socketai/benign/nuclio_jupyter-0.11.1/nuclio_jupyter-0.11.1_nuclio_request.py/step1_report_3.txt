{
  "purpose": "This code provides logging, event handling, and context management functionalities for a Python application, likely used in a serverless or cloud environment.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (os.environ), base64 decoding of input data, JSON data (json.loads and json.dumps), potential external IPython module for runtime detection.",
  "sinks": "Logging output to stdout via StreamHandler, decoding and processing of event body data, setting global context object, accessing environment variables.",
  "flows": "Environment variable check → context creation → potential base64 decoding of event body → logging messages with formatted output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. The code performs standard logging and event parsing functions. The only noteworthy aspect is the dynamic creation of a global 'context' object when running inside a Jupyter Notebook, which is a benign runtime check.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly manages logging configurations, context setup, and event data parsing. It uses environment variables and JSON data safely, with proper exception handling during base64 decoding. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command injection, or backdoors. The dynamic injection of a 'context' object in Jupyter Notebook is standard practice for facilitating development or testing environments. No suspicious network activity, credential handling, or obfuscated code present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard utility code for managing logging, event parsing, and runtime context. No malicious intent or security threats are apparent. It appears safe and appropriate for use in a cloud or serverless environment.",
