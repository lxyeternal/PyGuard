  "purpose": "Configuration classes for Nuclio triggers, managing environment variables for hostnames and access credentials.",
  "sources": "Environment variables ('IGZ_NAMESPACE_DOMAIN', 'V3IO_ACCESS_KEY') and constructor parameters for configuration inputs.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of environment variables for secrets, but no data leaks or untrusted data flows detected.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence hostname augmentation and access keys; no malicious data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "Minor typo in canary validation ('ve' instead of 'be'), but not security relevant; no malicious or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines trigger configuration classes with input validation and environment variable reliance. No malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors are detected. Use of environment variables for secrets is standard but requires secure environment management. Input validation appears appropriate, and no suspicious network activity or data exfiltration is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate configuration utility for Nuclio triggers, with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain attack vectors. The low security risk score (0.2) is appropriate given reliance on environment variables for secrets, which is common but warrants secure environment handling.",
