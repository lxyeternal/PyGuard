  "flows": "Initialization flow from import to context injection, then cleanup",
  "anomalies": "Use of _inject_context() and its subsequent deletion; no suspicious code or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The _inject_context() function's purpose is likely environment or context setup, which is common in SDKs. No external data handling, network activity, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code's simplicity and lack of obfuscation support a benign assessment. The only potential concern is the _inject_context() call, but without its implementation, it cannot be deemed malicious. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign SDK initialization module with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The minimal risk score reflects the presence of context setup, which is typical and not suspicious. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
