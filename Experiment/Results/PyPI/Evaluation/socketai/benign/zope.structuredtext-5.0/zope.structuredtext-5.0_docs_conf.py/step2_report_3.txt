  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a static configuration script for Sphinx, with no dynamic or malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — consistent and reasonable.  \n- **Conclusion:** No issues; the report's reasoning aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Assessment:** Accurately notes the code reads package version info via pkg_resources and performs standard configuration. No suspicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is sound and consistent.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Assessment:** Also correctly states the code is standard configuration, with no external communication or dynamic code execution.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** Well justified.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous, identifies no malicious activity or obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — consistent.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Assessment:** Slightly more cautious, assigns a small security risk (0.1) and obfuscation (0), noting the use of 'pkg_resources.require' as standard.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 — acceptable, given the minimal concern.  \n- **Conclusion:** Slightly conservative but still reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Justification:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a static configuration script for Sphinx documentation, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- The scores assigned (malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, security risk = 0 or very close) are appropriate.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security vulnerabilities is present.\n\n---\n\n**My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward and static.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — negligible security risk, as the code only performs configuration tasks.\n\n**Final notes:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign Sphinx configuration file with no signs of security issues or malicious intent. The reports are consistent and justified.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security risk: 0\n\nAll evaluations are aligned with the code's behavior.",
