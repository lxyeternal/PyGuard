  "purpose": "Configuration script for building documentation of the 'zope.structuredtext' project using Sphinx.",
  "sources": "Imports os, sys, pkg_resources; accesses package metadata; appends to sys.path.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data transmissions; no network connections, file writes, or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Imports and package requirements are read at startup; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code activities; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation observed. The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical setup tasks for Sphinx documentation generation, including setting paths, project info, theme options, and intersphinx mappings. It reads package metadata via pkg_resources.require and adjusts sys.path accordingly. All code appears to be static configuration with no dynamic code execution or network activity. No anomalies, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It solely manages documentation build settings. Overall security risk is negligible.",
