{
  "purpose": "The code provides a read-only implementation of DOM interfaces and node classes for StructuredText, including node types, exceptions, and utility methods for navigating and accessing nodes.",
  "sources": "The code reads node data through methods like getChildren(), getNodeValue(), getAttribute(), and properties such as self._value, self.name, and self.value.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include methods that return node data, such as getNodeValue(), getAttribute(), getAttributes(), and getChildren(). No data is directly written or sent over the network.",
  "flows": "Data flows from internal attributes (like self._value, self.name, self.value) accessed by getters, through methods returning node content or attribute collections, with no untrusted external input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is primarily a structural DOM implementation with placeholders raising NotImplementedError, indicating incomplete or abstract methods. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants for node types and exceptions, along with classes implementing a read-only DOM model. Many methods raise NotImplementedError, suggesting this is a base or abstract implementation intended for extension. The NodeWrapper provides parent access without circular references, and navigation methods rely on node attributes and stored indices. No external input handling, network activity, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code does not perform any data processing beyond node attribute access or structural navigation, and there are no signs of code injection, data leaks, or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a structural DOM implementation for read-only operations, with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It functions as a library or base class structure for DOM nodes and exceptions. No malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
