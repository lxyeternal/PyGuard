  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a structural implementation of DOM classes, constants, and exceptions for read-only structured text processing.\n- Many methods raise NotImplementedError, indicating incomplete or base classes meant for extension.\n- No external data input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are evident.\n- The code appears to be a standard, benign library for DOM representation.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Implementation of DOM interfaces, read-only.\n- **Findings:** No external input, no malicious logic, placeholder methods, no suspicious activity.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No issues found. The high confidence and zero malware/risk scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose:** DOM structure for structured text, read-only.\n- **Findings:** No input/output, no malicious code, placeholder methods, incomplete but benign.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** 0.2 (securityRisk), 0 (malware)\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.2) reflects the incomplete nature (methods raising NotImplementedError), but no malicious activity. The malware score remains 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose:** DOM-like structure, no external input.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior, placeholder methods, standard structure.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** 0, 0.2 (securityRisk)\n\n**Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose:** Read-only DOM, no external input.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, no dynamic code execution, placeholder methods.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** 0, 0\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose:** Read-only DOM, no external input.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, no external data processing, placeholder methods.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** 0.2 (securityRisk), 0\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher securityRisk due to incomplete methods, but no malware. Scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\n\n- **Code presence of malicious or obfuscated code:** None detected.\n- **Malware risk:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the code's structure.\n- **Obfuscation:** 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** Mostly 0 or very low (0.2), justified by incomplete methods but no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minor concern due to incomplete methods, but overall very safe.\n\n**Final note:** The code appears to be a standard, benign DOM library with no security threats. The low risk and malware scores are justified.",
