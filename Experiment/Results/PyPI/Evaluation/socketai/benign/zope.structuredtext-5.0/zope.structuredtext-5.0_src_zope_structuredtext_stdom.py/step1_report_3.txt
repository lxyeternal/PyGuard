{
  "purpose": "The code implements a DOM-like structure for structured text, defining node types, exceptions, and classes for DOM nodes, attributes, and collections.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources are present; code mainly defines classes and constants. getChildren() method (to be implemented in subclasses) may provide access to child nodes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or output operations are defined. Methods like getAttribute, getElementsByTagName, or node value access are present but do not perform external data transmission or execution.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows, as the code is structural, providing DOM object models without external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are evident. The code uses standard class definitions, inheritance, and placeholder methods raising NotImplementedError. No obfuscation, code injection, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines DOM node classes and exceptions for structured text manipulation. Methods are primarily placeholders or simple attribute accessors. No external input, output, or network operations are present. The code appears to be a straightforward, conventional implementation of a DOM API without malicious intent. The use of NotImplementedError suggests it's meant to be extended or used as a library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or sabotage. Overall, it seems to be a standard, benign structural code for DOM representations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard DOM-like implementation with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It serves as a library foundation for structured text DOM manipulation, with no evidence of sabotage or malware.",
