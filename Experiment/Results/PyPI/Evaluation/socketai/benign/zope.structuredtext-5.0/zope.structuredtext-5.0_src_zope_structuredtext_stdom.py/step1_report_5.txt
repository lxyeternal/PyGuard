{
  "purpose": "The code defines a read-only DOM implementation in StructuredText, providing classes and methods to represent and manipulate DOM nodes and collections without modifications.",
  "sources": "No explicit sources of external input or data reading are present; the code primarily defines classes and constants.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include methods that could process or output node data, but none directly process untrusted input or output data to external systems.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted data; the code does not handle or process external inputs that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes typical class and method structures for DOM-like representations. No suspicious or unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are present. The getChildNodes and getFirstChild methods use default parameters that are not utilized internally, which is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured DOM implementation with classes for Nodes, Elements, Attributes, and collections such as NodeList and NamedNodeMap. It primarily defines data structures and accessor methods. There is no code that executes external commands, reads external input, or writes data externally. The methods that raise NotImplementedError suggest that this is a partial or base implementation. No dynamic code execution, eval, or reflection is used. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, read-only DOM class implementation that defines node types, exceptions, and basic node operations without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a legitimate, non-malicious library intended for DOM manipulation. No security threats or malware signals are detected.",
