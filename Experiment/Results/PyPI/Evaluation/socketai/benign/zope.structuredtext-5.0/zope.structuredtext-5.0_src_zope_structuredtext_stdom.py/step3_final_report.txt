{
  "purpose": "Implementation of a read-only DOM structure for StructuredText, providing classes, constants, and exceptions for DOM manipulation.",
  "sources": "Methods like getChildren(), getChildNodes(), getParentNode(), and attribute accessors that read class attributes or method return values.",
  "sinks": "No external data input, network communication, or data output; no sinks for untrusted data or system effects are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to internal attribute access and method calls within class instances; no external or untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "Methods raise NotImplementedError, indicating incomplete or abstract classes; default parameters like 'type=type' and 'sts=str' are unused internally but are not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants, exception classes, and DOM node classes with placeholder methods, suggesting a structural or base library. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious logic is present. The code is purely structural, with no network activity or data leaks. The use of NotImplementedError indicates incomplete implementation, but this does not imply malicious intent. The code is straightforward and aligns with standard DOM interface definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, structural implementation of DOM classes for read-only structured text processing. It contains no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The existing reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
