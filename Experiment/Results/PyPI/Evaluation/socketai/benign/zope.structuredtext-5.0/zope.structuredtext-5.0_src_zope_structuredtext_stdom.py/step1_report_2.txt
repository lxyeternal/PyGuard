{
  "purpose": "The code implements a DOM (Document Object Model) structure for structured text processing, providing classes and constants for nodes, exceptions, and collections used in read-only DOM manipulation.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources such as user input, network, or file I/O are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks such as network transmission, file writing, or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is purely structural and defines classes and constants.",
  "anomalies": "Some methods raise NotImplementedError, indicating incomplete implementation, but no suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated logic are observed. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of constants, exception classes, and DOM node classes for a read-only DOM implementation. It includes classes for node wrappers, parent nodes, element nodes, text nodes, attribute nodes, node lists, and named node maps. The methods primarily provide interfaces or placeholders, with some methods like getChildren() and getParentNode() raising NotImplementedError. The getChildNodes method converts child data into node objects, but no dynamic code execution, external data handling, or suspicious behaviors are found. The structure appears standard for a DOM implementation, with no malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a structural implementation of a read-only DOM API with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It mainly consists of class and constant definitions, with placeholder methods indicating incomplete features. No suspicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.",
