{
  "purpose": "Define character classes and functions for structured text processing, including generating punctuation patterns for parsing or validation.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the 'string' module, specifically 'string.punctuation', 'string.digits', and 'string.ascii_letters'.",
  "targets": "Generates regular expression-compatible strings for punctuation characters, but does not directly process untrusted data or perform I/O.",
  "flows": "The function 'punc_func' constructs strings from 'string.punctuation' based on exclude parameters; no data flows from external sources into sensitive sinks or network endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. The code solely constructs character classes and does not perform any data handling, network communication, or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script defines utility functions and variables for text parsing, utilizing standard library features. It does not include any user input handling, data output, or external interactions. No hardcoded secrets or malicious logic are present. The use of string manipulation for character classes appears safe and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility module for character class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs no suspicious operations or data handling that could compromise security.",
