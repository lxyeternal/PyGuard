{
  "purpose": "Define character classes and functions for processing structured text, specifically handling punctuation exclusion and categorizing characters.",
  "sources": "Importing string module, using string.punctuation, string.digits, and string.ascii_letters.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform I/O operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the function constructs regex character classes from static data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; the function punc_func dynamically constructs regex patterns but does so based solely on static string data.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the string module and defines a function punc_func that creates regex character classes by concatenating punctuation characters not in an exclude list. It also defines several character classes for digits, letters, and various punctuation groups. All operations are static and do not involve user input or external data. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility module for text processing with no malicious intent or security risks. It constructs character classes for regex use based on static strings only. No vulnerabilities or malware are detected.",
