{
  "purpose": "Define character classes and functions for structured text processing, particularly generating regex-like strings for punctuation and delimiters.",
  "sources": "The code reads string constants (string.punctuation, string.digits, string.ascii_letters) and function parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling; the code does not process external input or output data.",
  "flows": "The function punc_func generates strings based on character exclusions, but these are static and do not involve untrusted data or external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs straightforward string manipulations and character set definitions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard string constants and defines a function to generate regex-like character classes excluding certain characters. The function constructs strings by concatenating escaped characters, but does not perform any I/O, network activity, or dynamic code execution. All variables and functions are static, with no indication of malicious intent or obfuscated logic. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present in this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for text processing with no signs of malware or security risks. It simply defines character sets and functions for regex pattern construction.",
