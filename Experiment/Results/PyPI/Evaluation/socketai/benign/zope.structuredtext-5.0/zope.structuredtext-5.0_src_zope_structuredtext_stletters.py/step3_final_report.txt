{
  "purpose": "The code defines utility functions and variables for constructing regex character class strings for text processing, specifically handling punctuation, digits, and letters.",
  "sources": "Static data from the string module and hardcoded strings; no external input or dynamic data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only constructs static regex pattern strings without processing untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Static function calls generating regex pattern strings; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, static, and well-structured with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the string module, defines a function to generate regex character classes excluding specified characters, and creates several pattern strings for punctuation and delimiters. It does not process external input, perform I/O, or execute dynamic code. The logic is simple, static, and intended for text parsing. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. Confidence is high (1), given the straightforward analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for regex pattern construction with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports accurately assess this, and no modifications are necessary.",
