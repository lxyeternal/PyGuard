  "purpose": "Declare the current package as a namespace package using pkg_resources",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'pkg_resources' module and calls 'declare_namespace' with '__name__'",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leakage or malicious actions are present",
  "flows": "Import of 'pkg_resources' → call to 'declare_namespace' with '__name__'",
  "anomalies": "Use of '__import__' with a string argument is uncommon but not inherently malicious; no suspicious behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports the 'pkg_resources' module, then calls 'declare_namespace' to declare the current package as a namespace package. This is a standard practice in Python packaging for namespace packages, especially when used with pkg_resources. There are no signs of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code execution. The code is minimal and straightforward, serving a packaging purpose without any anomalies or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical namespace declaration using 'pkg_resources' and does not exhibit any malicious behavior. It is a legitimate packaging pattern.",
