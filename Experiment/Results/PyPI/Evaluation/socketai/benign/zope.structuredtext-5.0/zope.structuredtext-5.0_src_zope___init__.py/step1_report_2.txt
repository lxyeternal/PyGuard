  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard namespace declaration pattern",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports the pkg_resources module and calls declare_namespace() with __name__ to set up namespace package functionality. This is a common pattern in Python for managing namespace packages and does not involve handling untrusted data or performing any suspicious actions. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no indications of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace package declaration using pkg_resources. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this snippet.",
