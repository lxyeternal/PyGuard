  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Importing pkg_resources leads to namespace declaration; no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkg_resources' module and declares the current package as a namespace package using 'declare_namespace'. This is a standard method for namespace package setup, commonly used in Python package distributions. No input or output data, no network activity, and no suspicious code behaviors are present. The code is minimal and straightforward with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical namespace declaration in a Python package. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks.",
