  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs are involved.",
  "flows": "Import of 'pkg_resources' leads to declaration of namespace, no data flow involved.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a minimal, standard namespace declaration with no suspicious or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkg_resources' module and calls 'declare_namespace(__name__)' to declare the current package as a namespace package. This is a common pattern used in Python packages that span multiple distributions, especially in namespace package configurations. No input/output operations, data leaks, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are present. There are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace declaration using 'pkg_resources' with no malicious or security concerns identified.",
