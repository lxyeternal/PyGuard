  "purpose": "Declare a namespace package in Python using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "Dynamic import of 'pkg_resources' and call to declare_namespace(__name__).",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "Import 'pkg_resources' -> call declare_namespace(__name__) without data flow or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward namespace declaration with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard pattern for defining namespace packages in Python, using __import__ to dynamically load 'pkg_resources' and calling declare_namespace(__name__). All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's function. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are present. The code is minimal, well-understood, and poses no threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign namespace declaration pattern in Python. All reports are accurate, and the scores reflect the absence of malicious intent or vulnerabilities. No modifications are necessary.",
