{
  "purpose": "Declare a namespace package using pkg_resources",
  "sources": "The __import__('pkg_resources') statement imports the pkg_resources module; the declare_namespace function is called with __name__",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external communication are present",
  "flows": "Import of pkg_resources leads to namespace declaration, no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, only namespace declaration; no suspicious or unusual patterns, no hardcoded credentials or backdoors",
  "analysis": "The code imports the pkg_resources module dynamically and declares a namespace package using __name__, which is a standard practice for creating namespace packages. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. The code is very minimal and performs a legitimate function in Python packaging.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard namespace declaration using pkg_resources. It poses no security risk or malicious intent based on its content.",
