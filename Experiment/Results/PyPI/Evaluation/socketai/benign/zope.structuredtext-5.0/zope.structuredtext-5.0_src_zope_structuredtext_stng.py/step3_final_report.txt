{
  "purpose": "The code implements a hierarchical document model with parsing, structuring, and display functions for text and markup elements, primarily from input strings and class attributes.",
  "sources": "Input strings (paragraphs), class attributes, and internal method calls for parsing and display.",
  "sinks": "Output via print statements; no external data transmission or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input strings through parsing functions into structured objects, then to display functions that output to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a document processing library with classes representing paragraphs, sections, tables, and markup elements. It uses regex for indentation detection and string splitting for parsing. No external network or file I/O, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscation are present. The functions perform hierarchical structuring and display, typical for such libraries. No suspicious patterns or malicious logic are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured document processing module with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
