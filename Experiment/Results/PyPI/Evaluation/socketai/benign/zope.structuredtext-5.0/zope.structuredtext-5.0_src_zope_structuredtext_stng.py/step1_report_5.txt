{
  "purpose": "The code defines a set of classes and functions for representing and manipulating structured text documents, including paragraphs, tables, and markup elements.",
  "sources": "No explicit external data sources; internal data is processed from method parameters and object attributes.",
  "sinks": "Output is primarily to standard output via print statements in display functions; no other data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from external sources to output sinks; data flows are confined within object attributes and method parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns; no obfuscated code or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily provides a structured representation of text, including nested paragraphs, tables, and markup elements, with functions to parse, flatten, and display this structure. No code segments interact with external networks, files, or untrusted inputs in a manner that could lead to security issues. Display functions output to standard output, which is safe. The code appears to be a well-structured document model without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign structured text document model with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It operates solely on internal data structures and provides display and parsing functionality. No vulnerabilities or malicious actions are evident.",
