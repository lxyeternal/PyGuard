  "purpose": "Standard setup script for the zope.structuredtext package, defining package metadata, dependencies, and reading documentation files.",
  "sources": "Reads local files 'README.rst' and 'CHANGES.rst' for long description; static package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, network activity, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "Reading local files to assemble long description; static data passed to setup().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, static setup script with no suspicious logic or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script for packaging, performing static file reads and passing fixed metadata to setuptools. No dynamic or malicious behavior is evident. The code is clear, with no obfuscation, no network calls, and no untrusted data handling. The scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe package setup script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The provided scores are appropriate, and the overall supply chain risk is negligible.",
