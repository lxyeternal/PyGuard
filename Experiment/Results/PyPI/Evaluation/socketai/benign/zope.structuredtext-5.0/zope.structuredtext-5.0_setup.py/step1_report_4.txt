  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the zope.structuredtext package, including package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' and 'CHANGES.rst' files for long description; importing modules; reading package files during setup.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data; no network, file, or system command execution based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted data; primarily file reads for documentation and package setup variables.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected. The code strictly adheres to standard package setup patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and reads documentation files for long description. It defines package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. The functions and setup parameters follow standard practices without any code that could be malicious or maliciously obfuscated. There are no dynamic executions, network connections, or data leaks. The code is a typical package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard setup configuration script for a Python package with no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It performs typical package setup tasks safely.",
