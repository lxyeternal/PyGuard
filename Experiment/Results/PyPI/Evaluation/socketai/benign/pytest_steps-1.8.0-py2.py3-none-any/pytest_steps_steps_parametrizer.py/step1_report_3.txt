{
  "purpose": "This code provides decorators and utility functions for managing test steps in pytest, including parameterization, dependencies, and manual execution.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, functools, inspect, makefun, pytest, and local modules; function parameters; class attributes; global variables.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the dynamic creation of fixtures, the execution of test functions, and handling of dependencies could be manipulated, but no direct unsafe data sinks like network, file system, or environment variable operations are present.",
  "flows": "Imports → Function definitions and class declarations → Decorator application for test steps → Conditional execution and dependency management → Dynamic fixture creation and test execution.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically creates fixtures and wraps test functions, which could be exploited if manipulated, but there are no suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Use of lru_cache and dynamic signature modification are typical for pytest plugins.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages test steps, dependencies, and parameterization within pytest. It dynamically creates fixtures, uses caching, and manipulates function signatures for flexible test execution. No malicious code such as network operations, data exfiltration, or backdoors is present. The code does not handle untrusted input directly, nor does it contain code injection points. Its complexity and dynamic features are consistent with a pytest extension for managing test workflows. No anomalies indicating sabotage or malware are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard pytest extension module designed for structured test step management. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on the provided analysis.",
