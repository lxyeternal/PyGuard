{
  "purpose": "This code provides a framework for managing and executing test steps in pytest, including dependency management, parameterization, and data sharing across test steps.",
  "sources": "Reads import statements, function parameters, and class attributes. It also reads input via decorators, function arguments, and request objects during test execution.",
  "sinks": "Uses pytest fixtures, function calls, and attribute setting to manage test state and dependencies. No direct untrusted data sinks like network connections or file writes are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (decorators, parameters, request objects) through internal functions managing test step execution, dependencies, and shared data holders.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspiciously obfuscated code detected. Use of dynamic code features (like add_signature_parameters, getmodule) are standard for pytest extensions. No hidden or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a pytest extension designed to facilitate stepwise test execution with dependency management and parameterization. It includes mechanisms for caching shared state via lru_cache, dynamically creating fixtures, and controlling execution flow based on dependencies. All imported modules are standard or common third-party libraries used in pytest extensions. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network activity, file manipulation, or data exfiltration. The code performs legitimate testing orchestration tasks, with no indications of sabotage or malware. No suspicious obfuscation or malicious control flow detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard pytest extension module for managing test steps and dependencies. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It is intended to facilitate structured test execution with dependency checks and shared state management, with no malicious intent identified.",
