{
  "purpose": "This code provides decorators and utility functions for managing and executing test steps in pytest, including parameterization, dependency management, and manual execution controls.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (sys, functools, inspect), third-party modules (pytest, makefun, funcsigs, functools32), and local modules (.steps_common). No external inputs are read directly from external sources or user inputs.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the code defines decorators and functions that manipulate test functions and fixtures but do not perform data leaks or sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data sources flow into dangerous sinks; the flow is primarily internal control and decoration of test functions and fixtures within pytest.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets are present. The code uses standard techniques for decorators, caching, and dynamic function modification. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or hidden behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines test management utilities for pytest, including parameterization, dependency checks, and manual execution features. It uses standard libraries and well-known third-party modules to manipulate test functions. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The only dynamic behavior involves creating fixtures and wrapping test functions, which is standard for pytest extensions. No suspicious network or file operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate pytest extension aimed at facilitating structured test steps with dependencies and parameterization. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, security risks, or data leaks. It is well-structured, using standard patterns, with no hidden or suspicious activities.",
