{
  "purpose": "Provides utilities for pytest test step management, including data sharing, dependency handling, parameterization, and manual execution control.",
  "sources": "Imports standard Python modules, pytest, and local modules; reads function signatures, request objects, and module attributes.",
  "sinks": "Dynamically sets attributes on modules and functions, modifies function signatures, and creates fixtures; no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Uses decorator wrapping, signature modification, fixture injection, and attribute setting to control test execution flow and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic attribute setting and fixture creation could be misused if external inputs influence decorator parameters or module context, but this is typical in pytest extensions.",
  "analysis": "The code manages test steps, dependencies, and shared data through standard pytest mechanisms, with dynamic features like attribute injection and fixture creation. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The dynamic attribute modifications are common in pytest plugins but could pose risks if external inputs are untrusted. Overall, the code is well-structured, with appropriate version compatibility and safeguards. The potential security concern is minimal and typical for test framework extensions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate pytest utility module for structured test management, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The dynamic features are standard and pose minimal security risk in controlled environments. The assigned scores (malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk approximately 0.15-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
