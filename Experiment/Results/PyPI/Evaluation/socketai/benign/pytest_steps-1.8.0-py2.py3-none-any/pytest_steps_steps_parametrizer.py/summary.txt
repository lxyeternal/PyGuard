  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate pytest utility module for structured test management, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The dynamic features are standard and pose minimal security risk in controlled environments. The assigned scores (malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk approximately 0.15-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."
