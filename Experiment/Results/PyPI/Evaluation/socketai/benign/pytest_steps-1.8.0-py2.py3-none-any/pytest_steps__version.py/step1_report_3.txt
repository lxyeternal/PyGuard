  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output; no sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no suspicious code, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials.",
  "analysis": "The code solely assigns static version information for a package using hardcoded strings and tuples. It contains no dynamic execution, user input handling, or network activity. The comments indicate the code is auto-generated by setuptools_scm and should not be altered. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serves to specify package version info, and does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
