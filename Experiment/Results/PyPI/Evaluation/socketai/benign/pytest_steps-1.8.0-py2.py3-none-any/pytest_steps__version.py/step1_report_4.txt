  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, used for version management.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only sets variables within the script.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data handling in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; it only assigns static version values.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and auto-generated, with comments indicating it should not be altered or tracked.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments and comments. It is generated by setuptools_scm, a standard version management tool for Python projects. There are no dynamic or suspicious operations, no input handling, and no data leaks or malicious behavior. The comments explicitly instruct not to change or track the file in version control, which aligns with standard auto-generated code practices.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a benign, auto-generated version file for a Python package. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no security risks.",
