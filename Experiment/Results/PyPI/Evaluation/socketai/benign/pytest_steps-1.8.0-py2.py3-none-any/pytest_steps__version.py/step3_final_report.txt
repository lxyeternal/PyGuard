  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static assignment of version variables with comments indicating auto-generation. It contains no dynamic behavior, input handling, external communication, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify the benign, static nature of the code, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated version declaration with no malicious or suspicious elements. The assessments and scores across all reports are accurate and justified. No further action or adjustment is necessary.",
