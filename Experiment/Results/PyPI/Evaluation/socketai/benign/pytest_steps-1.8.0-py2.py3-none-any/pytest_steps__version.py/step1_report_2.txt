  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or user input handling.",
  "flows": "N/A — static data assignment, no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Comment suggests automatic code generation; no suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and only assigns version information as static strings and tuples. It contains no input handling, data processing, or external communication. The comments indicate it is auto-generated by setuptools_scm, which is common for version management. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. It appears to be a benign version declaration used in packaging.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a harmless, auto-generated version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks.",
