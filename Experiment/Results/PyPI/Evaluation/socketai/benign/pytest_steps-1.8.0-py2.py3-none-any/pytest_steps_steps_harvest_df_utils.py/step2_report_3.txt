  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's behavior, potential security concerns, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is utility functions for processing pytest result DataFrames, with no malicious activity detected. The confidence is high (0.9), and malware/security risk scores are low (0.1 and 0.1).\n\n- **Analysis:** The reviewer correctly notes that the code manipulates pandas DataFrames for test result analysis, with proper validation and no suspicious patterns. The optional import of `pytest_harvest` is standard practice for optional dependencies.\n\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior. The scores seem appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The assigned malware score (0) and security risk (0.1) are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, the code is standard pandas data processing functions related to pytest results, with no malicious activity. The confidence is very high (0.95), malware score is 0, and security risk is 0.2.\n\n- **Analysis:** The reviewer emphasizes the absence of suspicious code, obfuscated patterns, or external malicious activity. The reliance on external libraries is standard, and no malicious behavior is indicated.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The low malware and security risk scores are justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code handles pytest result DataFrames, with no signs of malicious activity. Confidence is high (0.95), malware score is 0, security risk is 0.2.\n\n- **Analysis:** The reviewer notes the use of standard pandas operations, proper error handling, and optional dependencies guarded by try-except. No malicious intent or suspicious patterns are detected.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The assigned scores are justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is for pandas DataFrame manipulation in pytest contexts, with no malicious activity. Confidence is 0.9, malware score 0, security risk 0.1.\n\n- **Analysis:** The reviewer correctly points out the standard nature of the code, the guarded optional import, and the lack of suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code performs pandas DataFrame operations with no malicious activity. Confidence is very high (0.95), malware score 0, security risk 0.\n\n- **Analysis:** The reviewer notes that the code uses standard pandas operations, with guarded imports, and no signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The low malware and security risk scores are justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis—no malicious activity, code injection, or suspicious behavior detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is straightforward, well-structured, and not obfuscated.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), but all are very low, reflecting minimal security concern, mainly due to reliance on optional dependencies and standard data processing.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, well-structured code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, standard data processing context)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a legitimate utility module for pytest result processing. The scores assigned in all reports are consistent with the code's behavior and the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My personal estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
