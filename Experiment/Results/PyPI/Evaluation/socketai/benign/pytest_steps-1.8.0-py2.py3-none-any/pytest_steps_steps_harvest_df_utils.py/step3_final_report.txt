  "purpose": "Utility functions for processing pytest result DataFrames, including pivoting, flattening columns, and handling step information within pandas DataFrames.",
  "sources": "DataFrames containing pytest results, optional dependencies like pytest_harvest, and internal functions for parameter extraction.",
  "sinks": "Internal pandas DataFrame manipulations; no external data sinks, network activity, or untrusted data outputs.",
  "flows": "Data is read from DataFrames and session objects, processed via pandas operations, and sometimes external plugin functions, with no external data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic. Optional imports are guarded with try-except, standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard pandas DataFrame manipulations for pytest result analysis, with proper validation and error handling. No malicious or obfuscated patterns are present. Optional dependencies are guarded, and the functions are well-structured and documented.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate utility code for pytest result processing, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The low scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
