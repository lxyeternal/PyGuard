{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for manipulating and analyzing pandas DataFrames, particularly in the context of pytest test results and fixtures. It includes functions for pivoting data, flattening multi-level columns, and handling step identifiers in test result dataframes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from pandas DataFrames (`results_df`) and some function parameters such as `pytest_session`, `cross_steps_columns`, `step_param_names`, and others. It also imports from internal modules and external libraries (`pandas`, `pytest_harvest`).",
  "sinks": "Potential untrusted data could come from external DataFrame inputs or parameters, but these are internal to the functions. No direct sinks such as network I/O, file I/O, or system commands are present. The code manipulates data but does not execute untrusted code or write sensitive information.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input DataFrames into functions, which then process or transform them through pivoting, flattening, or restructuring. No untrusted external data sources or sinks, nor code execution based on untrusted input, are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code contains standard pandas DataFrame manipulations, with appropriate error handling and input validation. There are no signs of obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is well-structured utility functions for pandas DataFrame processing, primarily for organizing pytest results. It validates parameters, handles edge cases, and performs data transformations safely. There are no indications of malicious intent or malicious code patterns. External dependencies are optional or version-specific, but used appropriately. The functions operate purely on data manipulation without any network access, file I/O, or code execution based on external inputs. Overall, the code appears legitimate and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of internal data processing functions for pytest result analysis with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a standard implementation of data manipulation utilities with proper validation and no suspicious patterns.",
