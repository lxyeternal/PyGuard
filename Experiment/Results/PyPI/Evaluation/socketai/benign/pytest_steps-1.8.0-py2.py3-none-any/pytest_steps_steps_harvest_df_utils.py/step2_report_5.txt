  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to determine if the issues are present, evaluate the reasoning, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes utility functions for pandas DataFrame transformations related to pytest results. No external or untrusted data sources are indicated.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, code injection, or malicious behavior. The code uses standard pandas operations, and optional dependencies are guarded.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious intent or security risks.\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a legitimate utility module with no malicious behavior. The malware score of 0 and security risk of 0.1 seem appropriate, given the optional import guard, which is standard practice.\n\n**Score adjustment:** The security risk could be slightly higher (e.g., 0.2) due to the optional dependency import, but it's minimal. Overall, scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on pandas DataFrame manipulations for pytest results.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No anomalies or malicious patterns detected. Usage of pandas and external modules is standard.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior; low security risk.\n\n**Assessment:** The malware score of 0 and security risk of 0 are justified. The high confidence (0.95) aligns with the straightforward analysis.\n\n**Score adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, utility functions for pytest DataFrame processing, including fixture name extraction.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no obfuscated patterns. The function `get_all_cross_steps_fixture_names` relies on `pytest_harvest`, but with proper error handling.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity; low security risk.\n\n**Assessment:** The scores are appropriate. The reliance on optional third-party plugin is standard, and no malicious behavior is indicated.\n\n**Score adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Data processing functions for pytest results, including pivoting and flattening columns.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns. Dependency on `pytest_harvest` is optional and guarded.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate data processing code, no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Assessment:** The malware and security risk scores are justified as zero or very low.\n\n**Score adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for pandas DataFrames, with external module imports.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Potential concern about importing third-party modules like `pytest_harvest`, but the import is guarded with try-except, which is standard.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected; code appears safe.\n\n**Assessment:** The malware score is 0, and security risk is 0, which are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, as the code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk scores:** Generally low, reflecting the absence of malicious activity but acknowledging optional dependencies.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the reports' reasoning.\n- Given the thorough analysis, I agree with the current scores.\n- No modifications needed.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports (no malicious code detected).\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear).\n- **Risk:** Slightly higher than 0.1 in some cases due to optional dependencies, but overall very low.\n\n**Final estimate:**  \n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.2 (to account for optional dependencies and external module reliance, but still minimal)\n\nThis reflects a low-security concern with no malicious intent.",
