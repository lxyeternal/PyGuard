{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for processing and transforming pandas DataFrames related to pytest results, particularly focusing on step handling, pivoting, and fixture analysis in pytest sessions.",
  "sources": "Reads input DataFrames (results_df), pandas DataFrame columns, session objects (pytest_session), and fixture names.",
  "sinks": "Modifies DataFrame contents, including renaming columns, resetting indices, and setting multi-level indices; calls external functions like get_all_pytest_param_names_except_step_id and get_all_pytest_fixture_names.",
  "flows": "Input DataFrame and session data flow into functions which modify or analyze DataFrames, including extraction of column names, pivoting, flattening columns, and handling step IDs; fixture names are retrieved from pytest session objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors observed. The code relies on standard pandas operations, external functions, and pytest session attributes. No obfuscated code or malicious network activity detected. Import statements are standard, and error handling appears appropriate.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical DataFrame manipulations for test result analysis, including pivoting, flattening multi-level columns, and managing step IDs within pandas DataFrames. It imports standard modules and pytest_harvest only when necessary, with proper error handling. The functions check for input validity, handle missing data, and modify DataFrames in expected ways. No indications of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoor behavior, are present. Usage of external libraries like pandas and pytest_harvest is standard and does not suggest malicious intent. No obfuscated or suspicious patterns were detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility functions for pytest result analysis, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It utilizes typical pandas operations and external pytest-related libraries responsibly. The overall security risk is low.",
