  "purpose": "Utility functions for pytest result data management, including test ID manipulation and parameter extraction.",
  "sources": "In-memory data structures, external modules like 'pytest_harvest' (optional), test result dictionaries, and test IDs.",
  "sinks": "In-memory data modifications; no external system calls, network activity, or file operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows involve copying dictionaries, extracting parameters, removing step IDs, and constructing new test IDs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Use of optional imports and commented code are benign.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data processing routines: copying dictionaries, validating parameters, extracting step IDs, and modifying test IDs. It relies on external dependencies responsibly and includes proper error handling. No network, file, or system modifications are present. The functions are straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for pytest result handling, with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0 and low risk score are appropriate.",
