  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Summary:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for pytest result data, manipulating test IDs and parameters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external system calls; data flows are in-memory.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns; standard utility code. Uses optional imports and external dependencies responsibly.\n- **Conclusion:** No evidence of malicious activity; very low security risk.\n\n**Score Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (very low).\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Summary:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar utility functions, focusing on test result dictionaries and pytest session data.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external system interaction; data processing is internal.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code; relies on external 'pytest_harvest' which is optional and handled properly.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; security risk is minimal.\n\n**Score Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Summary:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same core functions for test result management, handling step IDs.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external system interaction; data remains in-memory.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Routine data handling, no obfuscation or malicious patterns. Commented-out code is benign.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent detected; low security risk.\n\n**Score Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Summary:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for pytest result dictionaries, focusing on IDs and parameters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No network or file operations; data processing only.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Standard utility code, no suspicious patterns. Uses external dependencies responsibly.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity; very low security risk.\n\n**Score Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Summary:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous, manipulating test IDs and parameters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external system calls; data is processed internally.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Routine, safe code. No obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** No indicators of malicious activity; security risk is negligible.\n\n**Score Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (still very low).\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity. The code is standard utility functions for test data management.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation is present; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** The highest reported is 0.2, which is very low. Given the nature of the code—mainly in-memory data processing, ID manipulation, and parameter filtering—there's no reason to assign a higher risk.\n\n### **My Final Estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No signs of malicious payloads or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, readable code with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — Very low, given the code's utility purpose and lack of external system interaction.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a set of utility functions for pytest test result handling, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this assessment.",
