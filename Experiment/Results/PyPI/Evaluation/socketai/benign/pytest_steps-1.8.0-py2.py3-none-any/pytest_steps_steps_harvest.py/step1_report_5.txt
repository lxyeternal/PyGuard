{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for handling pytest results dictionaries, especially for manipulating test IDs and extracting parameter names, with a focus on removing step-specific information.",
  "sources": "Data is read from input dictionaries (`results_dct`), function parameters, and session objects. Parameters are accessed via dictionary keys, and test IDs are processed through string manipulation functions.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data from input dictionaries, session objects, or parameters could influence the generated test IDs or result dictionaries, but no insecure data leakage or unsafe operations are directly present.",
  "flows": "Input data (results_dct, session, parameters) is processed to generate new test IDs and modified dictionaries, with key steps including parameter extraction, ID modification via `remove_param_from_pytest_node_str_id`, and conditional error handling based on missing data or policy settings.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded secrets or credentials are present. The code relies on external functions (`remove_param_from_pytest_node_str_id`, `_get_step_param_names_or_default`) which are imported. The functions are primarily data handling and manipulation utilities. No obfuscated or intentionally malicious code patterns are evident. The presence of commented-out code is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code performs parameter extraction, dictionary copying, and test ID modification. It checks for presence and uniqueness of step parameters, raises errors on missing or conflicting data, and conditionally returns copies or modified results based on policies. No network access, system commands, or file operations are present. The functions assume the correctness of imported utility functions. There are no indications of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The overall structure is typical of test utility code, with safety-focused error handling and input validation. No obfuscated patterns or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of utility functions designed for test result manipulation within pytest environments. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. Its purpose is limited to data processing and ID management for test cases. No indicators of malware or supply chain attacks are present.",
