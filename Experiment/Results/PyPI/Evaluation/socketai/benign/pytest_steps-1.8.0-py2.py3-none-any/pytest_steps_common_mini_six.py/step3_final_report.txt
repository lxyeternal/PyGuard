  "purpose": "Compatibility functions for Python 2 and 3, including re-raising exceptions and executing code strings in a version-dependent manner.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info for version detection; static code strings within exec_ functions; exception handling constructs.",
  "sinks": "exec_ executes code strings, which could be a sink if external input is passed, but in this code, the strings are static and controlled.",
  "flows": "Version detection sources lead to different implementations of reraise and exec_; static code in exec_ executes without external influence.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() with static code is standard for compatibility; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides compatibility utilities for exception re-raising and code execution across Python versions. The exec_ function executes static code snippets, which is safe within this context. The reraise functions are standard exception handling utilities. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The primary concern is the potential misuse of exec_ if external untrusted input is passed, but as provided, the code is safe. Malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting the controlled use of exec().",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard compatibility boilerplate with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The use of exec() is safe here due to static code strings, but caution is advised if the functions are used elsewhere with untrusted input. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk.",
