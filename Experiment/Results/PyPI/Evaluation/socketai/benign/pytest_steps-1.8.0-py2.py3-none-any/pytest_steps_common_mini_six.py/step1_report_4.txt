{
  "purpose": "The code provides compatibility functions for Python 2 and 3, including a re-raise function and a commented-out metaclass utility.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, sys._getframe, exec statements, imported sys module",
  "sinks": "exec statements executing dynamic code, re-raise function calling exception handling",
  "flows": "sys._getframe -> exec in Python 2 branch, exec string -> reraise function in Python 3 branch",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec with dynamically constructed code; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; no obfuscated or malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code uses sys.version_info to determine Python version and define compatibility functions. The reraise function is implemented differently for Python 2 and 3, with the Python 2 version using exec to define reraise dynamically. The exec statements are standard for compatibility code and do not involve user input. There are no indications of malicious code such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The commented-out code is benign and unrelated to malicious activities. No suspicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is standard compatibility code designed to handle differences between Python 2 and 3. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
