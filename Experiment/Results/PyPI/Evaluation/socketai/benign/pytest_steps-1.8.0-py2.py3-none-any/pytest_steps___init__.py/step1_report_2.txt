{
  "purpose": "This code defines and exports components for a testing framework, including version management, submodule imports, and conditional imports based on optional dependencies.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (_version, setuptools_scm, os, pytest_harvest), and optional import of pytest_harvest at runtime.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data processing or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code mainly sets up module imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. Conditional import based on optional dependencies is normal for Python packages.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages module imports, versioning, and exports for a testing framework. It uses try-except blocks to handle optional dependencies gracefully. There are no signs of malicious logic, such as network activity, data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The only dynamic behavior is the conditional import of 'pytest_harvest' and related modules if available, which is typical for optional package features. The code appears clean, structured, and adheres to common open-source practices without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup for a testing framework with optional dependencies and version management. It shows no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
