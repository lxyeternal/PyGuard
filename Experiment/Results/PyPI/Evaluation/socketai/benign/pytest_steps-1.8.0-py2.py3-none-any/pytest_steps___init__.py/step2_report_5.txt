  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing the described logic and potential risks with the actual code.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code performs standard module imports, version handling, and conditional optional dependencies.\n- It uses try-except blocks to handle missing modules gracefully.\n- No untrusted input processing, network calls, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The only dynamic behavior involves fetching version info and optional imports, which are common practices.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Correctly identifies that the code manages version info, imports, and optional dependencies.\n- No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0 (correct)\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the absence of suspicious patterns and malicious behavior.\n- Correctly notes that conditional imports are standard.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Reiterates the straightforward nature of the code.\n- No signs of malicious activity or security issues.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n**Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Highlights the standard handling of version info and optional dependencies.\n- No suspicious activity detected.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Recognizes the code as a typical package initialization pattern.\n- No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\n\nAll reports are consistent with the code's actual content. They correctly identify that the code is a standard, benign module setup with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, risk) are all zero, which aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **My final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a typical, well-structured Python package initialization script, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nBased on the detailed review, I agree with the reports' conclusions. The code is safe, with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and the risk is negligible.",
