{
  "purpose": "This code initializes a Python package, managing imports, version retrieval, and optional dependencies for testing and harvesting utilities.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules, version info from _version.py or setuptools_scm, optional import from pytest_harvest",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, external network calls, or system modifications",
  "flows": "Import statements and conditional dependencies do not process untrusted data or lead to external effects",
  "anomalies": "None; standard package setup with conditional imports and version management",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package initialization tasks: importing modules, handling version info via try-except, and managing optional dependencies with try-except-else. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks are present. The conditional import of pytest_harvest and subsequent import of harvest-related modules are benign and typical for optional dependencies. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are detected. The overall structure is straightforward and aligns with common open-source Python package practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured package initializer with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and overall security risk are appropriately set to 0, reflecting its safe and standard nature.",
