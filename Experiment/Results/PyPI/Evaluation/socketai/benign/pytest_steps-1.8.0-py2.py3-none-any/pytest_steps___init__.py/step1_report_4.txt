{
  "purpose": "This code module provides imports, version handling, and exports for a pytest-related package, organizing submodules and conditional imports.",
  "sources": [
    "Import statements for internal modules (.steps, .steps_generator, etc.)",
    "Conditional import of version info from _version.py or setuptools_scm",
    "Optional import of pytest_harvest from external package"
  ],
  "sinks": [
    "Import of potentially untrusted external modules (setuptools_scm, pytest_harvest)",
    "Assignment to __version__ based on external version sources"
  ],
  "flows": [
    "Import statements -> internal module references",
    "Conditional logic -> external package imports",
    "Version assignment -> __version__ variable"
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "No hardcoded credentials or secrets",
    "No dynamic code execution or obfuscation",
    "Conditional imports based on external packages, which is standard practice",
    "Use of __all__ to expose symbols is typical and not suspicious"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages module imports, version retrieval, and conditional inclusion of additional functionalities depending on the environment (presence of pytest_harvest). It employs standard Python idioms for optional dependencies and version management, with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior. The logic is straightforward, with no data leaks, code injections, or backdoors. No external data is handled insecurely; the external imports are optional and controlled.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, functioning as a module organizer and version handler with conditional dependencies. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
