{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define and manage module exports, imports, and versioning for a Python testing-related package, primarily involving submodules and conditional imports based on optional dependencies.",
  "sources": "Imports from local submodules (.steps, .steps_generator, .steps_parametrizer, etc.), conditional import from setuptools_scm and os.path, and optional import from pytest_harvest.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leak or system effect. No use of eval, exec, or insecure system calls.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing modules and conditionally importing additional components if optional dependencies are present. No untrusted input flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. The use of try-except for optional dependencies is standard. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes the module's __version__ via version control tools or setuptools_scm, manages __all__ exports, and conditionally imports additional modules if pytest_harvest is installed. It avoids executing untrusted code or handling sensitive data. No obfuscation or suspicious logic is present. The only dynamic behavior is version fetching and optional module import, which are common in Python packaging.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package __init__.py pattern, responsible for organizing exports and handling optional dependencies. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks in this code.",
