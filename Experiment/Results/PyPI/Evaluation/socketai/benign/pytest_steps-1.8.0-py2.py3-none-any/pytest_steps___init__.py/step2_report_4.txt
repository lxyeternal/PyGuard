  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing the described logic with the actual code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Summary:** Standard module setup, version handling, optional dependencies, no suspicious activity.  \n- **Assessment:** The code only manages imports, version info, and conditional dependencies. No data processing, network activity, or code execution from untrusted sources.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Verdict:** The report's conclusion aligns well with the code. No issues detected.  \n- **Recommendation:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing safe import patterns, version management, and optional dependencies.  \n- **Assessment:** No suspicious patterns, no external communication, no data leaks.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Verdict:** Correct and consistent with the code.  \n- **Recommendation:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Summary:** Focuses on import organization, version handling, and optional dependencies, with no malicious behavior.  \n- **Assessment:** No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data processing from untrusted sources.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Verdict:** The analysis is accurate.  \n- **Recommendation:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Summary:** Emphasizes benign import management, versioning, and optional dependencies.  \n- **Assessment:** No suspicious activity or security risks.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Verdict:** Fully aligned with the code.  \n- **Recommendation:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Summary:** Recognizes the code as a typical package initialization with no malicious intent.  \n- **Assessment:** No evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Verdict:** Correct and consistent.  \n- **Recommendation:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code Behavior:** All reports correctly identify that this module only manages imports, versioning, and conditional dependencies.  \n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious code.  \n- **Security Risks:** No vulnerabilities or risky patterns are present.  \n- **Score Justification:** All scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk are justified.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent with the code's actual behavior. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign module setup for a Python testing framework. It handles versioning and optional dependencies gracefully, with no malicious or risky behavior detected. The provided scores and conclusions are appropriate.",
