  "purpose": "A pytest extension for managing generator-based test steps, optional steps, and fixture proxies to facilitate complex test workflows.",
  "sources": "Internal parameters, pytest environment, fixture proxies, exception classes, and control flow within pytest test execution.",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission; exception handling and internal state management.",
  "flows": "Control flow within pytest, involving generator execution, exception handling, and fixture proxies.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; uses standard testing patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard patterns for pytest extensions, including context managers, proxies, dynamic signature modifications, and exception classes. It manages test steps, optional steps, and fixture proxies in a structured manner. No external network or data leaks are present. The use of dynamic signatures and proxies is typical for flexible testing utilities, not malicious code. The exception handling and generator control are within expected patterns for such frameworks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured pytest utility designed for complex test orchestration. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
