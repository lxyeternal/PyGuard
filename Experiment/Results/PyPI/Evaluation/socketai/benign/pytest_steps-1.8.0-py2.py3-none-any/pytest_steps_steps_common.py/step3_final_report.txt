  "purpose": "Utility functions for pytest test node identification, parameter handling, and hashing to generate consistent test IDs and hashes.",
  "sources": "pytest node attributes such as nodeid, callspec.params, and request.funcargnames; internal string manipulations.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data transfer or system modification occurs.",
  "flows": "Extraction of test parameters and IDs from pytest node/request, manipulation of ID strings, and hashing of parameter values.",
  "anomalies": "Use of string replacement functions on test IDs, which could be misused if IDs are externally controlled, but in typical pytest usage, IDs are internally generated and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions for managing pytest test IDs, parameters, and hashing. It manipulates internal pytest data structures and strings to generate IDs and hashes for test cases. No network, file I/O, or external data leaks are present. Commented-out code indicates incomplete features but no malicious intent. The functions operate solely on internal data, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external communication. The minor use of string replacements on IDs could pose a theoretical risk if IDs are externally manipulated, but in standard pytest environments, this is safe. The code is straightforward, well-commented, and serves a legitimate purpose in test management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for pytest test identification and parameter hashing. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks are detected. The small security concern regarding string manipulation is minimal and acceptable given the context. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting cautious acknowledgment of potential misuse but overall low risk.",
