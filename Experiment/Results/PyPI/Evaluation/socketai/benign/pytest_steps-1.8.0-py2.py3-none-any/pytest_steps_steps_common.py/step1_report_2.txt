{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for managing pytest node identifiers, parameter extraction, and hash generation to facilitate test identification and parametrization handling in pytest.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function arguments, pytest node objects, request objects, and string identifiers for pytest nodes.",
  "sinks": "The code does not appear to write or send untrusted data to external systems or perform any sensitive data leak operations.",
  "flows": "Input data from pytest node objects and requests are processed through functions to generate identifiers or extract parameter data; these are internal data manipulations without external communication.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains commented-out sections and placeholder functions related to pytest node id parsing, but these are inactive. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code structures. The functions rely solely on pytest internals and string manipulations. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The script defines utility functions for extracting, manipulating, and hashing pytest test identifiers and parameters. All operations involve safe string handling, hashing, and attribute access on pytest objects. No external network calls, system modifications, or sensitive data access are evident. Commented code and placeholder functions do not introduce malicious behavior. The code appears to serve testing infrastructure purposes with no suspicious or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of pytest utility functions focused on test identification and parameter management. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is safe and aligns with legitimate testing infrastructure functions.",
