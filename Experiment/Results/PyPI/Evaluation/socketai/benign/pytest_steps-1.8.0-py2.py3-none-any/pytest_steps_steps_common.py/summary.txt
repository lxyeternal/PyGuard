  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for pytest test identification and parameter hashing. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks are detected. The small security concern regarding string manipulation is minimal and acceptable given the context. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting cautious acknowledgment of potential misuse but overall low risk."
