  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. It is a straightforward utility for test data handling, and the scores should reflect minimal threat. Malware score remains at 0, obfuscated at 0, and risk at approximately 0.1 due to optional dependencies, which is justified."
