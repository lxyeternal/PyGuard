  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its intent, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines pytest fixtures for handling test result DataFrames, pivoting, and sharing results, with no external data leaks or malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is primarily data manipulation within a testing framework. No suspicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n- **Justification:** The low risk score is appropriate; the code is standard test data handling. No malware detected, and no obfuscation. The minor risk accounts for optional dependencies, but overall, the assessment is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the data processing nature, no external communication, and safe practices.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's purpose. The functions used are not provided, but their use for data handling suggests benign intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The risk score is appropriately zero.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on handling and pivoting test result DataFrames, with no external data transmission or suspicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports; the code appears benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n- **Justification:** Slightly above zero risk, but justified given the optional import handling, which is common and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, emphasizing the data processing nature, no external data leaks, or malicious code.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; the code is standard test utility code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or obfuscation, risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is for test result data handling, with no external data leaks or malicious intent.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous findings; no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0\n- **Justification:** No malware or obfuscation; the low risk score is suitable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is for test result data handling within pytest fixtures. The functions used (`handle_steps_in_results_df`, `pivot_steps_on_df`) are standard data processing functions, and their implementations are not provided but are assumed to be safe.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation are present.\n- **Risk Scores:** The scores are appropriately low, reflecting the benign nature of the code. Slightly above zero risk scores account for optional dependencies and import handling, which is standard practice.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at **0** for all reports, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at **0**, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code, a risk score of **0.1** is acceptable, mainly due to optional imports and standard data handling.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThe reports are accurate and conservative in their assessment. No further action needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, straightforward test utility code with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.",
