  "purpose": "Defines pytest fixtures for handling test result DataFrames, pivoting, and sharing results across test steps, with optional imports from pytest-harvest.",
  "sources": "Imports from pytest, optional imports from pytest_harvest, functions handle_steps_in_results_df and pivot_steps_on_df, data passed via fixtures",
  "sinks": "Local data processing within pytest fixtures; no external data transmission or network activity",
  "flows": "Fixtures receive dataframes, process via handle_steps_in_results_df and pivot_steps_on_df, return processed dataframes or result bags",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns; standard optional import handling",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup for pytest fixtures managing test result dataframes, with optional dependencies. It performs data transformations without external communication or malicious logic. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present. The functions used are external and assumed safe. The code's purpose is benign, aimed at test data management within pytest.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. It is a straightforward utility for test data handling, and the scores should reflect minimal threat. Malware score remains at 0, obfuscated at 0, and risk at approximately 0.1 due to optional dependencies, which is justified.",
