{
  "purpose": "This code defines pytest fixtures for handling and transforming test result data, especially with pytest-harvest integration, to facilitate data pivoting and result aggregation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from fixture parameters such as 'session_results_df', 'module_results_df', and 'results_bag'. It also attempts to import functions from 'pytest_steps' and 'pytest_harvest'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; no data is written to external systems, files, or network connections.",
  "flows": "Input fixtures are processed through functions like 'handle_steps_in_results_df', 'pivot_steps_on_df', and returned as fixture outputs. No external or untrusted data flows to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or malicious logic are present. The code includes standard pytest fixture definitions and conditional imports with safe fallback.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard testing libraries and optional modules. It defines fixtures that process test result data, with some conditional handling if 'pytest_harvest' is unavailable. The functions perform data transformations related to test step results. No external network operations, code injections, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The use of 'try-except' for imports is normal for optional dependencies. The fixtures do not contain any executable code that manipulates system resources maliciously or collects sensitive data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of pytest fixtures for data handling and transformation, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as part of a testing framework extension and does not perform any harmful operations.",
