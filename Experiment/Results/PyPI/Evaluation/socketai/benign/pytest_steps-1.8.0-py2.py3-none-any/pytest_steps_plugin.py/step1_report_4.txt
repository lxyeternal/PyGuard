{
  "purpose": "The code defines pytest fixtures for handling and transforming test result data, including pivoting dataframes and sharing result bags across steps.",
  "sources": "Imports from pytest, pytest_steps, and optionally pytest-harvest; fixture parameters such as session_results_df, module_results_df, and results_bag.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed; no network, file, or external data transmission present.",
  "flows": "Input data (fixtures) is processed via handle_steps_in_results_df and pivot_steps_on_df functions, then passed through fixtures for sharing results; no external or untrusted data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Use of try-except to handle optional imports is standard; no obfuscation or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines test fixtures that process DataFrames representing test results and share data among test steps. Functions like handle_steps_in_results_df and pivot_steps_on_df are used, but their implementations are not provided, limiting detailed static analysis. No network activity, credential handling, or system modifications are present. The optional import handling is standard for optional dependencies. Overall, the code appears to be straightforward test utility code without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of pytest fixtures for processing test results and sharing data across test steps. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected. It appears to be standard test support code with no harmful intent.",
