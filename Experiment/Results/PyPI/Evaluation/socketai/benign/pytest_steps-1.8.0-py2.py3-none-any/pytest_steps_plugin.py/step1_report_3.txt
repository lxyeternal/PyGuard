{
  "purpose": "Defines pytest fixtures related to handling and pivoting session and module result dataframes, and provides result bags for steps in pytest-based testing.",
  "sources": "Imports external modules (pytest, pytest_steps), and conditionally imports functions from pytest_steps.",
  "sinks": "None identified. No data is sent over network, written to files, or processed insecurely.",
  "flows": "Data flows from imported fixtures and functions into fixture definitions, with no untrusted external input handling or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code includes conditional imports and defines fixtures cleanly.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard pytest fixture setup with conditional import handling. It manipulates dataframes related to test results, providing pivoted views and result bags. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The functions seem to serve testing and data handling purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, focusing on test data manipulation via fixtures with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
