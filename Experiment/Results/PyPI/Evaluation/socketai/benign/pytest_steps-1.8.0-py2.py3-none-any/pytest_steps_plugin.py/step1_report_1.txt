{
  "purpose": "This code defines pytest fixtures for handling test result dataframes, pivoting data, and sharing results across test steps in a pytest testing environment, primarily to facilitate test result analysis and reporting.",
  "sources": "Imports from pytest, pytest_steps, and optionally pytest-harvest; dataframes passed as parameters to fixtures; environment variables are not used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; dataframes are processed locally, and no untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "flows": "Input dataframes are processed through functions like handle_steps_in_results_df and pivot_steps_on_df within fixtures, with no external data transmission or execution of untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "The code relies on optional imports and standard pytest fixture patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are evident. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing libraries, defines fixtures for data processing, and uses optional imports for enhanced functionality. The fixtures manipulate dataframes related to test results, pivoting and handling steps, which is typical for test data management. There are no indications of malicious code, such as network communication, secret handling, or backdoors. The logic appears to be straightforward and intended for test data analysis. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are present. The optional import handling is safe and common in Python projects. Overall, the code performs data processing within a testing framework without external data leaks or malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard pytest fixture setup for test result data manipulation. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The code is well-structured for its purpose and exhibits no signs of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
