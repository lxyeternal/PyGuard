{
  "purpose": "This code defines pytest fixtures for handling and transforming test result dataframes, and for managing result bags in pytest tests, likely for reporting or analysis purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports from pytest, pytest_steps, and optionally pytest-harvest; uses request.session and session_results_df, module_results_df, results_bag data.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes data to external sources, network, or files; no untrusted data is sent or used in sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Fixtures process input dataframes and result bags, applying functions handle_steps_in_results_df, pivot_steps_on_df, and returning modified data structures; no data flows into external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except to handle optional import of pytest-harvest is normal; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines pytest fixtures for handling test result data. It conditionally imports optional modules, which is standard practice. Functions like handle_steps_in_results_df and pivot_steps_on_df are used for data manipulation but are not provided here, so their security impact cannot be assessed in detail. There are no input sources that accept untrusted external data, no data leaks, or network activity. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are present. The code appears clean and intended solely for test result processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of pytest fixtures for result data management, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It does not perform any external communication or sensitive data handling. Overall, it appears safe.",
