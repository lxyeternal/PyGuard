{
  "purpose": "This code provides decorators and utility functions to facilitate parameterized test steps in pytest, including handling fixtures across multiple test steps and dynamically choosing decorators based on function type or mode.",
  "sources": "The code reads function parameters, decorator arguments, and module imports. It accesses pytest request objects within fixtures.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data are present. There are no code execution, network, or data leakage operations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters from decorators or pytest requests are processed but do not flow into potentially dangerous sinks such as network, file, or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution beyond standard decorator wrapping. The code is structured normally for pytest plugin development.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily implements pytest decorators for parameterizing test steps and managing fixture scope. It uses standard Python features such as reflection (`inspect`), decorators (`wraps`), and conditionally imports modules for compatibility. No malicious or suspicious logic, such as network access, file manipulation, or code injection, is present. The code's purpose aligns with pytest plugin behavior, and all functions are typical for test scaffolding. The dynamic handling of generator functions and fixtures is standard practice. There are no signs of malicious intent, data exfiltration, or sabotage. The code appears to be a benign pytest utility for managing test steps and fixtures.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard pytest plugin utility for managing test steps and fixtures. It contains no malicious behavior, no obfuscated code, and poses no security risks. It is safe for use and appears to be well-structured for its intended purpose.",
