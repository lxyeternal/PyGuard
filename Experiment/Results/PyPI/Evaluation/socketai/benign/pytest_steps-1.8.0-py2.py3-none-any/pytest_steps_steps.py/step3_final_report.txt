{
  "purpose": "Provides pytest decorators and fixtures for test step parametrization, generator support, and fixture sharing across steps.",
  "sources": "Function signatures, decorator wrappers, fixture request objects, and signature modifications.",
  "sinks": "No external data flows or untrusted inputs leading to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Decorator application and fixture caching based on request scope, signature wrapping, and fixture instance reuse.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic signature modification and fixture caching, which are standard in pytest extensions but could be misused if altered maliciously.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard pytest extension patterns: decorators for parametrization, dynamic signature adjustments with makefun, fixture caching based on request scope, and support for generator fixtures. No network activity, code injection, or external data leaks are present. The fixture caching mechanism is typical for sharing fixtures across steps, and signature modifications are controlled and limited. No obfuscation or malicious code patterns are detected. The code's purpose is to enhance test workflows without security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate pytest utility for managing test steps and fixtures. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores from the reports are consistent and appropriate, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) reflecting the standard practices used. Overall, the code is safe, well-structured, and intended for testing enhancements.",
