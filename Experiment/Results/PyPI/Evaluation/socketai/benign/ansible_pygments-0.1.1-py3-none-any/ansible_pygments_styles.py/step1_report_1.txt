  "purpose": "Define a custom syntax highlighting style for Pygments to be used in the Ansible ecosystem.",
  "sources": "Imports from pygments.style and pygments.token modules; class AnsibleStyle which defines style attributes and token styles.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input or data; no external data handling or network operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted data; the code solely defines style configurations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual code constructs. The style definitions are straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for defining a style, then creates a class inheriting from Style with static style attributes and token-specific styles. No external input, environment variables, or dynamic code execution are present. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are observed, and the code's purpose is solely aesthetic configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign style definition for syntax highlighting, with no indications of malicious intent, data leakage, or security risks. It is a static, straightforward configuration file.",
