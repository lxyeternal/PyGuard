  "purpose": "Define a custom syntax highlighting style for Pygments, tailored for the Ansible ecosystem.",
  "sources": "Imports from pygments.style and pygments.token modules, and the class definition containing style specifications.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted input or data; style definitions are static and do not handle external input.",
  "flows": "N/A - no dynamic data flow present; static style assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code is a straightforward style definition.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a class with style mappings for syntax highlighting. The style properties are static strings specifying colors and font styles for various token types. No input processing, data flow, or dynamic execution is present. No obfuscated code or suspicious constructs are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard static configuration for syntax highlighting, with no malicious behavior or security risks evident. It does not contain obfuscated or malicious code, nor does it perform any suspicious actions.",
