  "purpose": "Define a syntax highlighting style for Pygments tailored to the Ansible ecosystem.",
  "sources": "Import statements for Pygments style and token classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data are present; code only defines a style configuration.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; the code is static style definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines a custom Pygments style class with style attributes for various token types. It imports only styling modules and creates a class with static attribute assignments. There are no runtime data inputs, network communications, or suspicious constructs. The style configurations are conventional and serve only for syntax highlighting. No potential security issues or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard style definition for Pygments highlighting, with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a legitimate, benign configuration file.",
