  "purpose": "Static syntax highlighting style configuration for Pygments in the Ansible ecosystem.",
  "sources": "Imports from pygments.style and pygments.token; static class attributes defining style properties.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or data.",
  "flows": "N/A; static style definitions without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static style class with no dynamic or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static class inheriting from pygments.style.Style, setting style attributes and a styles dictionary for syntax highlighting. It involves no external data, network activity, or dynamic execution. The code is purely declarative, intended for styling purposes. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The style definitions are standard and do not involve any risky constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration for syntax highlighting with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and justified.",
