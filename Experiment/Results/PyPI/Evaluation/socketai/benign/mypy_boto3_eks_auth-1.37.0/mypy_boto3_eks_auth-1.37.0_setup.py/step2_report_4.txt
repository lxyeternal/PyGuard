  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the details provided, potential discrepancies, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- All reports consistently identify the code as a straightforward, static setup script for a Python package.\n- No untrusted input, dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated code is present.\n- The only unusual aspect noted is the future copyright year (2025), which is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The confidence levels are all high (1), indicating strong agreement on the benign nature of the script.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code. The code is a standard setup.py with static configuration.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- **Any logical errors or flaws?** None are evident. The code is conventional and safe.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** All assign 0, which is justified given the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n### Special Note:\n- The only point of potential concern is the future copyright year (2025). While unusual, this is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Are any scores unreasonable?** No. All scores are consistent with the code content and analysis.\n- **Should any scores be adjusted?** No, the current scores are appropriate.\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports justify a higher risk score because the code shows no malicious or vulnerable behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\nBased on the detailed analysis, I concur with the provided reports' conclusions:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, benign setup script with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate and thorough.\n- No modifications needed.\n- The code is safe, with no malware or obfuscation, and the risk is negligible.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the consensus of the reports and the code analysis.",
