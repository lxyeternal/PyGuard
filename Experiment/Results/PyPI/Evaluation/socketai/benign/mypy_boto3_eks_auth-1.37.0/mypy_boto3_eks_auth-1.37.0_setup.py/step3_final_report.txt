{
  "purpose": "This setup script is intended to package the 'mypy-boto3-eks-auth' Python library, providing metadata and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md for long description; static package metadata; imports 'setuptools' for setup process.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no dynamic code execution or network activity; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual future copyright year (2025), likely a placeholder or typo, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python library. It imports 'Path' and 'setuptools', reads a local README.md file, and calls 'setup()' with static, predefined parameters. No dynamic input, code execution, or network activity is present. The only anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not impact security. All security and malware scores are zero, consistent with the static, benign nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is a benign, standard packaging configuration with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
