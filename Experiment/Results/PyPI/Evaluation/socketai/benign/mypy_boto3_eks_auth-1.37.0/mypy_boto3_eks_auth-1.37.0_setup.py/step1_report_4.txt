  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-eks-auth package, used to configure the package installation and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description, imports setup from setuptools, and uses static package data and metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; all data used are static strings or controlled inputs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; static data remains within the script.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs identified. The script follows standard packaging conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package. It reads a local file for the long description and sets package metadata and dependencies. There are no external input reads during execution, no dynamic code execution, and no network operations or system modifications. All data used are static or well-defined variables. The code's structure and content align with common setup.py patterns, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical Python package setup file with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It solely performs package configuration tasks without any suspicious or malicious code.",
