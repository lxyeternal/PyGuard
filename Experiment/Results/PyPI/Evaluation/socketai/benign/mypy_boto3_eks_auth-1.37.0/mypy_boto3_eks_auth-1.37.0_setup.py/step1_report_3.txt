{
  "purpose": "This script sets up a Python package named 'mypy-boto3-eks-auth' with metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the filename for README.md content, package metadata inputs, and dependencies list.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is processed or used in a vulnerable manner.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is straightforward configuration for package setup, with no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The copyright date is in the future but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, reads a local README file, and calls setup() with static package metadata and dependencies. There are no dynamic or untrusted inputs, no network calls, and no execution of untrusted code. All dependencies are specified explicitly, and there are no suspicious patterns or code injections. The only unusual aspect is the copyright year set to 2025, which appears to be a future date but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Python setup configuration for packaging. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. It is a legitimate setup script for distributing a Python package.",
