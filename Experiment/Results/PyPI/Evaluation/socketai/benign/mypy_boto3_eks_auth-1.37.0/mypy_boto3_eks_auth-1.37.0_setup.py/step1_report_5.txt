{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for packaging the Python module 'mypy-boto3-eks-auth'.",
  "sources": "Reads the file 'README.md' for the long description; imports from 'setuptools'; reads package metadata and dependencies from hardcoded strings and variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data is processed or outputted to external systems.",
  "flows": "Reads local files and assigns static values; no untrusted data flows into or out of the system.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets beyond standard package metadata; no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard package setup using setuptools, reads a local README file for documentation, and specifies package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. All data is statically defined or read from a local file. There are no inputs from external sources, no dynamic execution, nor any suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a Python package and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and intended solely for packaging purposes.",
