  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the mypy-boto3-eks-auth Python package.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, static package metadata, and dependencies declarations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no data leaks or external data manipulation observed.",
  "flows": "Read README.md -> populate setup parameters -> execute setup function.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. The script is standard for Python packaging.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, reads a markdown file for long description, and calls setuptools.setup() with static, well-formed metadata. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are used dynamically. The dependencies are explicitly specified. No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or backdoors are present. Overall, it appears to be a legitimate setup configuration for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe setup script for packaging a Python library. No malicious behavior, security risks, or supply chain attacks are evident.",
