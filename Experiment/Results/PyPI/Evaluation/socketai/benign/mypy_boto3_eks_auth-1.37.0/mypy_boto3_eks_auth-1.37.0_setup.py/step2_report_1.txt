  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports uniformly conclude that the setup script is standard, static, and free of malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- They note the script reads a local README.md file, imports setuptools, and calls setup() with static parameters.\n- No untrusted data sources, dynamic code execution, or network activity are present.\n- The only unusual aspect is the future copyright year (2025), which is likely a placeholder or typo, not malicious.\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1 and malware/security risk scores of 0.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n- **Presence of static, non-malicious code only.** No dynamic code, no input processing, no obfuscated code.\n- **No security vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors detected.**\n- **No hardcoded secrets or credentials.**\n- **The code is a typical setup.py pattern.**\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:\n- The only potential point of concern is the future copyright year (2025). While unusual, it is not inherently malicious or insecure.\n- No other errors or flaws are evident.\n\n### Scores Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, since no vulnerabilities or malicious activity are identified.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n- All reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a straightforward setup script.\n- No reason to increase malware or risk scores.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- The reports do not assume or claim any vulnerabilities beyond static analysis.\n- No suspicious patterns, such as code injection, obfuscation, or external code execution, are present.\n- The future copyright year is likely a placeholder or typo, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final System-Wide Assessment:\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe setup script is safe, standard, and free of security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. No modifications to scores are necessary. The code is a benign, standard packaging script with no security risks.",
