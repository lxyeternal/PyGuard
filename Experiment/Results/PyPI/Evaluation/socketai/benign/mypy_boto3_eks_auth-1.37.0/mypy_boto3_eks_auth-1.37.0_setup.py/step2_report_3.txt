  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a standard `setup.py` script for packaging a Python library.\n- It reads a local README.md file for long description.\n- It imports `setuptools.setup` and calls it with static metadata.\n- No dynamic code execution, user input, environment variables (except for the dependency condition), or network activity.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets.\n- The only unusual aspect is the copyright year set to 2025, which appears to be a typo or placeholder, but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 in all reports. No malicious code present.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0. All code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0. All reports agree on no security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- Purpose and sources are accurate.\n- No sinks, flows, anomalies.\n- Correctly identifies the script as safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.  \n- **Confidence:** 1.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Same findings as above.\n- Correctly notes static nature and lack of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.  \n- **Confidence:** 1.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Similar assessment.\n- No suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.  \n- **Confidence:** 1.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Same conclusion.\n- No anomalies or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.  \n- **Confidence:** 1.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Same as others.\n- No issues found.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.  \n- **Confidence:** 1.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, which is correct.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports agree on 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** All reports agree on 0, which is appropriate given the code.\n\nThe only point of note is the future copyright year (2025). While unusual, it does not impact security or suggest malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n---\n\n### Final notes:\n\n- The scores given in all reports are reasonable and consistent.\n- No changes needed.\n- The reports correctly identify the script as benign and standard.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe setup script is a typical, safe packaging configuration with no malicious or suspicious elements. The provided scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
