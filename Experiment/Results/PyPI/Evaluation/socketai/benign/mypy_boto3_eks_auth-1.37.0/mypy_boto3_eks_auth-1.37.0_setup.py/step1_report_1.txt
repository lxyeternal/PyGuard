{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package named 'mypy-boto3-eks-auth', intended to package and distribute type annotations for boto3 EKS authentication.",
  "sources": "Reads the __file__ attribute to determine the directory, reads the README.md file for long description, and imports external modules (setuptools).",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or execute untrusted input or data that could lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to critical functions or data handling points. The code is straightforward configuration with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or unusual constructs. The copyright date in the header is set in the future (2025), but this alone is not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports Path and setuptools, reads a markdown file for description, and calls setup() with static parameters for packaging. There are no dynamic evaluations, no use of exec, eval, or os.system, and no external data processing or input handling that could be malicious. The setup script appears standard and safe. The only noteworthy aspect is the future copyright year (2025), which may be a typo or intentional placeholder but is not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for packaging a Python project. It contains no malicious or suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. No malware or security risks are present.",
