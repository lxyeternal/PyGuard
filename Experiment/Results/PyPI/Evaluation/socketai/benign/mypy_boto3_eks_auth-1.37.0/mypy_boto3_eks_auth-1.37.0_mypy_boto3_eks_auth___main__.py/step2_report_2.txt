  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The script is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package information or version number.\n- It checks for the `--version` argument; if present, it prints the version, otherwise, it prints package info.\n- The code uses only standard library (`sys`) and no dynamic or external data sources.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious code are present.\n- The output is static, informational, and straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present in the code?**  \n  **No.** All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, static, and straightforward.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning?**  \n  **No.** The reports consistently conclude that the code is safe, with high confidence (1.0), and no anomalies or suspicious behaviors.\n\n- **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n  All reports assign:\n  - `malware: 0`\n  - `obfuscated: 0`\n  - `securityRisk: 0`  \n  These are reasonable given the code's simplicity and static nature.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n  None of the reports assign high scores; all are 0, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Malware score considerations:**  \n  Since the code only outputs static information and does not perform any malicious activity, a malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. All reports are cautious and based on observable code behavior, not assumptions.\n\n- **Consistency of scores with the report content:**  \n  All scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Observations:\n- The code is a minimal CLI utility for informational purposes.\n- No dynamic input handling, no network activity, no code obfuscation, no suspicious patterns.\n- The reports are thorough and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the code and reports, I concur with the evaluations. The code is benign, with no security issues, no malware, and no obfuscation.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a straightforward CLI script with no malicious intent, no vulnerabilities, and no obfuscation. The static nature and absence of external interactions confirm its safety.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and align with the code's behavior. No changes are necessary. The code is safe, benign, and poses no security risk.",
