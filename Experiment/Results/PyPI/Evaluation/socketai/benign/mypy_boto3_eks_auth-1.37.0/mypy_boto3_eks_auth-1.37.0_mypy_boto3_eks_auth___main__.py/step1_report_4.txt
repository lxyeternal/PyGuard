  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint script providing package information and version details.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout for output",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write outputs data to the console",
  "flows": "Command-line input (sys.argv) triggers print_version; outputs sent to stdout",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. Functions are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys and defines functions to print package info and version. It checks for '--version' argument to decide which info to print. No untrusted input processing beyond command-line args, which are standard. No external network access, no data collection, and no malicious code present. No obfuscated code or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI utility for displaying package info and version. It contains no malicious behavior, supply chain threats, or security risks.",
