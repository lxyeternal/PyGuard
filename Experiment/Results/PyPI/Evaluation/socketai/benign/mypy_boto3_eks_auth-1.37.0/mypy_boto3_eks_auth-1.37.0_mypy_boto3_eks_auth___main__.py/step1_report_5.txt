  "purpose": "CLI utility to display package information and version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv).",
  "sinks": "Outputs information to stdout using sys.stdout.write.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--version' triggers print_version(), which outputs version info; otherwise, print_info() outputs package details.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors. No hardcoded secrets or credentials. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or external network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI script that prints package info or version details based on command-line arguments. It imports only sys, uses straightforward conditional logic, and outputs static text. There are no external calls, data leaks, or malicious code patterns detected. The structure and content are consistent with a benign utility script.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs a basic informational task with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a safe, standard CLI entrypoint for displaying package details.",
