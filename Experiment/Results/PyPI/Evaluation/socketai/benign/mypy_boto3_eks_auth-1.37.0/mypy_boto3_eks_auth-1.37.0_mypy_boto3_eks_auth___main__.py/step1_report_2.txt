  "purpose": "The code provides CLI commands to display package information and version for a Python package related to boto3 EKSAuth.",
  "sources": "The code reads command-line arguments via sys.argv and writes output to stdout.",
  "sinks": "The code writes package info and version info to stdout.",
  "flows": "User input (--version) flows from sys.argv to conditional check, then triggers print_version() output; otherwise, print_info() outputs package details.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. No dynamic execution or obfuscated code. The code functions as a simple CLI interface.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys for command-line handling and defines functions to print package info and version. The main() function checks for '--version' argument to decide which output to produce. The script's behavior is straightforward and related solely to displaying static information. No malicious or suspicious activity is present; it does not handle or process untrusted input beyond a basic argument check, and all outputs are static strings. There are no anomalies, no data leaks, or code injection points.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package info and version details. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
