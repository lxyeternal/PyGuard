  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The script is a straightforward CLI utility that outputs static package information or version details.\n- It checks for the `--version` argument and prints relevant info accordingly.\n- No external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code:** None. The code is simple, static, and well-structured.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Security risks:** None apparent; the script is benign and purely informational.\n\n### Review of the reports:\n- All five reports consistently describe the code as a benign CLI utility that outputs static information.\n- They correctly identify that the code does not process untrusted input beyond a simple argument check, does not perform network activity, and contains no malicious patterns.\n- The analysis in each report is accurate and aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n### Scores:\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Security risk:** All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- The reports are thorough and consistent; no contradictions or errors are evident.\n- The reasoning is sound, with no assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent beyond static analysis.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code is purely static, with no external dependencies or dynamic behavior, a **risk score of 0.5 or higher** would be unjustified.\n- The **malware score** is correctly 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- The **obfuscated score** is 0, as the code is clear.\n- The **security risk** is 0, as there are no vulnerabilities or risks present.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate and appropriately rated.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThis code is a benign, straightforward CLI utility with no security issues or malicious intent. The scores assigned are reasonable and justified based on the code's behavior. No modifications are necessary.\n\n**Overall estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the code's simplicity and safety.",
