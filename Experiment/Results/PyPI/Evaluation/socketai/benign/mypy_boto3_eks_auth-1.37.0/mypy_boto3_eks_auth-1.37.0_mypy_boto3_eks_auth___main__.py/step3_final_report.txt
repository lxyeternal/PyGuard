  "purpose": "Provide a simple CLI utility that outputs static package information or version details based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv; outputs static strings to stdout.",
  "sinks": "stdout for displaying package info or version; no untrusted data processing or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check (sys.argv) leads to printing version or info strings; no external data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; static, straightforward code with no obfuscation, external dependencies, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static CLI script that outputs predefined package info or version based on a command-line argument. It uses only standard library functions, with no external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are present. Multiple expert reviews confirm the code's benign nature, with consistent scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The logic is simple, transparent, and aligns with best practices for static informational scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static CLI utility with no malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. All expert assessments and the code's behavior support a conclusion of no security concerns. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, which are appropriate given the static, informational nature of the script.",
