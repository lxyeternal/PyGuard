  "purpose": "Define type annotations for various AWS service literals to improve type safety and code clarity in Python projects.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the module's own variable definitions, particularly the string literals assigned to type aliases.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain data sinks; it merely defines type aliases without any data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted data; the literals are static and predefined.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains extensive lists of string literals for AWS service names and regions, which appear to be autogenerated or comprehensive. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are evident. The initial copyright notice claiming to be from 2025 seems inconsistent with the rest of the code (assuming current date is before 2025), but this is likely just a typo or placeholder, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines string literal types for AWS service identifiers and regions. It imports 'Literal' conditionally based on Python version, which is standard practice. There are no functions, data processing, or external data sources. The large lists are static and serve as type annotations. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are present. The copyright date appears inconsistent but does not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "The module is a benign, straightforward set of type alias definitions for AWS services and regions. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. The code’s structure and content are consistent with safe type annotation practices.",
