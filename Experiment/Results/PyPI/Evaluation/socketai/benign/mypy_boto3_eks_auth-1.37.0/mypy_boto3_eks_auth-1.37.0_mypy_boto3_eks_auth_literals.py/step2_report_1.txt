  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines type literals for AWS services, resources, and regions for type checking.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No dynamic or malicious behavior; static definitions.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** Correctly states the code is purely static, with no malware or security risk. Malware score 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0. Confidence 1.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, static string literals for AWS types.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No dynamic behavior or external data; straightforward static code.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** No malicious intent or security risk. Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0. Confidence 1.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Static type annotations for AWS services and regions.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No signs of obfuscation or malicious code; purely static definitions.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** No security issues. Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0. Confidence 1.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Static constants for AWS identifiers.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No dynamic code, no external data, no malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** No security risk or malware. Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0. Confidence 1.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar static type definitions.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; large lists seem autogenerated but benign.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** No malicious activity or security risk. Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** All reports agree that the code is static, well-structured, and purely for type annotations.\n- **Errors or Flaws:** No logical errors, flaws, or suspicious patterns identified in any report.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and risk scores as 0, which is appropriate given the content.\n- **Justification for Scores:** The code contains no runtime behavior, no external input, no network or file I/O, and no obfuscation or malicious code. The large lists are static and serve as type hints only.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- The copyright year \"2025\" is inconsistent with the current date (assuming pre-2025), but this is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n- No signs of backdoors, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- The purpose is purely to facilitate type checking and code clarity.\n\n---\n\n### Final verdict:\n\n**Malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Risk score:** **0**  \n\nThe code is a benign static type definition module with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate. The code is safe, static, and serves as a type hinting utility for AWS services and regions. No changes needed to the scores or conclusions.",
