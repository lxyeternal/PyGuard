  "purpose": "Define type literals for AWS service names, regions, and resource types for type annotations and documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "Static definitions of string literals assigned to variables such as EKSAuthServiceName, ServiceName, ResourceServiceName, and RegionName.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code does not process untrusted input or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code purely defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward, static type definitions with no dynamic code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated constructs, and no network or file I/O.",
  "analysis": "The code imports conditional typing support, defines string literal types for various AWS services, regions, and resource categories, and includes only static data. It follows standard Python syntax for type annotations and does not include any code execution, input handling, or external communications. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or hidden functionalities. The purpose is purely to provide well-documented, type-safe constants for use in type annotations or documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves as a static, well-documented set of string literals for AWS service identifiers and regions. No malicious activity or security risks are present.",
