  "purpose": "Define type literals for AWS service names, resource types, and regions to facilitate type checking and code validation in boto3-based projects.",
  "sources": "Import statements, including sys and typing, and the assignment of Literal type variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code only defines constants and does not handle untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; the code is static type definition without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code consists solely of type alias definitions, imports, and constants with no dynamic or suspicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for AWS services, resources, and regions, using conditional import for typing.Literal to maintain compatibility across Python versions. No input handling, network communication, or runtime data processing occurs. The structure is straightforward and static. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. The extensive list of service names and regions appears to be a comprehensive static resource for type safety, not a vector for malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static type definition module for AWS services, regions, and resources. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It simply provides type aliases for use elsewhere. No malware or security threats are detected.",
