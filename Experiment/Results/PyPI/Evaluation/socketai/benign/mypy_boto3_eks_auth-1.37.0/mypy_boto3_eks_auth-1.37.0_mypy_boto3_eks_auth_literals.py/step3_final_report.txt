  "purpose": "Define static string literal types for AWS services, resource types, and regions to facilitate type checking and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Static string literals assigned to variables, imported conditionally based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "None; no runtime data, external input, or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static definitions without data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward static type definitions. The copyright year '2025' appears inconsistent with current date, likely a placeholder or typo.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type alias definitions for AWS service names, resource types, and regions, with conditional import for 'Literal' for compatibility. No dynamic code, network activity, secrets, or obfuscation are present. All signals indicate benign static data used for type annotations. The large lists are static and serve as type hints only. No suspicious patterns, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The copyright year '2025' is likely a placeholder, not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static module providing type annotations for AWS services, resources, and regions. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriately set to 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The code is safe and serves its purpose as a type hinting utility.",
