  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various AWS service names, resource types, and regions using Python type annotations.",
  "sources": "Constant assignments for type literals; imports of sys, typing, and typing_extensions",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data processing or external data handling identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only declares type literals.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. The code is straightforward type annotation definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides static type aliases for AWS service names, resource types, and regions, primarily for type checking and documentation purposes. It imports necessary modules, defines literals, and conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version. No external data input, network calls, or data manipulation is present. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or backdoors. The structure is clean and standard for type definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, well-structured set of type annotations for AWS-related literals. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, nor does it pose security risks. It appears to be intended solely for type safety and improved code clarity.",
