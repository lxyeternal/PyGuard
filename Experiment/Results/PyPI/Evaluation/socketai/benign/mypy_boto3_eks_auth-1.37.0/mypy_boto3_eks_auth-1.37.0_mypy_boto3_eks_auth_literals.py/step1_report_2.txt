{
  "purpose": "Defines type annotations for various AWS service names, regions, and resource types for use in type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Static string literals assigned to type aliases; no dynamic input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines constants and type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. The code strictly defines literals and handles Python version compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily imports modules and defines type aliases for string literals representing AWS service names, regions, and resource types. It conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version. The literals include comprehensive lists of AWS services and regions, serving as type hints for other code. There are no dynamic or executable behaviors, no external data processing, and no indications of malicious intent. The code is straightforward, likely generated or maintained as part of a typing stub package, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious code segments.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for defining type annotations for AWS-related strings and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as a static type hinting utility, with no suspicious or harmful components.",
