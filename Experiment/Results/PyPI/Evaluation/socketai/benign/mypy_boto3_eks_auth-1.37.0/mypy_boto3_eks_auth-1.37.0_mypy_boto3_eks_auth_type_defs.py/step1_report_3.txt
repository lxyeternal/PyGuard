  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for eks-auth service, primarily for type checking and documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads static type definitions and annotations; no dynamic input or data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data processing or output are present; the code only defines data structures.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely establishes type definitions without runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code is a standard type definition module.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally imports modules based on Python version, defining TypedDicts to specify data schemas. No runtime or external data handling occurs. The code appears to be straightforward and adheres to typical Python typing conventions. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of type definitions intended for static type checking in a Python project. It contains no malicious behavior, no data leaks, and no suspicious activities.",
