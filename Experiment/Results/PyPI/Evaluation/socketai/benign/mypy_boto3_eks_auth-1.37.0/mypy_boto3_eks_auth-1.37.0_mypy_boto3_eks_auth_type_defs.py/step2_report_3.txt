  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the findings with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is purely a set of type definitions using TypedDict, with conditional imports for Python version compatibility.\n- No runtime logic, data processing, external data handling, or network activity.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.\n- The purpose is for static type checking and documentation support.\n- The copyright notice and documentation link do not influence behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** The code does not contain any functional logic, external data handling, or executable code. It is solely type annotations.\n- **Malicious activity:** None observed. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- **Errors or flaws:** The code appears well-structured, with appropriate use of conditional imports and typing extensions.\n\n### Specific points:\n- The scores for malware are consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The security risk scores are also 0, which is reasonable given the benign nature.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- The confidence scores are high (1 or 1.0), reflecting certainty about benign nature.\n\n### Potential issues or points of contention:\n- The reports mention \"sources\" as external sources, but in this code, all data is static and defined within the module.\n- The reports emphasize the absence of anomalies, which is accurate.\n- No mention of potential future vulnerabilities or risks, which is appropriate given the static nature.\n\n### Justification for scores:\n- **Malware score (0):** Correct, no malicious code present.\n- **Obfuscated score (0):** Correct, code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score (0):** Appropriate, no security risks identified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the detailed analysis, the code is a benign, well-structured set of type definitions with no signs of malicious activity or security issues.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (consistent with reports)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (consistent)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate. The code is safe, with no malicious or obfuscated content, and the risk is negligible.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. No changes to scores are necessary.",
