  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for eks-auth service interactions, mainly for type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; only static type definitions and imports.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data outputs; purely type definitions.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; static type definitions are used for type checking only.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type definitions using TypedDict, with conditional imports based on Python version, to facilitate type safety. It imports standard libraries and typing extensions without any dynamic or insecure operations. No code executes at runtime beyond import statements and type annotations. There are no network operations, data handling, or logic that could be malicious. The copyright notice and documentation link do not influence code behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe set of type definitions intended for static type checking. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this code segment.",
