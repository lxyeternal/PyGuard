  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code consists solely of static type definitions, with no runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions.\n- The code uses conditional imports based on Python version, which is standard practice.\n- No suspicious or malicious constructs are identified in any report.\n- The purpose is clearly for static type checking and documentation, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, aligning with the analysis that there is no malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which makes sense given the straightforward, readable code.\n- The security risk score is 0, which is appropriate for pure type definitions with no runtime or external data handling.\n\n**Scores justification:**\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the detailed analyses.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), reflecting the thorough review and agreement among reports.\n\n**Potential issues or assumptions:**\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is benign and solely for type annotations.\n- No discrepancies or unreasonable score assignments are observed.\n- The use of `datetime` in CredentialsTypeDef is appropriate; it doesn't introduce risk or obfuscation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Based on the detailed reviews, I concur with the assessments.\n- The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores are reasonable and justified.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Final note:**\nThis code appears to be a well-structured, safe set of type definitions intended solely for static analysis and documentation purposes.",
