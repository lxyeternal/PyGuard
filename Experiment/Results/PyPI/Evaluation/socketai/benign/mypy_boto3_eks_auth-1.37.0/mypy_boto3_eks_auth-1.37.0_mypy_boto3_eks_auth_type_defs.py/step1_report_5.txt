  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for eks-auth service to facilitate type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; all data definitions are static and part of type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed; this code is purely type definitions and static structures.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or runtime data processing; only type definitions are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. No malicious or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines type annotations for various data structures used in an eks-auth context. It conditionally imports typing modules based on Python version, which is standard. All classes are simple TypedDicts representing data schemas with no runtime logic, input handling, or data manipulation. No external inputs or network operations are present. The code appears to be well-structured, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. The purpose is solely to facilitate static type checking and documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of type definitions intended for static type checking. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
