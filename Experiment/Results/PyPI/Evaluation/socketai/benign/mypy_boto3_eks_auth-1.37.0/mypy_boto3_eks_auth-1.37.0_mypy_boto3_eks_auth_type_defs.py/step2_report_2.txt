  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code provides static type definitions for the eks-auth service, including request and response data structures.\n- It uses conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions.\n- It only defines data structures with no runtime logic, external data handling, or executable code.\n- The copyright date is set to 2025, which is in the future relative to current dates, but this is not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code matches the description: it is solely type annotations and data structure definitions.\n- No signs of code execution, data processing, or external data handling.\n- No embedded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns.\n- The conditional imports are standard practice and do not introduce security issues.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- The only potential concern is the copyright year \"2025,\" which is in the future. While not malicious, it could be a typo or an oversight. However, this does not impact security.\n- No actual executable or runtime code is present, so no attack vectors exist in this context.\n\n### Malware and obfuscation:\n- All reports correctly identify malware and obfuscated scores as zero.\n- The code is transparent, well-structured, and serves purely as type annotations.\n\n### Risk scores:\n- The reports assign a risk score of 0 or 0.5, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- Since there are no malicious behaviors, the scores seem reasonable.\n\n### Justification for scores:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity observed.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk or vulnerabilities present.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The reports correctly challenge any assumptions of malicious intent, citing the lack of suspicious patterns.\n- The use of conditional imports and type annotations aligns with best practices.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a benign, well-structured set of type definitions with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. They correctly identify that this code is purely for static type checking and documentation, with no malicious or security-risk elements. The only minor note is the future copyright year, which is not a security issue but worth correcting for accuracy.\n\n**Overall recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
