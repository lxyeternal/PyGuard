  "purpose": "Type definitions for eks-auth service type annotations, facilitating static type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Static data structures defined within the module, including type annotations and conditional imports.",
  "sinks": "None; the code contains no runtime data handling or external data sources.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is purely declarative with no data flow or execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The code provides static type definitions using TypedDict, with conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. It contains no executable logic, external data handling, or network interactions. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The purpose is solely for static type checking and documentation. The code's simplicity and lack of runtime behavior indicate zero security risks and malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, well-structured set of type definitions with no security concerns or malicious behavior. The scores are appropriately set to zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, reflecting its safe and static nature.",
