  "purpose": "Type annotations for eks-auth service type definitions to facilitate static type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Input data appears to be from external sources such as API responses or user input, notably in type definitions for request and response objects.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; no data processing, storage, or transmission functions are present. The code primarily defines data structures.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows are depicted; the code only declares type structures for potential use elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses conditional imports based on Python version, which is standard. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. No dynamic execution or external data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "This module provides only type definitions and import logic, with no executable or malicious code. It imports necessary modules and defines data structures to be used for type annotations. The use of conditional imports based on Python version is standard practice. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The code is clean, well-structured, and serves a purely documentation/typing purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of type definitions intended for static analysis and documentation, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
