  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for eks-auth service, primarily for type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "None (pure type definitions and imports).",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing, I/O, or external communication.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this code only defines types.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. Use of conditional imports based on Python version is standard practice for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type definitions for various data structures related to eks-auth, including request and response types. It uses standard Python typing modules and conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. No data processing, input handling, or external network activities are present. The use of datetime for expiration in credentials is appropriate and does not pose an immediate security risk. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data leakage points. The code appears to be a straightforward and well-structured set of type annotations.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists solely of type definitions and import statements, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign utility module meant for type hinting and documentation support.",
