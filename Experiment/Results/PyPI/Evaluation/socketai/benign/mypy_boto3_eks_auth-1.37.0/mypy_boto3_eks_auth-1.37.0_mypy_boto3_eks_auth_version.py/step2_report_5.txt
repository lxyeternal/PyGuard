  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward static assignment of a version string to `__version__`. There are no inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors, and the code is standard for package versioning. Therefore, **no issues or vulnerabilities are present** in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly note the absence of anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious behavior. No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.0, which is appropriate given the simplicity and transparency of the code.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no malicious activity.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0, which is reasonable.\n\nThese scores are consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nSince the code is a benign version declaration with no dynamic or external interactions, **risk scores should remain at 0**. There is no indication of vulnerabilities, malware, or obfuscation that would justify higher scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Considerations**  \nThe malware score is correctly set to 0 across all reports. The code does not perform any malicious actions, nor does it contain obfuscated or suspicious patterns.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nAll reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as a standard, harmless version assignment.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nThe scores are consistent with the code's nature and the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation and My Own Estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — No malicious activity or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — No security risks or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Overall, the code is a minimal, standard version declaration with no security concerns.**",
