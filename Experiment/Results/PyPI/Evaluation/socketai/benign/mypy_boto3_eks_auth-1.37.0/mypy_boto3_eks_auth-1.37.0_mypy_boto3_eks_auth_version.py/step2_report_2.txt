  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward assignment of a static version string to the `__version__` variable.\n   - The code includes only a comment, a copyright notice, and the assignment.\n   - No input/output, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - No report indicates any suspicious behavior, obfuscated code, or malicious logic.\n   - The code is standard for Python packages, serving as metadata.\n\n3. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Risks:**\n   - Static version strings are common and generally benign.\n   - No evidence of hardcoded credentials, secrets, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No data flows or untrusted data handling.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Confidence levels are high (1.0), reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - The scores seem consistent with the analysis.\n\n5. **Critical Evaluation:**\n   - Given the simplicity, there is no basis for higher risk scores.\n   - The code does not do anything malicious, nor does it contain obfuscation or vulnerabilities.\n   - The comments and structure are standard.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no security concerns. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the analysis above.",
