  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string (`__version__ = \"1.37.0\"`) with a copyright comment.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, external interactions, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The code is static, minimal, and follows common practices for Python package versioning.\n\n2. **Potential Security Concerns**:\n   - No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious logic are present.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or sensitive data.\n   - No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.\n   - No external data or network activity.\n   - The version string is static and unchanging.\n\n3. **Malware & Obfuscation Scores**:\n   - All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which is consistent with the code content.\n   - The code is not obfuscated; it's a simple string assignment.\n\n4. **Risk Scores & Justification**:\n   - All reports assign a security risk of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The confidence level is high (1), as the analysis is consistent across reports.\n\n5. **Any Discrepancies or Issues?**\n   - No discrepancies or errors are evident.\n   - The logic and reasoning are sound and align with standard practices.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment**:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion**:\n\nThe code is a typical, benign version declaration with no security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and accurate. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation**:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious or suspicious features.",
