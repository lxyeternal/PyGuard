  "purpose": "Declare the package version as a static string assigned to __version__.",
  "sources": "No data inputs; static assignment of __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a simple static string assignment with a comment and copyright notice.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment, a copyright notice, and a static string assignment to __version__. It does not perform any data processing, input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The code is standard for Python package versioning and contains no suspicious or malicious patterns. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the benign nature. Confidence is high due to the simplicity and clarity of the code. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static version declaration with no security risks or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
