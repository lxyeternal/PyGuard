  "purpose": "Define the version of the package or module",
  "sources": "The assignment of the string '1.37.0' to __version__",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; __version__ is a static string assignment",
  "flows": "No data flows or input/output interactions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; only a version string assignment and a comment",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a comment, a copyright notice, and a version string assignment. There are no data inputs, no code execution, no external data sources, and no suspicious behavior. The version string is hardcoded, which is common practice in package versioning. No obfuscated code, malicious logic, or data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple static version assignment with no malicious intent or security risks.",
