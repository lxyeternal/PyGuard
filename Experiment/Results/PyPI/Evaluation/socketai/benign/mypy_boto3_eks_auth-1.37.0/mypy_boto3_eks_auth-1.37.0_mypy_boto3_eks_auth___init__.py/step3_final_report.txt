{
  "purpose": "Provides a minimal interface for the eks-auth service by importing and exposing the EKSAuthClient class.",
  "sources": "Import statement from local module '.client' and the documentation string.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted input; straightforward import and export.",
  "anomalies": "The only minor anomaly is the future year 2025 in the copyright comment, which is likely a placeholder.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple Python module that imports a class from a local module, assigns it to a variable, and exposes it via __all__. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or data handling. The documentation and comments are standard. No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or external data flows are present. The only unusual aspect is the future year in the comment, which does not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and safe. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected. The minor future date comment is not a security concern. All scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1) justified by the minor anomaly.",
