  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code and the reports' conclusions, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward Python module that imports a class from a local module, assigns it to a variable, and exposes it via `__all__`.\n- The documentation includes usage examples and a copyright notice.\n- No dynamic code, data handling, network activity, or external inputs are present.\n- The code appears to be a typical interface layer for a client SDK.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; the code provides an interface by importing and exposing `EKSAuthClient`.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or complex data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, only standard comments.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; the code is benign, standard, and safe.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - **malware:** 0 — appropriate.  \n  - **obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.  \n  - **securityRisk:** 0 — no risks.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, with slightly more emphasis on documentation and the copyright year.\n\n- **Anomalies:** The copyright year is 2025, which is in the future, but this is likely a placeholder or oversight, not malicious.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - **malware:** 0 — appropriate.  \n  - **obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.  \n  - **securityRisk:** 0.1 — very low, probably just a conservative placeholder.\n\n**Verdict:** No security issues; scores are acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- Same general assessment; the code is a minimal interface module.\n\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, just import and export.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - **malware:** 0 — correct.  \n  - **obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.  \n  - **securityRisk:** 0 — no apparent risks.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- Similar to previous reports, with mention of the future year 2025.\n\n- **Anomalies:** Future date, but not suspicious.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - **malware:** 0 — appropriate.  \n  - **obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.  \n  - **securityRisk:** 0.1 — very low, consistent with the rest.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- Same as above, with mention of no external input, simple import/export.\n\n- **Anomalies:** Future year 2025 again, but not malicious.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - **malware:** 0 — correct.  \n  - **obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.  \n  - **securityRisk:** 0.1 — consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports, reflecting minimal concern over the future date in comments, but not a real security risk.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0 — the code is benign; the only \"anomaly\" is the future year, which is not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n### **Final notes:**\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The scores assigned are reasonable given the code's simplicity. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a benign, standard interface module.\n- No malware or obfuscation is present.\n- The minor future date in comments is not a security concern.\n\n**Therefore, I agree with the current scoring and assessments.**",
