  "purpose": "Provide the main interface for the eks-auth service, facilitating access to the EKSAuthClient through a simplified interface.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; only static imports and definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks related to untrusted data or potential vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code merely defines and exports a client alias.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a date in 2025, which is future-dated, possibly indicating placeholder or inconsistent comment or copyright info. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code structures observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports a client class, assigns it to a variable, and defines module exports. There is no user input handling, network activity, or data processing. The code appears to be a straightforward module setup for an SDK or library interface. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple interface module with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain any suspicious behavior or vulnerabilities. The only minor anomaly is the future-dated copyright year, which is likely a placeholder or oversight.",
