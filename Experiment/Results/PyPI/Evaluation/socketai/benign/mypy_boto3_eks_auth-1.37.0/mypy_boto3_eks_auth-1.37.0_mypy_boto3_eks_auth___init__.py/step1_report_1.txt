{
  "purpose": "Provides the main interface for the eks-auth service by importing and exposing the EKSAuthClient class.",
  "sources": "Imports from .client module and the code itself referencing the EKSAuthClient class.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in the code.",
  "flows": "The code flows from import statements to assigning EKSAuthClient to Client and exporting symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code are observed. The code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the EKSAuthClient class from a local module, assigns it to a variable Client, and exposes it via __all__. It includes a documentation comment with usage examples and a copyright notice. There are no dynamic code execution, data handling, or external network interactions. The structure and content are typical for a module interface file, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a simple interface module for the eks-auth service, with no malicious or security-threatening behavior detected. It appears to be a standard, safe module setup.",
