{
  "purpose": "Provides the main interface for the eks-auth service, allowing users to instantiate a client for AWS EKS authentication.",
  "sources": "Imports the EKSAuthClient class from a local module; no external data sources or user input handling present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling; no output or network operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code mainly involves class import, aliasing, and module exports.",
  "anomalies": "Contains only import statements, documentation, and module export syntax with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports a client class, assigns an alias, and defines exports. It includes a docstring with documentation and example usage, but no runtime logic, data handling, or network activity. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward module setup for a Python package interface, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
