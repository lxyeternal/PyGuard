  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the security implications, scores, and any inconsistencies.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a minimal, straightforward module that imports a class (`EKSAuthClient`) from a local module, assigns it to a variable (`Client`), and exposes it via `__all__`.\n- The documentation includes usage examples and links, with no dynamic or external data handling.\n- No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is evident.\n- The only minor anomaly noted is the future-dated copyright year (2025), which is likely a placeholder or oversight.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Score: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0**\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious or suspicious activity detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Score: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1**\n- **Assessment:** The security risk is minimal; the code is very simple and safe. The small risk score seems to reflect the potential for future issues if the module were to be extended maliciously, but as-is, it's benign.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Score: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0**\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Score: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1**\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. The future date is a minor anomaly, but not a security concern.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Score: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1**\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code remains benign.\n\n---\n\n### Overall evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Risk score:** Given the simplicity and benign nature, a risk score of 0 or 0.1 is appropriate. The reports' use of 0.1 for minor anomalies (like future-dated copyright) is reasonable.\n\n### Final recommendation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across the board — consistent and justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Should remain at 0 or 0.1; the current scores are reasonable.\n\n### Additional notes:\n\n- The future date (2025) is likely a placeholder or oversight, not malicious.\n- No evidence of code injection, external data handling, or suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- **The code is a standard, safe module interface with no malicious intent.**\n- **Scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.**\n- **No changes needed.**\n\n**Final estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to minor anomalies like future date, but overall very low risk)\n\nThis thorough review confirms the code's benign nature and appropriate scoring.",
