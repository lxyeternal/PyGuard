  "purpose": "Main interface module for eks-auth service, providing access to the EKSAuthClient class for users.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the local module (.client), and the usage documentation string.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, user input, or external data processing evident in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code primarily defines an interface and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a copyright date set to 2025, which is in the future, but this is not suspicious for malicious intent; no hardcoded secrets or unusual code features.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a documentation string, import statements, a class alias assignment, and export definitions. It does not perform any data processing, network operations, or contain code that could be exploited. The structure is typical for a Python module exposing a client class. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward interface definition with no malicious or security-threatening elements. It is unlikely to be malicious or harmful.",
