  "purpose": "Provides an interface for the eks-auth service, acting as a module that exposes a client class for interacting with the service.",
  "sources": "Imports EKSAuthClient from a relative module, and references to session creation and client instantiation in the usage documentation.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data; no data handling or network operations are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are present within this code snippet; it only defines imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The comment references documentation and a copyright statement but no embedded malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module setup that imports a client class from a relative module and assigns it to a variable for external use. The documentation block includes sample usage and a link to external docs. There are no code execution, data handling, or network operations present. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a simple interface layer exposing the EKSAuthClient class. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks. It appears to be a benign part of a larger package.",
