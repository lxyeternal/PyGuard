  "purpose": "Type annotations and class definitions for the eks-auth service client, enabling type-checked interactions with AWS EKS Auth API.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local type_defs; class method definitions.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no processing of untrusted data, network, or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code primarily defines classes and method signatures without data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears to be straightforward type annotations, class structures, and documentation links.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a Python client interface for AWS EKS Auth, including exception class mappings and method signatures for interacting with the API. It conditionally imports modules based on Python version, defines exception types, and provides method signatures for client operations. There are no data processing, network interactions, or dynamic code execution observed. All imports and class structures are standard for SDK type stubs. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard type stub and class definition for AWS SDK interactions, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
