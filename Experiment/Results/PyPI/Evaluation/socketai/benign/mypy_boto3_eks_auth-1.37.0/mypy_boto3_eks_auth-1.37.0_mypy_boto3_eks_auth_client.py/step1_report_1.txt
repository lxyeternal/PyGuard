{
  "purpose": "This code defines type annotations and client class for the eks-auth service, primarily for static type checking and documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads the system version info, standard library modules, and internal type definitions.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; no untrusted data output or sensitive data leakage points identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code mainly defines class interfaces and type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed. No malicious backdoors or covert channels are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard type annotation and client class definition for AWS's boto3 SDK, extended with custom exception classes and method signatures. It includes environment checks for compatibility, imports, and class declarations. The methods mainly specify expected parameters and return types, with no dynamic execution, data manipulation, or external communications. No potential malicious patterns such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code appears to be a benign, well-structured interface layer designed for static type support and documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward type annotation and client interface definition for the eks-auth AWS service. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks. It is safe and serves primarily as a type-hinting aid for developers.",
