  "purpose": "Type annotations and class definitions for the eks-auth service client, providing a structured interface for interacting with AWS EKS authentication API.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local type_defs; class and method definitions; properties and docstrings.",
  "sinks": "None detected. The code primarily defines type annotations and class interfaces, with no data sinks or external calls.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted inputs leading to security-sensitive operations; mainly static type annotations and class properties.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or hardcoded secrets observed. The code is straightforward, focusing on type hints and class structure.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a typed interface for a boto3 client, including exception classes and methods for generating URLs and assuming roles. All components are standard, with no evidence of malicious behavior. There are no network calls, data leaks, or suspicious logic. The use of type hints and dynamic features is appropriate and safe. The code appears to be a benign stub for AWS SDK interaction.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a secure, well-structured type stub for the EKSAuth boto3 client, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
