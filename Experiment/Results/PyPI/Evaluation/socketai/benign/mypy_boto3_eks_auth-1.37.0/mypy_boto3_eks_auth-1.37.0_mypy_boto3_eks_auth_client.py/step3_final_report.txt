{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface definitions for the eks-auth service, primarily serving as static type stubs for documentation and static analysis.",
  "sources": "Method signatures accepting parameters, class properties, and exception class definitions; no data input/output or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data leaks, external calls, or untrusted data handling within the code.",
  "flows": "Parameter passing in method signatures; no runtime data flow or dynamic execution occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements; standard SDK stub structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, interface-only module defining classes, properties, and method signatures for the eks-auth client. It contains no executable logic, network activity, or data processing. The exception classes and method signatures are standard for SDK type stubs. The minimal potential for misuse is inherent in the design but does not indicate malicious intent. The security risk score in one report (0.1) slightly overstates the actual risk; a score of 0 would be more accurate. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0, reflecting the benign, straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured static type stub for the eks-auth AWS SDK client, with no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. All reports are consistent with this assessment, with a minor overestimation of risk in one case. The overall security posture is safe, and the code poses no threat.",
