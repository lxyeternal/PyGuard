  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes the code as a type annotation and client class for eks-auth, with no suspicious sources or sinks.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is standard, with no malicious patterns, backdoors, or data leaks. It serves as a static type stub.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0 — **appropriate**.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; the code is benign and purely for type annotations.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on structured interface definitions.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Again, standard, with no malicious behaviors. No dynamic code or external communications.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0 — **appropriate**.\n\n**Assessment:** No concerns; the code is a straightforward SDK stub.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Notes potential data flow in methods like `generate_presigned_url` and `assume_role_for_pod_identity`.\n- **Analysis:** These methods accept parameters that could include untrusted data, but they are just method signatures with no implementation or data processing shown. The code does not perform any network calls or data handling itself; it’s a type stub.\n- **Conclusion:** No evidence of malicious behavior; potential data flow is typical for SDK method signatures.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — **reasonable**.\n\n**Note:** The small risk score reflects the potential for misuse if untrusted data is passed at runtime, but as static code, it’s safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous reports, standard class and method signatures.\n- **Analysis:** No dynamic code, network activity, or data processing observed. It’s a typical SDK stub.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent or security risk.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0 — **appropriate**.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, class and method signatures with no suspicious elements.\n- **Analysis:** No data flow or dynamic behavior; purely static definitions.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0 — **appropriate**.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior. The code is a static type stub for AWS SDK, with no runtime code, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** None of the reports suggest obfuscation; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly higher in Report 3 due to potential data flow concerns, but still minimal. The code itself is safe; any risk would depend on runtime usage, which is outside static analysis scope.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a well-structured, standard SDK stub with type annotations, exception mappings, and method signatures.\n- No dynamic or malicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- The only minor concern is the potential for misuse if untrusted data is passed at runtime, but this is typical for SDK interfaces and does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0.0** — No malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.0** — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — Slightly elevated due to potential misuse, but not a security concern in static form.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, standard, and serves as a type stub for AWS SDK interactions. No security risks or malicious behaviors are present.",
