{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for the eks-auth service, facilitating type-safe interactions with AWS EKS Auth API.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local type_defs; class and method definitions; property and function signatures.",
  "sinks": "Potential data flow occurs in methods like generate_presigned_url and assume_role_for_pod_identity, which process parameters and return values that could include untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input parameters in generate_presigned_url and assume_role_for_pod_identity flow through method calls, with generate_presigned_url returning a URL string; assume_role_for_pod_identity returning a response object.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. Usage of standard boto3 and botocore classes with no dynamic code execution or obfuscation. Conditional imports based on sys.version_info are standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations and a class interface for AWS EKS Auth client, leveraging boto3 and botocore. It includes property and method definitions consistent with AWS SDK patterns. No embedded malicious code, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious import patterns. The methods are wrappers with clear input/output annotations, and there are no signs of backdoors, data leaks, or malicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a type-annotated client interface for AWS EKS Auth service, with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate, well-structured SDK wrapper with no suspicious or malicious elements.",
