  "purpose": "Type annotations and class definitions for the EKSAuthClient, a boto3 client wrapper for AWS EKS authentication API.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local type_defs; class attributes and method parameters and return types.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external output is present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code defines structure and typing without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code is standard for a boto3 client stub, with no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs. Conditional imports based on Python version are standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a structured, type-annotated interface for the boto3 EKS Auth client. It imports modules safely, defines exceptions class for boto3 error types, and creates a client class with documented methods. There are no dynamic code executions, external data handling, or suspicious logic. The code appears to be a typical SDK stub for type checking and documentation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured boto3 client stub for AWS EKS Auth service, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely provides type annotations and method signatures for SDK usage.",
