  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured application bootstrap for the Flet framework. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The use of environment variables and dynamic imports is standard practice. The overall security risk is low, with a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a minor risk score of approximately 0.2 due to environmental configuration reliance."
