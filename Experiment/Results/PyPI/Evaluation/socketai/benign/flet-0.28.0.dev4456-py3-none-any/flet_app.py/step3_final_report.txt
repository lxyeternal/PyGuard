  "purpose": "Application bootstrap and environment setup for the Flet framework supporting multiple environments (local, web, embedded, desktop).",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., FLET_SERVER_PORT, FLET_SERVER_IP, FLET_DISPLAY_URL_PREFIX, FLET_ASSETS_DIR), external modules (flet, flet_web, flet_desktop), user-defined target functions, signals (SIGINT, SIGTERM).",
  "sinks": "Network sockets (web server, socket server), subprocess calls (external package installation), environment variables influencing configuration, signal handling for graceful shutdown.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence port and host settings -> server startup functions (web or socket) -> user-defined target functions executed during session creation -> signals trigger shutdown procedures.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables for configuration is standard; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious dynamic code execution detected. Dynamic import of external packages is typical for extensible frameworks.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a multi-mode application supporting embedded, web, desktop, and server environments. It manages environment variables for configuration, handles signals for graceful termination, and dynamically imports necessary packages. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The execution of user-supplied functions (target) is standard in frameworks allowing extensibility, not inherently malicious. The environment variable reliance is typical but should be managed securely. The code's structure and behavior align with legitimate application startup routines, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured application bootstrap for the Flet framework. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The use of environment variables and dynamic imports is standard practice. The overall security risk is low, with a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a minor risk score of approximately 0.2 due to environmental configuration reliance.",
