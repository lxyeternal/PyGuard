{
  "purpose": "This code initializes and manages a web or desktop application using the Flet framework, supporting different environments like Pyodide, web server, or socket server, and handling app startup and session management.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (FLET_SERVER_PORT, FLET_SERVER_IP, FLET_DISPLAY_URL_PREFIX, FLET_SERVER_UDS_PATH, FLET_ASSETS_DIR), user-provided parameters (target, name, host, port, assets_dir, upload_dir), signals (SIGINT, SIGTERM).",
  "sinks": "Network sockets (web server and socket server), subprocesses for opening browser, external package installation, print statements, logging outputs.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence port, host, and URL prefix; signals trigger app shutdown; web and socket servers start and handle session events; external packages are imported and invoked; browser is opened for web view.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables to dynamically set network ports and host IPs; dynamic import of external packages; running application code based on environment detection; conditional execution of external commands like open_in_browser; no suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors; standard signal handling; no obfuscated code or suspicious runtime code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a typical application bootstrap for a cross-platform app framework (Flet). It dynamically adjusts configuration based on environment variables, handles multiple runtime environments, and manages network sessions securely through asyncio and external libraries. No code injection, malicious data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. External package management is explicitly handled with install checks, reducing risk of malicious updates. Signal handling is standard for graceful shutdown. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors. It mainly coordinates app startup, environment adaptation, and session management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical application bootstrap and session management script with no evident malicious intent or security risks. It handles environment variables, external dependencies, and app lifecycle events securely and transparently. No signs of malware, backdoors, or supply chain attacks are detected.",
