  "purpose": "Importing MatplotlibChart class from the flet.core.matplotlib_chart module, likely for creating or rendering charts in a larger application.",
  "sources": "Import statement from external module 'flet.core.matplotlib_chart'. No direct data input or reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing identified within this single line; no potential for data leaks or execution of untrusted code observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths within this single statement; it is a static import with no runtime data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual syntax. The import appears standard.",
  "analysis": "This code only imports a class from a package, which is common in Python projects. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data leakage. Since this is only a single import statement, it provides minimal context; however, based on this, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import statement for a charting component and shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger application intended for plotting or visualization.",
