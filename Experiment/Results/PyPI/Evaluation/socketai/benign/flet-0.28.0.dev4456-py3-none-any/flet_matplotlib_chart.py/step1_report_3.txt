  "sinks": "No sinks present; code does not perform data output, network communication, or execute untrusted input.",
  "flows": "N/A; only an import statement, no data flow or execution logic present.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only an import statement without additional logic or context. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is a straightforward import statement importing a chart class from a module within the Flet framework. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security issues. The import alone does not indicate malicious intent, and the module appears to be a legitimate part of a UI framework.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is benign, serving as a dependency import for chart rendering functionality.",
