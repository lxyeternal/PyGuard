{
  "purpose": "To import the MatplotlibChart class from the flet.core.matplotlib_chart module, likely for creating or manipulating charts within a Flet-based application.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external input or data reading occurs in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potential data leaks are present; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists; the code is a static import statement with no runtime data movement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement importing a class from a known open-source library. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are evident. The import is standard and does not involve dynamic execution, network activity, or data handling. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1, confidence=0.9-1) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward import statement with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports accurately reflect this, and no modifications to scores or assessments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
