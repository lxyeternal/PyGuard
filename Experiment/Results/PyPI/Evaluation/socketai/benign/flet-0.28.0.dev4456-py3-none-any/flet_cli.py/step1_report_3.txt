{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to ensure the 'flet_cli' package is installed and then execute its main CLI function.",
  "sources": "import subprocess, sys, and ensure_flet_cli_package_installed() which likely reads environment and package info.",
  "sinks": "Calls to flet_cli.cli.main() which executes the CLI main function, possibly executing commands within the package.",
  "flows": "ensure_flet_cli_package_installed() ensures the package is installed, then import flet_cli.cli, then runs flet_cli.cli.main(), which could execute arbitrary code within that CLI.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated code present. No use of subprocess or sys is directly exploited; subprocess is imported but not used, which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script ensures the 'flet_cli' package is installed, then imports and runs its main CLI function. No direct execution of untrusted input, no network connections, and no suspicious code structures. The import of subprocess and sys suggests possible future use, but currently unused, which could be a minor concern. Overall, the code simply orchestrates package installation and execution of a CLI tool, with no evident malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward utility to ensure and run a CLI package. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It functions as a controlled bootstrap for the 'flet_cli' package without engaging in harmful activities.",
