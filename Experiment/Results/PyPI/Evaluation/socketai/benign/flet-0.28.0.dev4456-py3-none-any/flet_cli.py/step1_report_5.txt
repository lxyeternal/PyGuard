{
  "purpose": "This script ensures that the 'flet' CLI package is installed and then runs its main CLI function.",
  "sources": "The code imports subprocess, sys, and a utility function 'ensure_flet_cli_package_installed' which likely checks and installs the 'flet' package.",
  "sinks": "The code calls 'flet_cli.cli.main()', which may execute code within the 'flet' package's CLI module. No direct untrusted input handling or external data sinks are visible.",
  "flows": "The script flow involves ensuring installation of 'flet' package, importing its CLI module, and executing its main function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious behaviors, or obfuscated code. The import of 'flet' after installation check appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code starts by importing necessary modules and a utility to ensure the 'flet' CLI package is installed. The 'main' function calls 'ensure_flet_cli_package_installed()', which presumably installs or verifies the package. It then imports the CLI module from 'flet' and executes its main function. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code is straightforward and functions as an installer and launcher for the 'flet' CLI tool. The use of dynamic import after installation check is typical for CLI bootstrap scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign bootstrap script for the 'flet' CLI package. It performs installation verification and launches the package's CLI interface without any suspicious or malicious activity.",
