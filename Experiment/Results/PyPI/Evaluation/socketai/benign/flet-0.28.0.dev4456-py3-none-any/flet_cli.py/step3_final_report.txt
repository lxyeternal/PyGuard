  "purpose": "Ensure the 'flet' CLI package is installed and invoke its main CLI function.",
  "sources": "The function ensure_flet_cli_package_installed() and the import of flet_cli.cli after installation.",
  "sinks": "Calling flet_cli.cli.main() which executes the CLI's main function, potentially running external code.",
  "flows": "ensure_flet_cli_package_installed() ensures package presence -> import flet_cli.cli -> execute flet_cli.cli.main()",
  "anomalies": "Unused imports of subprocess and sys; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation; reliance on external package trust.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward bootstrapper that ensures a package is installed and then runs its CLI main function. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present within this snippet. The primary security concern is the trustworthiness of the external 'flet' package, which could execute malicious code if compromised. The code itself is benign and standard in pattern, with no internal vulnerabilities. The malware score is appropriately 0, as no malicious activity is detected. The obfuscated score is 0, given the clarity of the code. The security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting reliance on external package integrity. The confidence in these conclusions is high (~0.8-0.9).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign bootstrap script for the 'flet' CLI, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The main security consideration is trusting the external package. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
