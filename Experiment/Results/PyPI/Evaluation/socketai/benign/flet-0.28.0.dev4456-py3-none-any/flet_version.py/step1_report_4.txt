{
  "purpose": "Retrieve the current version of the Flet package, either from a predefined string or by inspecting the git repository.",
  "sources": "The code reads the local filesystem to determine the current working directory, the location of the flet package, and executes git commands via subprocess to fetch version information.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess calls to 'git' could be influenced if an attacker controls the environment or the PATH, but this is typical for version retrieval and not inherently malicious. No other untrusted input sources are present.",
  "flows": "The code flows from checking a predefined version string, then conditionally executes git commands if in a repository, fetching the latest tag. It then sets and returns the version string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. The subprocess is used in a typical manner for version control. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or unusual behavior detected. The version update logic is standard.",
  "analysis": "The script's primary function is to determine the package version, either from a hardcoded string or via 'git describe' commands. It changes directories to the package location, runs git commands to get the latest tag, and handles errors accordingly. The subprocess calls are used to interact with git, which is common in versioning scripts. No suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, and no malicious code are present. The code is straightforward, with proper error handling, and does not contain any obfuscation or hidden functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard version retrieval script with no malicious intent. It interacts with the filesystem and external git commands securely and appropriately for its purpose. No signs of malware, sabotage, or malicious behavior are detected.",
