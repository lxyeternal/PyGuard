  "purpose": "Retrieve and update the version of the Flet package, either from a static string or dynamically from Git metadata.",
  "sources": "os.chdir, sp.run, which, and flet.__file__ are used to read the current directory, execute Git commands, and access package path.",
  "sinks": "sp.run executes system commands, which could be exploited if input is manipulated; however, inputs are fixed commands and not influenced by external untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Code checks for Git repository status and describe command output to determine version; no external input influences these commands directly, apart from the local Git repository state.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses subprocess to run Git commands without sanitization, but commands are fixed and not influenced by untrusted input. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves version information either from a static string or by executing Git commands if in a repository. It checks for repository status and describes tags to set version dynamically. No user input or untrusted data is processed; subprocess commands are standard for versioning. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity detected. The code is well-structured for version management.",
  "conclusion": "The code's purpose is legitimate version retrieval; no malicious intent or malware present. The only minor concern is the use of subprocess for Git commands, but these are static commands not influenced by external untrusted input. Overall, it appears safe.",
