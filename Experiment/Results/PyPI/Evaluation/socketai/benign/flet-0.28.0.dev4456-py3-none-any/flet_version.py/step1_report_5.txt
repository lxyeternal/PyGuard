{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to determine and return the current version of the Flet package, either from a static string or dynamically from the Git repository if available.",
  "sources": "Reads from the filesystem (flet.__file__), environment (current working directory), and executes Git commands via subprocess to get version info.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess execution of 'git' commands; no direct data sinks involving untrusted data or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Reads filesystem and environment -> runs Git commands -> processes output -> returns version string.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code. Use of subprocess for Git commands is standard and safe in this context.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily manages version retrieval through filesystem access and calling Git commands via subprocess. It checks if the current directory is a Git repository and attempts to describe the latest tag. The logic includes error handling for Git failures. No malicious code, backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code does not perform any network activity outside executing standard Git commands, which are expected for versioning purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version management utility with no malicious intent or malicious behaviors detected. It does not contain malware or security risks. The use of subprocess for Git commands is normal and safe within this context.",
