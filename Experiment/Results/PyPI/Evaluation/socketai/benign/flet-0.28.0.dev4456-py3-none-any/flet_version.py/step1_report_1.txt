{
  "purpose": "To determine and possibly update the version of the Flet package based on Git repository information.",
  "sources": "Reads from the filesystem (Path().absolute()), environment variables (implicitly via import), and executes Git commands via subprocess.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'git' commands via subprocess which could potentially be exploited if the environment or the commands were manipulated, but in this context, it's used for version retrieval only.",
  "flows": "Reads the current directory and the repository's state, then runs 'git describe' to get version info, returning the version string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity or data leaks. Use of subprocess to run Git commands is standard for version control info.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves version information from the local Git repository, falling back to a default version if not in a repo. It temporarily changes the working directory for Git operations, then restores it. No untrusted input appears to influence subprocess commands or paths. The subprocess commands are standard for version management and do not exhibit malicious intent. No network activity, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard version retrieval utility with no malicious behavior. It performs environment and filesystem checks to determine the package version, with no signs of malicious or sabotage activity.",
