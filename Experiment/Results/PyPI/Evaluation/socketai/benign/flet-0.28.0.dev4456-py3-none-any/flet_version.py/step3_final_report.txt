{
  "purpose": "Retrieve the current version of the 'flet' package, either from a static string or dynamically via Git commands if in a repository.",
  "sources": "Filesystem to determine current directory; subprocess calls to 'git' for version info.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess execution of 'git' commands; no untrusted input or data leaks involved.",
  "flows": "Code changes directory to package location, runs 'git describe --abbrev=0', processes output, then restores directory.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version retrieval logic; no obfuscated code or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard version detection by checking if in a Git repository and executing 'git describe' to get the latest tag. It handles errors gracefully and does not process untrusted input. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data leaks are present. Subprocess calls are fixed and safe, used solely for version info. The initial static version is a placeholder. Overall, the code is a benign utility script with minimal security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, safe implementation for version retrieval with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1-0.2) are appropriate and justified given the code's benign nature.",
