  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-reference with the code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The script retrieves the current version of the 'flet' package.\n- It uses a hardcoded default version (\"0.28.0.dev4456\") initially.\n- If the version is not set and not on mobile, it attempts to update the version by:\n  - Changing directory to the package location.\n  - Checking if the directory is a Git repository.\n  - If so, running `git describe --abbrev=0` to get the latest tag.\n  - Handling errors if Git cannot describe the repository.\n  - Restoring the working directory.\n- No user input influences the subprocess commands.\n- The subprocess commands are standard for version retrieval.\n- No secrets, obfuscated code, or network activity.\n- No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Discrepancies:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports agree that the code performs standard version retrieval with no malicious intent. They confirm the subprocess calls are safe, and no untrusted input influences command execution.  \n  **No issues are found in the code itself.**\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning?**  \n  The reports are consistent, emphasizing that subprocess calls are standard and no malicious behavior is detected. They correctly identify the code's purpose and behavior.  \n  **No significant errors or flaws are evident.**\n\n- **Scores given to each issue:**  \n  All reports assign malware scores of 0, confidence levels around 0.9-1, and security risks close to 0.2 or less. These seem reasonable given the analysis.\n\n- **Justification for higher risk scores (>0.5):**  \n  None of the reports justify high risk scores, and the code's behavior is benign. The highest risk score is 0.2, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Malware score considerations:**  \n  All reports correctly assign malware scores of 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No report makes unwarranted assumptions. They acknowledge the subprocess calls are standard and not influenced by untrusted input.\n\n- **Consistency of scores with the report:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the analysis—no malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (minimal, related to subprocess usage but not risky)\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (standard version retrieval code with negligible risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, standard version retrieval utility with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nNo further action needed. The code is safe, and the reports correctly identify its benign nature.",
