{
  "purpose": "The script retrieves and possibly updates the current version of the 'flet' package, either from a static string or dynamically via Git commands.",
  "sources": "Reads include the 'flet' module's file path, the current working directory, and the output/error of 'git' commands.",
  "sinks": "The 'git' command execution output is captured; no direct data leaks or untrusted data sinks are apparent.",
  "flows": "If in a Git repository, executes 'git describe' to determine version; otherwise defaults to a static version string.",
  "anomalies": "Uses subprocess to run external 'git' commands, which could be manipulated if environment is compromised. However, this is standard for version retrieval in development environments.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and a specific library ('flet'). It determines version info either from a hardcoded string or by querying Git if available. The subprocess calls are standard for version control info retrieval and do not process untrusted data directly. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The use of subprocess is typical and limited to version info, not dangerous. The code structure is straightforward with no obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs version detection using standard methods and external processes without any malicious behavior. It does not contain malware or suspicious code; it is a legitimate utility for version management.",
