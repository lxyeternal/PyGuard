  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Assessment:** The code is solely import statements from 'flet.core', with no active logic, data handling, or external communication.  \n- **Malware & Security Risk:** The report assigns a malware score of 0 and a very low security risk (0.1). This is appropriate given the static nature of the code.  \n- **Conclusion:** The analysis is sound; no malicious activity is evident.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it emphasizes the static import statements, no execution, data flow, or suspicious behavior.  \n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Malware score is 0, security risk negligible. The confidence is high.  \n- **Conclusion:** Correct and reasonable.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Assessment:** Again, only import statements with no runtime logic or data flow.  \n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Malware score is 0, security risk minimal.  \n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Assessment:** Same pattern—just imports, no active code or data processing.  \n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Malware score is 0, security risk very low.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Assessment:** Same as above—pure imports, no suspicious activity.  \n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Malware score 0, security risk negligible.  \n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly identify that this code is purely import statements with no active logic, data flow, or execution. The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior. The security risks are very low, reflecting the static and benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Any anomalies or suspicious claims?**  \n  No. The reports are consistent and accurate. They do not overstate or understate the risk.\n\n- **Potential for higher risk scores?**  \n  No. Since the code is only import statements, there's no basis for assigning higher malware or security risk scores.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nGiven the extensive import list, the code appears to be a setup or configuration for a larger application, not malicious in itself. The high confidence scores and zero malware ratings are justified.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, just due to the large import scope, but no active risk)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is a comprehensive set of import statements from a UI framework, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The reports' evaluations are accurate and reasonable.",
