  "purpose": "The code consists solely of import statements from the 'flet.core' package, serving as setup or configuration for a larger application.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'flet.core' modules, which load various UI components, controls, and system utilities.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling; static imports only, no runtime data flow.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code is static and only imports modules.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected; the code is straightforward import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive list of import statements from a UI framework, with no executable logic, data processing, or network activity. All reports correctly identify this as benign static code. Malware scores are zero, and security risk scores are very low (around 0.1), reflecting the benign nature of static imports. Confidence levels are high (≥0.9), justified by the lack of runtime behavior or suspicious patterns. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely static import statements with no malicious activity or security concerns. All reports are accurate and consistent. The assigned malware score of 0 and security risk score near zero are appropriate. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
