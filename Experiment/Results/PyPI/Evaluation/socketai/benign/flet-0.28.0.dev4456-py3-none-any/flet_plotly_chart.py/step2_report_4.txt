  "review": "Let's analyze these reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \n   The code snippet is a simple import statement:\n   ```python\n   from flet.core.plotly_chart import PlotlyChart\n   ```\n   There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious constructs. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no anomalies or security risks in the import statement itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly state that this is a straightforward import with no malicious intent or security issues. No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n   - **Confidence**: Mostly 1, with some at 0.9, which seems reasonable given the simplicity of the code.  \n   - **Obfuscated**: All are 0, which is correct.  \n   - **Malware**: All are 0, aligning with the benign nature of the code.  \n   - **Security Risk**: Mostly 0, with one report at 0.1. Given the code snippet alone, this is appropriate.  \n   The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \n   None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.1, which is appropriate. The import statement alone does not pose a security risk.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \n   All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \n   All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they acknowledge that the import alone is benign and that further context would be needed to assess actual usage.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis. No discrepancies are evident.\n\n**Overall Assessment and Personal Estimation**:  \n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious behavior detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation)  \n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk from this import alone)  \n\nThis import statement is standard, safe, and does not pose any security threat.\n\n**Final note**: Since all reports are aligned and accurate, I concur with their assessments. No further action or heightened concern is necessary based solely on this code snippet.",
