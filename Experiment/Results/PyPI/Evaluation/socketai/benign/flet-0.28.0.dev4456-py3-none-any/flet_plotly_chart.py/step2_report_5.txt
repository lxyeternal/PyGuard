  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code snippet is a simple import statement:\n     ```python\n     from flet.core.plotly_chart import PlotlyChart\n     ```\n   - There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data leaks in this import statement alone.\n   - The code does not contain any executable logic, data handling, or external communication.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment that this is a benign import statement.\n   - No logical flaws or misconceptions are evident in the reasoning.\n   - The reports correctly note that without further context, the security implications are minimal.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - Security risk scores are also mostly 0 or very low (e.g., 0.1), aligning with the assessment that this code alone is not risky.\n   - Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is justified given the simplicity of the code.\n   - The obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores:**\n   - Since the code is only an import statement with no execution or data handling, higher risk scores are unwarranted.\n   - Any risk would depend on how `PlotlyChart` is used later, which is outside the scope of this snippet.\n\n5. **Malware and Suspicious Behavior:**\n   - No evidence suggests malicious intent.\n   - The package `flet` is a known library for building web and desktop apps, and importing a chart component is standard.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they only comment on the import statement itself.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis: all indicate low or no risk, no malware, and no obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Overall Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** **0** — The snippet alone does not pose a security risk.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- If further code showed how `PlotlyChart` is used, especially if it involves untrusted data or dynamic code execution, the risk assessment might change.\n- As it stands, the import statement is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, safe import statement with no malicious or security concerns based solely on this snippet. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware and risk, with high confidence in this assessment.",
