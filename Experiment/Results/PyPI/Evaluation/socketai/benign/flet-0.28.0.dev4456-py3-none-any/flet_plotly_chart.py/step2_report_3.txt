  "review": "Let's analyze these reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple import statement: `from flet.core.plotly_chart import PlotlyChart`.\n   - There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities in this snippet.\n   - The code is benign and standard for importing a class from an external library.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the import statement alone does not pose security risks.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the summaries.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n   - Security risk scores are mostly 0 or very low (0.1), which seems reasonable given the context.\n   - Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), reflecting certainty that the code is safe.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, appropriate for such straightforward import statements.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - No issues here; all scores are appropriately low or zero.\n   - Since the code is only an import statement with no execution or data handling, high risk scores are unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n   - No signs of malicious activity are present or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that the import alone is harmless.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis; no discrepancies are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:**  \n- Based solely on this import statement, the malware score should remain **0**.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:**  \n- The code is clear and straightforward; obfuscation score should be **0**.\n\n**Risk Score:**  \n- Since the code is a benign import, the overall security risk should be **0** or very close to it.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n| Metric             | Suggested Score | Justification                                                  |\n|--------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0                 | No malicious behavior detected or implied.                       |\n| Obfuscated         | 0                 | Clear, standard import statement.                                |\n| Security Risk      | 0                 | No vulnerabilities or security issues present in this snippet.  |\n\n**Final note:**  \nThis import statement is a standard, safe operation. No changes are necessary, and the current scores are appropriate.",
