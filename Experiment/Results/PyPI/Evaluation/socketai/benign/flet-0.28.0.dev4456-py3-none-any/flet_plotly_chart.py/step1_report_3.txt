  "purpose": "Import the PlotlyChart class from the flet.core.plotly_chart module, likely for displaying or rendering Plotly charts within an application.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the 'flet.core.plotly_chart' module from the package or environment dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present in this snippet; potential misuse would depend on how 'PlotlyChart' is used later in the code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this snippet only contains an import statement without further code to analyze data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious patterns observed in this isolated import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a class from a module within the 'flet' package, which appears to be a legitimate library for UI and chart rendering. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks in this import alone. No input data or external data flows are present, and no sensitive data handling is visible.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a straightforward import statement for a plotting component from a known library. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security issues based solely on this import. Further context would be needed to assess usage, but the import itself is benign.",
