  "purpose": "Import the PlotlyChart class from the flet.core.plotly_chart module for use in plotting or charting functionalities.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external data sources are involved in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the import simply makes a class available for use elsewhere, with no execution or data transfer in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward import statement with no obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a basic import statement importing PlotlyChart from the specified module. All reviews correctly identify this as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned (malware: 0, risk: 0, obfuscated: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The import does not involve data processing, external communication, or executable logic that could pose security risks. Given the simplicity and clarity, the code is safe, and the scores reflect this.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is harmless and poses no security threat. All reports are accurate and consistent, and no adjustments to scores are necessary.",
