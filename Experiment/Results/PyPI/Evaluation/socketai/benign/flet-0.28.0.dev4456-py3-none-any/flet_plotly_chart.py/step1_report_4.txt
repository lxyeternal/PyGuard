  "purpose": "Import the PlotlyChart class from the flet.core.plotly_chart module, likely for visualizing data using Plotly within a Flet application.",
  "sources": "Import statement that loads a class from an external package",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data handling in this snippet; potential use of imported class depends on subsequent code",
  "flows": "Import flows from external module to local namespace; no data flow or execution flow evident in this single line",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns in this isolated import statement",
  "analysis": "This is a straightforward import statement bringing in a plotting component from a third-party library. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data leakage, or backdoors in this line. Since it's only an import, it does not execute code or perform any operations that could be malicious. No obfuscation, unusual syntax, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import statement for a plotting class from a third-party library. There is no evidence of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation in this line. The snippet alone appears safe.",
