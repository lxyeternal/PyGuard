  "purpose": "The code imports the PlotlyChart class from the flet.core.plotly_chart module, likely for displaying or manipulating Plotly charts within a Flet application.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from the package 'flet.core.plotly_chart'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code snippet; it only performs an import.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows, inputs, or outputs beyond the import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement of a class from a module. No input handling, no data processing, and no untrusted data sources are present. The imported class may be used later in the application, but that is not shown here. No malicious or suspicious behavior can be inferred from this single line.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard import statement for a plotting component used in a GUI or web application. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks based on this minimal code snippet.",
