      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured application bootstrap for the Flet framework. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The use of environment variables and dynamic imports is standard practice. The overall security risk is low, with a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a minor risk score of approximately 0.2 due to environmental configuration reliance."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate asyncio socket server component with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or payloads. The security risk is low but could be increased by adding authentication or encryption. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score should be around 0.2–0.3 due to missing security measures, which is consistent with the reports. Overall, the code appears benign and well-structured."
