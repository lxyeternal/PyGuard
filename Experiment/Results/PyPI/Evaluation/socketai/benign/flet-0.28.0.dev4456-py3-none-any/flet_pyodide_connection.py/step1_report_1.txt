{
  "purpose": "Implements a WebSocket-like connection for Pyodide environment, handling message exchange and session management between client and server.",
  "sources": "Reads incoming messages from JavaScript via 'send_from_js' and JSON-decoded message data in '__on_message'.",
  "sinks": "Sends messages back via 'send_callback' which calls 'self.__send', that serializes messages with json.dumps.",
  "flows": "Incoming JavaScript messages → '__on_message' parsing → triggers event handlers or responses → '__send' serializing and sending data back.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. No obfuscation present. No unusual or malicious behavior apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily establishes a communication channel using asyncio queues and JSON serialization. It handles known message types and passes control to user-defined callbacks. There are no signs of data exfiltration, malicious command execution, or network connections beyond message passing within the web environment. The message processing appears standard, with proper use of asyncio tasks. No suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a WebSocket-like interface for a Pyodide environment, with no malicious or maliciously intended behavior detected. It securely manages message exchange and session handling without apparent security issues.",
