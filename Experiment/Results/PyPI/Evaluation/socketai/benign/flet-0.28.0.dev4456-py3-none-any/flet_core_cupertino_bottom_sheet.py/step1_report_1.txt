{
  "purpose": "Defines a Cupertino-style modal bottom sheet control class with properties and methods for UI behavior.",
  "sources": "Initialization parameters, property setters/getters, internal method calls (_set_attr, _get_attr, _set_enum_attr, etc.).",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data; no network calls, no file operations, no command execution.",
  "flows": "Data flows from property setters to internal attribute methods; no flow leading to data leakage or command execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Usage of external controls and event handlers appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a UI control class with properties for visual and behavioral attributes. It interacts with internal attribute management methods but does not handle untrusted external input beyond property assignments. No network, file, or system command operations are present. There are no signs of malicious logic, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors. The class appears to be a straightforward UI component definition.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard UI component class with no malicious or suspicious elements detected. It functions to define a Cupertino-style bottom sheet control, with no evidence of malware or security risks.",
