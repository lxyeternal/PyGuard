  "purpose": "Defines a Cupertino-style modal bottom sheet control for a GUI framework, allowing configuration of appearance and behavior.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for class initialization, property setters, and event handler assignment methods.",
  "targets": "Internal attribute setters and event handler registration methods.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are stored via setters; internal attributes are used for rendering and event handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns identified. No external data or untrusted sources are involved.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for a UI component, mainly involving property setters/getters and control initialization. There are no external data sources, network operations, or data leaks. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior detected. The class uses standard patterns for GUI control definition, event handling, and attribute management. The code appears straightforward, with no signs of supply chain attack vectors or malware-like behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard UI control class with no malicious intent or security risks. It manages control attributes and event handlers securely. No vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are evident.",
