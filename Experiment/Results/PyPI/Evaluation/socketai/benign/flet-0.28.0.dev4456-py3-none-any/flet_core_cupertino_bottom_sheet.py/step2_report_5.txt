  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n\n- Defines a UI control class `CupertinoBottomSheet`.\n- Uses standard property setters/getters, internal attribute management, and event handling.\n- No network, file, or command execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns.\n- No external data sources or sinks handling untrusted input.\n- The code appears to be a straightforward UI component implementation.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of each report:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Defines a UI control class.\n- Findings: No suspicious sinks, flows, anomalies.\n- Conclusion: No malicious or security risks.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Risk: 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The code is benign, and the low risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar to Report 1, defining a UI control.\n- Findings: No untrusted data handling, network calls, or malicious code.\n- Conclusion: No signs of malicious behavior.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Risk: 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code remains benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Defines a UI control with event handling.\n- Findings: Accepts external input in properties and event handlers, but no malicious intent.\n- Conclusion: No malicious behavior or supply chain issues.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score, but justified given that properties accept external input, which could be misused if the application mishandles event handlers or properties. Still, no evidence of malicious code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Similar to previous, UI control class.\n- Findings: No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code.\n- Conclusion: No vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n- Confidence: 0.95\n- Malware: 0\n- Risk: 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Defines a GUI control with properties and event handling.\n- Findings: No external data sinks, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation.\n- Conclusion: No malicious behavior.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports are 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), justified by external property inputs and event handlers, but no actual malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **My final expert estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0.05** — Very low, as the code is a standard UI component with configurable properties, and no external untrusted data handling or network operations.\n\n**In conclusion,** the code is a standard UI control class with no security risks or malicious intent. The scores in the reports are reasonable, and I would not suggest significant changes.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always consider the context in which this code is integrated. If the larger application processes untrusted data or executes event handlers that could be malicious, the overall risk could increase. But based solely on this snippet, the security posture is very low risk.",
