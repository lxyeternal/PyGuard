  "purpose": "Defines a Cupertino-styled modal bottom sheet control for a UI framework.",
  "sources": "Imports from flet.core.control, flet.core.ref, and flet.core.types; class attributes; property setters and getters; constructor parameters.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly. No untrusted data handling, network calls, or sensitive data processing observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow to external systems or untrusted sinks. Properties are set and retrieved internally or via attribute setters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures detected. The code appears to be a standard UI component implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a UI control class with properties, getters, and setters, primarily managing visual and behavioral attributes. There are no external data inputs or outputs, nor any code that executes untrusted code, handles sensitive data insecurely, or performs network operations. The structure follows typical object-oriented patterns for UI components. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are evident. The code seems to be a benign, standard component definition.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate UI component definition with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain suspicious behaviors or malicious code segments.",
