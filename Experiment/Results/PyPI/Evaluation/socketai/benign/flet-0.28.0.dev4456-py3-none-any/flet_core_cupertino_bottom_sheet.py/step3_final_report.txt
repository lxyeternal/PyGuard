{
  "purpose": "Defines a Cupertino-style modal bottom sheet UI control with configurable properties and event handling.",
  "sources": "Property setters (bgcolor, height, padding), event handler registration (on_dismiss)",
  "sinks": "Event handler invocation, property assignment",
  "flows": "External property inputs to internal attributes and event handler calls",
  "anomalies": "Accepts external input for properties and event handlers but does not process maliciously; no suspicious code patterns or data flows",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward UI component class managing properties and events without network, file, or command execution. External inputs are handled via setters but not executed or transmitted maliciously. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The minimal external data handling does not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard UI control with no malicious or security vulnerabilities. The low malware score (0) and obfuscation score (0) are appropriate. The slight risk score (~0.05-0.1) reflects external property inputs but does not indicate an actual threat.",
