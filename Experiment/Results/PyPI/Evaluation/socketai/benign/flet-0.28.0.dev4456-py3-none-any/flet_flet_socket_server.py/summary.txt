  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate asyncio socket server component with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or payloads. The security risk is low but could be increased by adding authentication or encryption. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score should be around 0.2–0.3 due to missing security measures, which is consistent with the reports. Overall, the code appears benign and well-structured."
