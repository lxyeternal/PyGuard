  "purpose": "Define a customizable 'Chip' UI control for a Python GUI framework, allowing for interaction, styling, and event handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'flet.core' modules, class constructor parameters, property setters, event handler registration methods.",
  "sinks": "Event handler assignments, attribute settings, and JSON attribute serialization methods.",
  "flows": "Initialization of properties -> setting attributes and event handlers -> registration of event handlers for user interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network connections, or malicious code patterns detected. Usage of event handler registration is standard. No signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious system commands.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a UI component with numerous configurable properties, event handlers, and styling options. It includes standard patterns for event registration, property getters/setters, and attribute serialization. No indication of code injection, data leaks, or malicious behavior. The code is well-structured, modular, and appears to be part of a UI library for creating interactive components. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate UI control definition without malicious intent. It facilitates customization and event handling for a GUI component. No malicious behavior, security risks, or malicious code patterns are detected.",
