{
  "purpose": "Defines a 'Chip' UI control class for a Python GUI framework, allowing customization and event handling of chip elements.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'flet.core' modules, control constructor parameters, property setters, and event handler assignments.",
  "sinks": "Event handlers (on_click, on_delete, on_select, on_focus, on_blur) and attribute setters that could potentially trigger malicious code execution if handlers are malicious.",
  "flows": "Input data through constructor parameters and property setters flows into event handler assignments and attribute settings, which are invoked during control interactions and updates.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears standard for a GUI control class; no suspicious hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are evident. Event handler mechanisms are typical but could be exploited if handlers are maliciously assigned externally.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a GUI component with multiple configurable properties and event handlers. No external inputs or data processing are present that could be exploited; event handlers are stored and invoked as callbacks. The import statements are standard and do not exhibit malicious patterns. There is no evidence of backdoors, malicious network activity, or hidden functionalities. The code structure is typical for a control class in a GUI framework, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate GUI control class with standard property management and event handling. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. The main security consideration is ensuring that externally assigned event handlers are trusted, but the code itself is benign.",
