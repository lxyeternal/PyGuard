  "purpose": "This code defines a customizable 'Chip' UI control for a Python UI framework, allowing configuration of visual appearance and event handling.",
  "sources": "Code reads control properties, event handlers, and optional parameters during initialization and property accessors.",
  "sinks": "Event handlers (on_click, on_delete, on_select, on_focus, on_blur) may execute user-provided functions; control attributes could influence UI rendering.",
  "flows": "Control property setters assign user-defined functions to event handler attributes; event triggers could invoke these handlers; control properties set visual and behavioral attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, network connections, or suspicious code behaviors detected. Use of optional event handlers and attribute setters is standard; no evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a class definition for a UI component with configurable properties and event handlers. It employs standard patterns for property getters and setters, and event registration. No code injection, network activity, or obfuscated code is present. No malicious or sabotage indicators are detected. The use of dynamic event handlers and property attributes is typical for UI controls.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a standard UI control implementation without malicious intent or security risks. It allows for customization and event handling typical of UI frameworks, with no signs of supply chain attacks or sabotage.",
