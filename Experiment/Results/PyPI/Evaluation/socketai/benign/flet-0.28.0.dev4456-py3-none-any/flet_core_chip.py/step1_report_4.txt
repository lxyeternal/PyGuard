{
  "purpose": "The code defines a customizable UI control component called 'Chip' for a Python GUI framework, including properties, initialization, and event handling.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include user-defined parameters for properties, external references like 'flet.core' modules, and event handler assignments.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include event handler functions (on_click, on_delete, etc.) that could execute arbitrary code, and attributes that may influence UI behavior.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor parameters to internal properties, which may trigger event handlers or influence UI rendering; user-defined event handlers are stored and invoked externally.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are observed. The code strictly manages UI control properties and event handling. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a class definition for a UI component with properties, getters, setters, and event handler management. It relies on external 'flet.core' modules. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network connections, data exfiltration, or code injection. Event handlers are user-defined and stored for later invocation, which is standard. No suspicious patterns or anomalies detected. The code appears to be a legitimate component implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured UI control class with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It handles user interactions and property management as expected, with no suspicious behavior.",
