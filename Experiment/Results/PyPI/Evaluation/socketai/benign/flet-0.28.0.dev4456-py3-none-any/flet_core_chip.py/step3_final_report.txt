  "purpose": "Defines a customizable UI control (Chip) with properties, styling, and event handlers for a Python framework.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters, property setters, event handler registration methods, attribute serialization functions.",
  "sinks": "Event handler callbacks, attribute setting functions, URL launch method (page.launch_url).",
  "flows": "External data or user interaction triggers event handlers; attribute setters update internal state; event handlers may execute user-defined code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, network activity, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard UI component class with properties, event registration, and attribute management. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Event handlers are user-defined callbacks, which is typical in UI frameworks. The URL launch is benign in context. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's structure and potential external handler risks. No evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities is found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured UI control class with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The potential risk is limited to external handler trust, which is inherent in callback-based UI components. The security assessment and scores are appropriate and justified.",
