  "purpose": "Import all contents from the 'bleach_allowlist' module",
  "sources": "The import statement indicates reading the module 'bleach_allowlist'",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; potential data flow depends on imported module usage elsewhere",
  "flows": "Not applicable here; import statement alone does not establish data flow",
  "anomalies": "Use of a wildcard import ('*') can obscure which components are imported, possibly hiding malicious code or unwanted behavior",
  "analysis": "The code only contains a single import statement using a wildcard, which can lead to importing unintended or malicious code if 'bleach_allowlist' contains malicious content. The import itself is a standard Python operation, but the lack of specificity ('*') makes code review more difficult and could hide malicious components. No other code present to evaluate for malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal, performing only a wildcard import. While this practice can be risky due to potential hidden malicious imports within 'bleach_allowlist', there is no explicit malicious behavior in this snippet alone. However, the use of wildcard imports should be scrutinized further in the context of the entire project.",
