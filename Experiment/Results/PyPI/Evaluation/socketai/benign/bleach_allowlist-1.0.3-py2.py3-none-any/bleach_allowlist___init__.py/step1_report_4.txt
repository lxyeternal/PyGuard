  "purpose": "Import all contents from the module bleach_allowlist, likely for sanitization or filtering purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local package bleach_allowlist",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or external output operations observed",
  "flows": "Data flow is limited to importing definitions; no runtime data flow or untrusted input handling present",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import can obscure which specific elements are imported; no explicit malicious code or secrets detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement from a local module, possibly for use in sanitization or whitelisting. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident from this line alone. The presence of a wildcard import is generally discouraged but does not indicate malicious intent. No external data handling, network operations, or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import statement with no indications of malicious behavior or security issues. The use of wildcard import is a style concern but not a security risk.",
