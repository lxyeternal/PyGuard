{
  "purpose": "Import all contents from the local module 'bleach_allowlist' to include its definitions in the current namespace.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only imports a module without executing or processing data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or runtime behaviors; the import simply loads the module.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*'), which can obscure imported identifiers and potentially hide malicious code if the module is compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no embedded malicious code or obfuscation. The primary concern is the wildcard import, which is a style and maintainability issue rather than a security breach. The content of 'bleach_allowlist' is unknown, so potential maliciousness depends on that module's contents. The malware score is zero, consistent with the benign appearance. The security risk score is low (around 0.1 to 0.2), reflecting the style concern but no actual malicious activity. The confidence in this assessment is high (0.9), given the simplicity of the code and absence of suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The main issue is the use of wildcard import, which is a style concern rather than a security threat. Scores should remain at malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk around 0.1 to 0.2, acknowledging the import style but not indicating a security risk.",
