{
  "purpose": "Import all contents from the 'bleach_allowlist' module, likely to use predefined allowlisted elements for sanitization or filtering.",
  "sources": "The import statement indicates reliance on external code within the 'bleach_allowlist' module.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no data is processed or output within this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow observed within this code snippet; the flow depends on subsequent usage of imported elements.",
  "anomalies": "Single-line import statement; no suspicious or unusual code structure. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports all contents from a module named 'bleach_allowlist'. This is a standard import statement and does not by itself introduce malicious behavior. The safety depends on the contents of the imported module, which are not visible here. There is no code execution, data handling, or network activity demonstrated. The code snippet is minimal and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The snippet is straightforward and typical for modular Python code. No anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.",
