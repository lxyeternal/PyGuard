  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The main issue is the use of wildcard import, which is a style concern rather than a security threat. Scores should remain at malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk around 0.1 to 0.2, acknowledging the import style but not indicating a security risk."
