  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the evidence, reasoning, and scoring:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports are based solely on a single import statement: `from .bleach_allowlist import *`.\n- The code is minimal, with no runtime behavior, data flow, or external interactions.\n- The primary concern raised is the use of a wildcard import (`*`), which can obscure what is imported and potentially hide malicious code if the module is compromised.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Assessment:** No malicious code or obfuscation detected.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score = 0, risk = 0.1 (low, as it's a benign import).\n- **Verdict:** Valid, the code appears safe.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Assessment:** Highlights the risk of wildcard import hiding malicious components.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score = 0, but securityRisk is 0.3 due to the potential for hidden malicious imports.\n- **Verdict:** The reasoning is sound; the use of `*` warrants caution but does not indicate malicious code outright.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Assessment:** No anomalies or malicious behavior; straightforward import.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.\n- **Verdict:** Correct; the code is benign.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous; use of wildcard import noted as style concern but not malicious.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.2 (due to import style).\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious activity; depends on contents of the imported module.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1.\n- **Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of scoring consistency:\n- All reports correctly identify that the import statement itself is benign.\n- The primary concern is the use of `*`, which can obscure malicious components if the module is compromised.\n- Malware scores are all zero, which aligns with the evidence.\n- Security risk scores vary but are generally low, reflecting the minimal code shown.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.3 (mostly style and maintainability concerns, not security threats)\n\nGiven the minimal code and the nature of the reports, I would assign the following scores:\n\n**My estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to wildcard import style, not a security issue)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The import statement itself is benign, but the use of wildcard import should be flagged as a style concern rather than a security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Since the code snippet is just an import statement, there is no evidence of malicious activity. The focus should be on coding practices rather than security vulnerabilities in this isolated case.",
