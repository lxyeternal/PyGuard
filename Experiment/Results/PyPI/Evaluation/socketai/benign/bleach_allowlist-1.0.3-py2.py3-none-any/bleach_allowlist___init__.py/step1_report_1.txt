  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the module 'bleach_allowlist', likely to define or manage a whitelist for sanitization or filtering purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement accessing the 'bleach_allowlist' module.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data output points are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow is explicitly visible in this snippet; it only performs an import.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a relative import; no evidence of malicious code or obfuscation. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single import statement using a relative import to include all contents from 'bleach_allowlist'. This suggests modular code organization, possibly related to sanitization or filtering. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious activities. The absence of additional code limits the ability to assess further potential risks.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet is a straightforward import statement with no indication of malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be part of a normal codebase setup, focusing on importing a specific whitelist module.",
