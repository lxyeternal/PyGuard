{
  "purpose": "Import all contents from the 'bleach_allowlist' module, likely to configure or extend sanitization rules or whitelist configurations.",
  "sources": "The code imports from the module '.bleach_allowlist' which is a local package or module within the same package hierarchy.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling is present in this single line of import statement.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows in this minimal code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a simple import statement; no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs an import operation from a relative module. It does not contain any logic, data handling, or external interactions. Since it is a straightforward import statement, it does not pose any security risk or malicious behavior. The import could be part of a larger codebase that manages sanitization whitelists, but alone, it is benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement with no malicious intent or security issues. It is a standard module import that does not pose any threat.",
