  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the details provided and applying critical reasoning.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a single import statement: `from .bleach_allowlist import *`\n- The main concern raised across some reports is the use of a wildcard import (`*`), which can obscure what is imported and potentially hide malicious code.\n- No actual malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are evident in the code snippets themselves.\n- The risk scores assigned are mostly low, with some variation based on the perceived risk of wildcard imports.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the presence of issues in the code:\n- The code is a straightforward import statement.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data leaks are present.\n- The only potential concern is the use of `import *`, which can be risky in larger codebases due to namespace pollution and difficulty in auditing.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n- **Overemphasis on wildcard import risk:** While `import *` can be problematic, in this context, it doesn't automatically imply malicious intent. The reports appropriately note this but sometimes imply it could hide malicious code, which isn't necessarily true without further context.\n- **Lack of context:** The reports don't analyze the contents of `bleach_allowlist`. The actual risk depends heavily on what that module contains.\n- **No mention of code review or validation of `bleach_allowlist`:** Without inspecting the module, it's impossible to determine if it contains malicious code or not.\n\n### Score assessments:\n- The **malware scores** are all zero, which aligns with the code snippet's benign appearance.\n- The **security risk scores** vary from 0.1 to 0.3, which seems reasonable given the minimal code but acknowledges the wildcard import concern.\n- The **obfuscated scores** are zero, correctly indicating no obfuscation detected.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.3, which seems appropriate.\n- Given the minimal code and lack of malicious indicators, a higher score isn't justified.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are generally consistent with the analysis, emphasizing that the code itself is benign but noting the potential risks of wildcard imports.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.3 (due to the wildcard import practice, but no actual security issue)\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The import statement itself is not malicious but should be reviewed in the context of the entire codebase.\n- Prefer explicit imports to improve code clarity and security posture.\n- Verify the contents of `bleach_allowlist` to ensure it doesn't contain malicious code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Estimate |\n|-----------------|----------------|\n| Malware         | 0              |\n| Obfuscated      | 0              |\n| Security Risk   | 0.1 - 0.2      |\n\nThe current reports are reasonable, but the actual risk depends on the contents of `bleach_allowlist`, which isn't provided here. Without evidence of malicious code, the import statement itself remains benign.",
