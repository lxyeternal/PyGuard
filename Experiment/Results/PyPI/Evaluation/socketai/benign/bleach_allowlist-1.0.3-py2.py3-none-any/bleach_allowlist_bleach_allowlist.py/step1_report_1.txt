{
  "purpose": "Definition and categorization of HTML tags, CSS styles, and related attributes for safe and unsafe web content rendering and sanitization.",
  "sources": "Lists of HTML tags, CSS styles, and prefixes, along with categorization logic. No input or data reading mechanisms are present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data handling points. The code purely defines static data structures for categorization.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink since the code is only static definitions and list manipulations without dynamic or input-driven logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual behaviors. The code is purely static, defining lists and sets for web security categorization purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code contains static lists categorizing HTML tags, CSS styles, and prefixes as safe or unsafe for XSS and markup integrity. It also defines styles compatible with markdown and print rendering. No functions, input handling, or data processing are present. There are no dynamic behaviors, obfuscated patterns, or code execution constructs. The absence of input/output or execution logic indicates that this is configuration data rather than executable or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a static configuration module defining categorization for HTML tags and CSS styles to aid in sanitization or rendering decisions. There is no malicious intent, behavior, or data manipulation present. It appears to be a standard security-related static list used for content filtering or validation.",
