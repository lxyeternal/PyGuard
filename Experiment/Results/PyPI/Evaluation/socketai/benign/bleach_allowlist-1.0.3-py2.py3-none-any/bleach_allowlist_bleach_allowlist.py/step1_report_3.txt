{
  "purpose": "Definition and categorization of HTML tags, CSS styles, and attributes for safe rendering, XSS prevention, and formatting purposes.",
  "sources": "The code sources include static lists of HTML tags, CSS styles, attribute names, and style prefixes, defined explicitly within the code.",
  "sinks": "The lists themselves serve as reference data; no active data sinks or untrusted data processing are present in the code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks, as the code only contains static data definitions and categorization.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution, are present. The lists are static and explicitly defined.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of predefined static lists categorizing HTML tags, styles, and attributes for security and rendering purposes. It distinguishes between XSS-safe and unsafe tags, and defines CSS styles with vendor prefixes. The code appears to be designed for input validation, sanitization, or rendering contexts, with no active or executable logic, data processing, or network interactions. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. The only potential concern is the inclusion of tags that could be used maliciously if improperly used elsewhere, but as a static reference, it is not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static data configuration defining HTML tags, CSS styles, and attributes for rendering and security purposes. It does not contain any executable or malicious behavior and appears safe. No evidence of malware, malicious activity, or security risks is found.",
