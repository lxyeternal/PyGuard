  "purpose": "The code defines lists and sets of HTML tags, CSS styles, and prefixes related to web development, primarily for sanitization, rendering, and security considerations in HTML/CSS content handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data from predefined lists and dictionaries, including tags, style properties, and CSS prefixes.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks or data processing functions; the code does not perform any data output, network communication, or execution based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "The code does not include any runtime data flows, input handling, or processing logic; it merely establishes static lists for later use.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious code behaviors, or hidden functionalities. The lists seem comprehensive and consistent with standard web security practices.",
  "analysis": "The code provides curated lists of HTML tags and CSS styles, including unsafe tags that could open XSS vulnerabilities if used improperly. It categorizes tags as unsafe or safe and prepares style property lists with vendor prefixes. No functions, input processing, or dynamic code execution is present. It appears to be part of a sanitization or content filtering system for web content, with no evidence of malicious intent or harmful behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static configuration of web tags and styles for sanitization purposes, with no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It does not perform any runtime operations, data handling, or network communication. Overall, it appears safe and intended for security-aware content filtering.",
