  "purpose": "Definition and categorization of HTML tags, CSS styles, and attribute lists for safe rendering, security assessment, and documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "Static data structures including lists and dictionaries defining HTML tags, unsafe tags, safe tags, markdown tags, print tags, and CSS styles with prefixes.",
  "sinks": "No active sinks or data processing functions; only static data definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flows or execution flows present; the code is purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors; the code consists entirely of static lists and dictionaries used for validation or filtering purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines static lists and dictionaries categorizing HTML tags and CSS styles, including dangerous tags that could open XSS vulnerabilities if improperly used. There are no functions, data processing, or dynamic behaviors present. No hardcoded secrets, network activities, or malicious code snippets are present. The categorization appears intended for sanitization or filtering logic in larger systems. The code is well-structured, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a reference or utility data for HTML/CSS sanitization. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks within this code segment.",
