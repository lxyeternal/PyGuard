  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The report correctly states that the code is static data defining lists for sanitization, with no dynamic or malicious behavior.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None. The reasoning is sound; the code is configuration data.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. These are reasonable given the static nature.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate. No concerns here.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues present?** No. It also recognizes the code as static lists for sanitization with no runtime processing.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None. The reasoning is consistent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1. The small securityRisk score reflects the potential danger if these tags are misused, but since it's static data, this is acceptable.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly identifies the code as safe configuration data.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Similar to others, it describes static lists for sanitization and categorization.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None. The reasoning is appropriate.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. No issues.\n- **Conclusion:** Well-founded.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues present?** No. It emphasizes the static, declarative nature of the code.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Perfectly aligned.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues present?** No. It correctly states that the code is static data for sanitization, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Again, appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, consistent with the static, clear data definitions.\n- **Risk score:** Very low (0 or 0.1), reflecting the potential danger if these lists are misused, but since the code itself is static and non-executable, this is reasonable.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- **No dynamic or executable code is present.** The code is purely static data, serving as configuration for sanitization or rendering logic.\n- **No obfuscation or malicious patterns** are detected.\n- **Scores are appropriate** given the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to account for potential misuse if these lists are used improperly in a larger system, but the code itself remains safe)\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a benign static configuration module with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk inherent in the code itself.",
