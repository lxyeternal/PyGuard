  "purpose": "Static configuration data defining HTML tags, CSS styles, and prefixes for sanitization and rendering safety categorization.",
  "sources": "Lists and dictionaries that specify safe and unsafe HTML tags, CSS styles, and vendor prefixes.",
  "sinks": "Not applicable; the code does not process untrusted data or perform I/O operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static data used for reference in sanitization processes.",
  "anomalies": "Minor typo in 'detals' instead of 'details'; no security impact.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static lists and dictionaries used for categorizing HTML tags and CSS styles for security purposes. No functions, data processing, or dynamic code execution are present. The categorization aligns with best practices for preventing XSS and other injection attacks. The presence of tags like <script>, <iframe>, and <object> in the unsafe list is appropriate. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the static, benign nature of the data. The only minor issue is a typo ('detals' instead of 'details'), which does not affect security but should be corrected for accuracy.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static, well-structured configuration module for sanitization purposes, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The assigned scores are appropriate, and the overall security risk is negligible. The only recommendation is to fix the typo in the 'all_tags' list.",
