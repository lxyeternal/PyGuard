  "conclusion": "The code is a static, well-structured configuration module for sanitization purposes, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The assigned scores are appropriate, and the overall security risk is negligible. The only recommendation is to fix the typo in the 'all_tags' list."
