  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the static nature of the code, the categorization logic, and the potential security implications.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- The code is purely static data: lists and dictionaries defining HTML tags, CSS styles, and prefixes.\n- No functions, input/output processing, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The categorization aligns with standard security practices for sanitization and rendering.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious code are evident.\n- The lists include known unsafe tags (e.g., `<script>`, `<iframe>`, `<object>`, `<embed>`, `<video>`, `<xmp>`, etc.) appropriately flagged as unsafe for XSS.\n- The CSS styles include vendor prefixes and extensive properties, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious styling.\n\n**Specific Points:**\n- The reports correctly identify the code as static configuration data.\n- They recognize that the code does not process data or perform any malicious activity.\n- The categorization of tags into safe/unsafe and styles with vendor prefixes is consistent with best practices.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are detected.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the static, benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk Score:** Since the code is static configuration data with no active behavior, a low risk score (~0.1) or 0 is justified. Some reports assign 0, others 0.1, which is acceptable.\n- **Confidence Levels:** All are high (1.0 or 0.9), consistent with the static, well-understood data.\n\n**Potential Concerns:**\n- The only minimal concern could be the inclusion of certain tags like `<script>`, `<iframe>`, `<object>`, which are rightly flagged as unsafe. However, their presence in the unsafe list is intentional and standard.\n- The CSS styles are extensive but are standard CSS properties and vendor prefixes, not obfuscated or malicious.\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n- The code is a static, well-structured configuration module for sanitization purposes.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**My Personal Estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (or possibly 0.1 if considering minimal inherent risk due to unsafe tags, but given static data, 0 is more appropriate)\n\n**Final Note:**\nThis code appears to be a standard security configuration list, not an incident or malicious payload. The reports are accurate in their assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- Confirmed: No malicious code, obfuscation, or active data processing.\n- Scores: Appropriately assigned, with no need for adjustment.\n- Overall security risk: Very low to none.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a more detailed review of specific parts or further analysis.",
