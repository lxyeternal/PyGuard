  "purpose": "Define and categorize HTML tags, CSS styles, and attributes for sanitization, security, and rendering purposes.",
  "sources": "Static lists of tags, styles, and attributes; no dynamic data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code does not process or output untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only initializes data structures without runtime data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or dynamic execution; code is straightforward data initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains static lists of HTML tags, CSS styles, and attributes, categorized for different purposes such as XSS mitigation, markdown rendering, and print formatting. No functions, input handling, or runtime operations are present. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or system modifications are observed. The lists are comprehensive and appear intended for sanitization or validation in a larger system. The code is clean, well-structured, and does not exhibit malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely declarative, establishing data categories for HTML and CSS sanitization or formatting, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a configuration or reference data module.",
