{
  "purpose": "The code provides visualization functions for decision boundaries of classifiers, supporting both univariate and bivariate cases, including plotting grids, class predictions, probabilities, and instance markers.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from variables X and y, and model predictions via predict_proba or predict methods.",
  "sinks": "Uses matplotlib to generate plots; no direct data leakage or network operations detected.",
  "flows": "Input data X/y are used to generate prediction probabilities and class labels, which then inform visualizations. No untrusted data flows into sensitive operations outside plotting.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures identified. No evidence of obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or misleading variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily for plotting decision boundaries and instance distributions in classification tasks. It relies on standard libraries like matplotlib, numpy, pandas, and PIL. The functions perform data range calculations, generate grids, predict class probabilities, and visualize class regions, boundaries, and points. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. Color adjustments and legend functions are used for clarity. The use of model.predict or predict_proba is standard for classifier evaluation, with no signs of malicious manipulation. There are no hidden or encrypted segments, and the code structure is straightforward, focusing solely on visualization tasks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate visualization utility for classifier decision boundaries, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It employs standard practices for plotting and prediction. The overall security risk is negligible.",
