  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent visualization utility for classifier decision boundaries. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The scores are consistent with its benign nature, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1). It is safe for use in ML visualization tasks."
