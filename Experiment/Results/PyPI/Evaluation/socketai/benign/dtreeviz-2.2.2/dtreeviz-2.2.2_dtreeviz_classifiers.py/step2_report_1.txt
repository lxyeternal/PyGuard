  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the key aspects: presence of malicious code, logical flaws, scoring consistency, and justification for risk levels.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a visualization utility for decision boundaries, using standard libraries and straightforward logic. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis; no malicious activity identified.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — very low, consistent with the benign assessment.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's reasoning is sound; the code appears safe and standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard visualization of decision boundaries with no suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0 — appropriate, given the benign nature.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reasoning is consistent; no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on visualization functions with standard prediction calls, no suspicious activity.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis; no malicious activity.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0 — appropriate.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's assessment is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a benign visualization utility with standard operations.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious code.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0 — consistent with the benign assessment.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reasoning is valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—standard visualization code, no suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malware detected.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0 — appropriate.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's evaluation appears accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Presence of issues in code:** No. All reports correctly identify this as visualization code relying on standard ML prediction methods, with no malicious or obfuscated code.\n\n- **Scores consistency:** All malware scores are 0, matching the analysis. Risk scores are very low (0.1 or 0), which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n- **Potential concerns:** No evidence of supply chain attack vectors, backdoors, or malicious code snippets.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected or suggested.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** — very minimal, possibly accounting for the fact that this code could be integrated into larger systems, but no real security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The provided reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard visualization utility with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores reflect this appropriately.",
