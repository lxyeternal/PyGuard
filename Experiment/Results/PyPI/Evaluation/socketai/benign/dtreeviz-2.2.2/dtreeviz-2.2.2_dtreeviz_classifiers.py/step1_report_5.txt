{
  "purpose": "The code provides visualization functions for decision boundaries and class probabilities for machine learning models, supporting both 1D and 2D feature spaces.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from numpy arrays or pandas DataFrames/Series, and model predictions via predict() and predict_proba() methods.",
  "sinks": "The code visualizes data by plotting scatter points, decision boundaries, and probability grids using matplotlib. No data is sent over the network or stored externally.",
  "flows": "Input data (X, y) are processed to generate grids of predictions and probabilities, which are then visualized through various plotting functions; data visualization and model prediction calls are source-to-sink flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code uses standard libraries and straightforward logic. No suspicious data handling or hidden operations are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs visualization tasks for ML decision boundaries, relying on model prediction methods. It contains standard plotting procedures, input validation, and color adjustments. No parts suggest malicious intent. All functions serve legitimate visualization purposes without performing any harmful operations or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign visualization utility for machine learning models, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It strictly visualizes model predictions and probabilities, and does not perform network operations or data theft.",
