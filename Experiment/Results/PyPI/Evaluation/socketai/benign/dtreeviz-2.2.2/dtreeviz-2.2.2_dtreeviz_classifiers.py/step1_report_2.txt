{
  "purpose": "The code provides visualization functions for decision boundaries in classification models, supporting both 1D and 2D feature spaces. It helps visualize model predictions, probabilities, and misclassifications on plots.",
  "sources": "The code reads input features X and target labels y, and model outputs via predict_proba() or predict(). It also reads parameters for plot customization and data ranges.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs visual plots via matplotlib; no data is sent over the network or stored maliciously. No file writes, network calls, or system modifications are detected.",
  "flows": "Input data (X, y, model) -> computation of probabilities/predictions -> creation of visual elements (tiles, boundaries, markers) -> plotting on matplotlib axes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs. The code uses standard visualization libraries and straightforward control flow.",
  "analysis": "The code implements data validation, model compatibility checks, and plotting routines for classifier decision boundaries. It creates grid overlays for visualization, computes class probabilities, and plots instance points with options for misclassification highlighting. All operations are standard for visualization tasks. No external data leaks, network activity, or system modifications are present. The functions rely on standard libraries and perform expected visualization logic without obfuscation or hidden actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate visualization utility for decision boundaries in classification tasks. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. It performs data processing and plotting safely and transparently.",
