{
  "purpose": "The code provides visualization functions for decision boundaries in classification tasks, supporting both univariate and bivariate data, by plotting grids, class probabilities, boundaries, and data points.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from X and y, and model predictions via predict_proba or predict methods.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; primarily visual output to matplotlib axes.",
  "flows": "Source data (X, y) -> model prediction methods -> grid computations -> plotting functions -> visual display.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard libraries (matplotlib, numpy, pandas, PIL) and standard model prediction calls. It creates grids over feature space, computes probabilities and predictions, and plots decision regions, boundaries, and data points. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or external data exfiltration. The functions are well-structured for visualization purposes, with no suspicious logic or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent visualization utility for classifier decision boundaries. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The scores are consistent with its benign nature, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1). It is safe for use in ML visualization tasks.",
