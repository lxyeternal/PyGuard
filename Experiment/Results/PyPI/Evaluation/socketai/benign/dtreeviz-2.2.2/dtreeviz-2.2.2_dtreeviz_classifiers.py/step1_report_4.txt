{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for visualizing decision boundaries and class predictions for 1D or 2D classifiers, supporting both binary and multi-class models, using matplotlib for plotting.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input arrays or DataFrames (X, y), and model predictions via predict_proba and predict methods, as well as data ranges for plotting.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that could cause data leaks or malicious actions; plotting functions only generate visualizations, and model prediction methods are called with trusted data inputs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input variables (X, y) into model prediction calls (predict_proba, predict), then into color and boundary rendering functions, and finally visualized via matplotlib axes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious data handling are observed. The code strictly performs data visualization, with no signs of data exfiltration or backdoors. The use of randomness in univariate plots is benign for visual variation.",
  "analysis": "The code thoroughly handles input data from pandas or numpy, performs standard model prediction calls, and generates plots accordingly. It includes necessary error checks for model method implementations and data shapes. No obfuscated or suspicious code constructs are present. The functions are focused on visualization without any network, file, or system manipulation beyond plotting. The color adjustments and plotting routines are standard and do not introduce security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard visualization utility for decision boundary plotting with no malicious intent. It operates solely on provided data and model predictions to generate visual insights. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or supply chain attacks are evident.",
