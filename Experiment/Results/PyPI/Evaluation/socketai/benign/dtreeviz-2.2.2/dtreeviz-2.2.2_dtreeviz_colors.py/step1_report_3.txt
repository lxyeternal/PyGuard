{
  "purpose": "Define color schemes, color mappings, and color generation functions for data visualization in Python, likely for plotting libraries such as matplotlib.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted input sources are present; the code only uses static definitions and matplotlib functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "The only flow involves generating color lists via matplotlib colormaps, which is a standard, safe operation. No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. The functions are straightforward with no obfuscation or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines color constants, lists of colors for different classes, and a function to generate hex colors from matplotlib colormaps. It uses standard library functions without user input or external data. The get_hex_colors function creates color lists based on the colormap and number of classes, defaulting to 'RdYlBu'. The adjust_colors function updates the color scheme with generated colors if needed. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It performs typical visualization setup tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe and intended for setting up color schemes for visualizations. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. All functions rely on standard matplotlib functionality and static data.",
