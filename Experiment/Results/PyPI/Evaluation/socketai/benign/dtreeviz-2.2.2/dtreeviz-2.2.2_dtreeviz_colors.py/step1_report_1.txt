{
  "purpose": "The code provides color schemes, color generation functions, and color adjustment utilities for visualizations, likely used in a data visualization context.",
  "sources": "Imports 'matplotlib' and 'numpy', and uses functions like 'matplotlib.cm.get_cmap' and 'matplotlib.colors.to_hex' to generate color lists based on colormaps.",
  "sinks": "The 'matplotlib.cm.get_cmap' and 'matplotlib.colors.to_hex' functions are used to generate and convert colormap data; no data sinks or outputs that process untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "The 'get_hex_colors' function takes 'n_classes' and optionally 'cmap_name' to generate hex color lists from colormaps; these are stored in variables and returned but not sent elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. No network operations, file manipulations, or system commands are present. Usage of color palettes and matplotlib functions are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines color constants and functions for color generation and management for visualization purposes. It uses 'matplotlib' colormaps to generate color schemes, with fallback to predefined color lists for specific class counts. There is no evidence of malicious logic, data exfiltration, or harmful behavior. The functions are straightforward, and their operations are limited to generating color lists for visualization.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and intended for visualization color management. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The functions are well-defined, use standard libraries, and do not perform any suspicious operations.",
