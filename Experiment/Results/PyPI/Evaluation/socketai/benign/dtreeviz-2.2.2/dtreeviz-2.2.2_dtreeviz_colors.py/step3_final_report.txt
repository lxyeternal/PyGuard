{
  "purpose": "Provides color schemes, palette generation functions, and utilities for visualization purposes, primarily using matplotlib and numpy.",
  "sources": "Matplotlib colormaps and numpy for color conversions; static color constants.",
  "sinks": "None; functions generate color lists internally without external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Functions produce color lists based on parameters; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines color constants and functions for generating color palettes using standard libraries. It performs straightforward operations without external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. All components are typical for visualization utilities. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for managing visualization colors, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified and consistent with the code's purpose.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
