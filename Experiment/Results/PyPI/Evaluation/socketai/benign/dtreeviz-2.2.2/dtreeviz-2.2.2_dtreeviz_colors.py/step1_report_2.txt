{
  "purpose": "The code provides color schemes and utility functions for generating color palettes for data visualization, especially for classifiers with varying number of classes.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or untrusted data; it relies solely on predefined constants and matplotlib's colormap functionalities.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or outputs where untrusted data could leak or be exploited; the functions return color lists or dictionaries without side effects.",
  "flows": "The main flow involves generating color palettes based on class counts using matplotlib colormaps, with no data transmission or external interaction.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors are present. The color generation functions are standard utility functions. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines static color constants and color schemes, and a function get_hex_colors that generates color palettes from matplotlib colormaps for a given number of classes. It uses standard matplotlib APIs, with no dynamic code execution or data manipulation that could be malicious. The adjust_colors function conditionally extends color schemes based on class count, again using safe, standard practices. Overall, the code appears to be purely for visualization purposes, with no malicious intent or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for color palette management in visualization tasks. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code is well-structured and uses standard libraries without suspicious modifications.",
