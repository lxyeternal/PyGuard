{
  "purpose": "This code defines color schemes and functions for generating color palettes for data visualization, likely as part of a larger visualization or machine learning project.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads untrusted input or external data sources; it primarily relies on internal constants and library functions.",
  "sinks": "The code calls matplotlib's colormap functions and converts colormap outputs to hex colors, but these are safe operations; no sinks that handle untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "No external data flows are established; color generation functions produce color lists based on parameters and internal constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are detected. The code is straightforward and mainly defines constants and helper functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports well-known libraries (matplotlib, numpy) for color processing. It defines several color schemes and a function get_hex_colors to generate color palettes from colormaps, as well as an adjust_colors function to select or extend color schemes based on class count. There are no dynamic or unsafe operations, no data leaks, no network operations, and no code obfuscation. The logic appears to be standard for visualization purposes with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for color configuration and palette generation for visualization purposes. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, and no malicious code. It appears safe and standard for its purpose.",
