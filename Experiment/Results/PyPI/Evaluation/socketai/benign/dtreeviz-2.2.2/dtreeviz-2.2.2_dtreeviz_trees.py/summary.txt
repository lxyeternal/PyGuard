  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign visualization library for decision trees. It poses no malicious threat or sabotage. The low security risk scores are justified, and malware scores should remain at zero. The main security consideration is ensuring filename inputs are sanitized if user-controlled, but as provided, the code is safe."
