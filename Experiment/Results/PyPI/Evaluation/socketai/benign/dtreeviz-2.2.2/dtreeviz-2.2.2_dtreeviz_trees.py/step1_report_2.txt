{
  "purpose": "The code provides a visualization interface for decision tree models, including functions to display leaf sizes, class distributions, prediction paths, feature spaces, and more, for models supported via ShadowDecTree.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the model's training data (X_train, y_train), feature names, and specific instance vectors x. Data is also obtained from internal shadow_tree methods and from temporary files for embedded images.",
  "sinks": "Generated images and HTML-like embedded SVGs are written to temporary files. Plot objects are saved as image files in temporary directories. No external network connections or data exfiltration mechanisms are observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input features and training data into shadow_tree methods, which produce statistical summaries or visual representations. These summaries are rendered as plots or embedded images, stored locally in temp files. No untrusted data is used to influence system commands or network communications.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code features are detected. The code heavily relies on standard plotting libraries, temporary files, and matplotlib routines, which are typical for visualization purposes. No suspicious dynamic code execution or system manipulation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is structured around visualization functions for decision tree models, with data read from the model and training dataset, and output saved as images or HTML snippets. It uses temporary file storage for SVG images and relies on standard Python packages. There are no indications of data exfiltration, network communications, or malicious payloads. Functions appear to be designed solely for model interpretability and visualization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign visualization utility for decision trees, with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It performs standard data visualization and file handling tasks without external network activity or malicious behavior. Therefore, it can be considered safe from a supply chain security perspective.",
