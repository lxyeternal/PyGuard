  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and the reasonableness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a visualization library for decision trees, reading data from model objects and user inputs, generating images and SVGs, with no external command execution or code injection.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis; no malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code appears straightforward, no obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — low, justified by the fact that it handles user data (e.g., 'x') and writes files locally, but no malicious activity.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are reasonable. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing visualization functions, standard plotting, and local file creation, with no network activity or code injection.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code straightforward, no obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, justified by standard visualization tasks.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a visualization utility for decision trees, generating images and diagrams, with no external network or code execution.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no signs of malicious payloads.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is standard, no obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — minimal, consistent with the description.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on visualization, no network or code injection, uses standard libraries, writes files locally.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — low, justified.\n\n**Conclusion:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar, with emphasis on visualization routines, no suspicious external operations.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — straightforward code.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — low, justified; potential concern only if filenames are externally controlled, but no indication of such.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's behavior. No signs of malicious payloads, obfuscation, or external command execution.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, matching the code's transparency.\n\n- **Risk Scores:** Very low, justified by the code's nature as a visualization library that handles data and files in a standard manner, with no external network activity or code injection.\n\n### Final Estimations:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — confirmed across all reports, no malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear, no obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Given the low scores assigned and the code's straightforward behavior, I would estimate a **risk score around 0.1** to **0.2** overall, considering the potential for external filename control but no active malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports' scores are consistent with the code's behavior. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The low risk scores are justified. I agree with the assessments and would suggest a **malware score of 0**, **obfuscated score of 0**, and a **risk score around 0.1–0.2**.",
