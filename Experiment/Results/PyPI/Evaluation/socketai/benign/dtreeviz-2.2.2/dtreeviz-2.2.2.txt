      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate set of visualization utilities for decision trees and SVG processing. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain attacks are evident. The low malware (0), obfuscated (0), and risk (0.2) scores are justified given the context. The external command usage is typical for such tools and does not pose significant security concerns when inputs are trusted. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use in trusted environments, with minimal security risk."

The low security risk scores are justified, and malware scores should remain at zero. The main security consideration is ensuring filename inputs are sanitized if user-controlled, but as provided, the code is safe."

It contains no malicious or obfuscated code, with data flow limited to internal operations. Scores are consistent with this assessment, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low security risk (~0.1), mainly due to deprecation warnings. Overall, it is safe for supply chain use."
