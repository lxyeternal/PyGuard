  "purpose": "Utility functions for SVG manipulation, decision tree visualization, and pipeline feature extraction.",
  "sources": "File I/O for SVG files, reading SVG references, external 'dot' command invocation.",
  "sinks": "Writing SVG output files, invoking external commands with SVG filenames.",
  "flows": "SVG files are read, processed (including inlining images and scaling), and written; external commands generate and process SVG files.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'os.getpid()' for filenames, no validation of SVG files, external command execution without input sanitization, no backdoors or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles SVG processing, visualization, and pipeline feature extraction. It invokes external tools like graphviz for rendering, which is standard for such utilities. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. File operations are straightforward, and the external command calls are typical for rendering purposes. The SVG manipulation functions are safe assuming trusted inputs. No network activity or secret handling is observed. The use of 'os.getpid()' for temporary filenames is standard but could be improved with more secure temporary file handling. Overall, the code is well-structured, clear, and performs expected visualization tasks without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate set of visualization utilities for decision trees and SVG processing. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain attacks are evident. The low malware (0), obfuscated (0), and risk (0.2) scores are justified given the context. The external command usage is typical for such tools and does not pose significant security concerns when inputs are trusted. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use in trusted environments, with minimal security risk.",
