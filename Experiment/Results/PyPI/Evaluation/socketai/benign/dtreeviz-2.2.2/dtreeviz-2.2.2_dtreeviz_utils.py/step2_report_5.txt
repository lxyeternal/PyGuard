  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, reasoning, and scoring consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is mainly utility functions for SVG manipulation and decision tree visualization. No malicious activity or backdoors are detected. The confidence is high (0.9), and malware/obfuscated scores are zero.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code review. The functions are standard, and no suspicious logic is evident. The low security risk score (0.2) is reasonable.\n\n- **Recommendation:** No change needed. The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing SVG processing, file operations, and external command calls. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected. Confidence is high (0.9), malware score is zero.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly notes the standard nature of the code and the controlled external command execution. The minor concern about file handling is typical and not malicious.\n\n- **Recommendation:** No change needed. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on SVG manipulation, decision tree visualization, and file I/O. No malicious behavior or backdoors found. Confidence is high, malware score is zero.\n\n- **Assessment:** The review correctly identifies that the code operates in a typical manner for visualization utilities, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n- **Recommendation:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with emphasis on SVG processing, external command execution, and file I/O. No malicious activity detected. Confidence is high, malware score is zero.\n\n- **Assessment:** The review is consistent and thorough. The use of external commands is standard, and no suspicious patterns are present.\n\n- **Recommendation:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, focusing on utility functions for SVG and decision tree visualization. No malicious behavior or backdoors. Confidence is high, malware score is zero.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent and reasonable.\n\n- **Recommendation:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusion:\n\nAll reports agree that the code is a legitimate utility library for SVG manipulation and decision tree visualization, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the findings.\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious payloads or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — minor risks related to external command execution and file handling, but nothing severe.\n\n**Final justification:** The code performs standard visualization tasks with controlled external command usage and no suspicious patterns. The low risk score reflects minimal concern, primarily about external command calls which are typical in such utilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2  \n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus among the reports.",
