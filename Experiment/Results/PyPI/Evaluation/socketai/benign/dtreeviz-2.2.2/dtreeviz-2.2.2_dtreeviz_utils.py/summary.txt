  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate set of visualization utilities for decision trees and SVG processing. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain attacks are evident. The low malware (0), obfuscated (0), and risk (0.2) scores are justified given the context. The external command usage is typical for such tools and does not pose significant security concerns when inputs are trusted. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use in trusted environments, with minimal security risk."
