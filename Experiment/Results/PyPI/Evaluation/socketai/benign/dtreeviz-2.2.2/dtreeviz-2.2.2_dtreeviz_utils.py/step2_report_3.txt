  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and determine appropriate scores and insights.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on SVG manipulation, inline images, and pipeline feature extraction. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Findings:** Reads SVG files, processes them, no suspicious logic, no backdoors, no obfuscated code.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 (low), Confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report's reasoning aligns with the code. The code handles SVG files and visualization utilities without any malicious logic. External commands (graphviz) are standard and controlled. No signs of malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n- Scores are reasonable.  \n- No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing SVG processing, file I/O, and external command calls.\n- **Findings:** File reading/writing, external 'dot' command execution, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2, Confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with the code. The use of subprocess calls for graphviz is standard for visualization, assuming trusted inputs. No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n- Scores are appropriate.  \n- No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focused on SVG rendering, manipulation, and decision tree visualization utilities.\n- **Findings:** File I/O, external commands, no hardcoded secrets or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2, Confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nMatches the code's behavior. No malicious patterns or obfuscation detected. External command usage is typical for such visualization tools.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n- Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar focus on SVG processing, decision tree visualization, file operations.\n- **Findings:** File read/write, external 'dot' command, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2, Confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with the code. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n- Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for SVG and decision tree visualization, standard file I/O, external command execution.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns, no backdoors, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2, Confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe code appears benign. External commands are standard, no malicious data handling.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n- Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports consistently indicate no malicious activity, which aligns with the code's content.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Given the code's functionality (SVG processing, external command execution), a low but non-zero risk score (0.2) is reasonable, mainly due to reliance on external tools and file handling.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** — minimal, typical for visualization utilities that invoke external tools and handle files.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a legitimate utility for SVG and decision tree visualization with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The low risk score reflects the minimal security concern inherent in such visualization tools when used in trusted environments.",
