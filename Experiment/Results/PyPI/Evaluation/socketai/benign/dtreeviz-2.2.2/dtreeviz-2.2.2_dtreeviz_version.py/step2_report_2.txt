  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a license header and version variable assignment.\n- The code is static, contains no executable logic, input/output, or external data processing.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are noted.\n- The license is the standard MIT License, and the version string is a common practice.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code snippets are purely metadata: license comment and version string.\n- No data flows, no external interactions, no embedded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- All reports agree on benign nature, with confidence level 1.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n- No technical inaccuracies or logical flaws are evident.\n- The reasoning is consistent and well-supported by the code's simplicity.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- Malware: 0 in all reports, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- Obfuscated: 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- Security risk: 0, appropriate given the absence of executable code or data processing.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n- The reports are comprehensive and consistent; no adjustments needed.\n- No suspicious assumptions or overlooked vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- Malware score: 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- Obfuscated score: 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- Risk score: 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Final notes:**\n- The reports are accurate and thorough.\n- No further action required; the code is safe and standard for open-source projects.\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign, with appropriate scoring. No anomalies, threats, or suspicious patterns are present.",
