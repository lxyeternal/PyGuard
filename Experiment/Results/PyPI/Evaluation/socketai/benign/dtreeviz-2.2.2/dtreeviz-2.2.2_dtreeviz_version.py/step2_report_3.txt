  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code snippet carefully.\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:\n   - The code is purely a license comment block (MIT License) and a version string assignment (`__version__ = '2.2.2'`).\n   - There is no executable code, input/output handling, or dynamic behavior.\n   - No embedded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n2. **Assessment of Report Validity**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, consisting solely of license and version information.\n   - They uniformly state there are no anomalies, no data flows, and no malicious activity.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation**:\n   - The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The obfuscated scores are 0, which is accurate.\n   - The security risk scores are 0, consistent with the absence of any security issues.\n\n4. **Justification for Scores**:\n   - Since the code contains no executable logic, no external data handling, and no suspicious patterns, the risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.\n   - The reports' assessments are aligned with the code content.\n\n5. **Potential Issues or Assumptions**:\n   - The reports assume that license headers and version strings are inherently safe, which is generally correct.\n   - No assumptions about hidden malicious behavior are justified here, as the code is straightforward.\n\n6. **Overall Conclusion**:\n   - The code is entirely benign.\n   - The scores given in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code content.\n   - No modifications to the scores are necessary.\n\n**Final Estimate**:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis provided.",
