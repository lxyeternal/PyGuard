  "purpose": "This code serves as a license header and defines the version of the software package.",
  "sources": "The static license comment block and the assignment of __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or untrusted data flows; the code contains only static metadata.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists; the code is purely static with no runtime data movement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a license comment and a version string assignment, with no executable logic or external dependencies. All reports correctly identify this as benign metadata. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified given the static, standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only license and version information. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The current assessments and scores are accurate and do not require adjustment.",
  "confidence": 1,
