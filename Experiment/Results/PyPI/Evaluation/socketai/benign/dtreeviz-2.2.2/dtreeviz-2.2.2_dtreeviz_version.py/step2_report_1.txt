  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior:**\n   - All reports describe the code as a license header with a version string (`__version__ = '2.2.2'`).\n   - The code contains no executable logic, no input/output handling, no data flow, and no external dependencies.\n   - The license text is standard MIT License, which is common and benign.\n   - The version string is a static assignment, typical for package metadata.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Elements:**\n   - No evidence of obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious patterns.\n   - No suspicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n   - The reports consistently confirm benign intent and behavior.\n\n3. **Errors or Flaws in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify the code as non-executable, metadata, and license information.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence level is 1, which is justified due to the straightforward, standard content.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - Since the code is purely static metadata, there is no reason to assign any risk higher than 0.\n   - The malware score is correctly 0; no malicious activity is detected.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - The security risk is 0, as expected.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - The only possible concern could be if this code was embedded in a larger context that performs malicious actions, but based solely on this snippet, there's no indication of that.\n   - The reports are thorough and accurate.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe current scoring appears entirely appropriate given the content. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nI concur with the reports' assessments. The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores reflect this accurately.",
