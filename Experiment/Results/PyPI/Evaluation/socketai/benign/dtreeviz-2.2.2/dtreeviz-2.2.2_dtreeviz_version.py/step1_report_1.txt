  "purpose": "License and version information for the software, providing legal permissions and version tracking.",
  "sources": "The license text itself, and the version string '__version__'.",
  "targets": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static license and version info.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; static data remains unchanged.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of only license text and version string; no code execution, no embedded secrets or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a license agreement and a version variable. It contains no executable code, input/output handling, or logic that could pose security risks. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or data exfiltration. The license is standard MIT License language, and the version string is a typical metadata assignment. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting only of license information and a version variable. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected.",
