  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the dtreeviz Python package, including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Imports setuptools and find_packages; data in setup() arguments including package info, dependencies, and metadata.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data handling or external input processing.",
  "flows": "N/A; setup script primarily static configuration without data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration using setuptools. It defines package metadata, dependencies, optional extras, and author info. No code executes external commands, network calls, or manipulates environment variables. No obfuscated code, malicious imports, or suspicious logic detected. The dependencies are typical for a machine learning visualization library. All code appears to serve its intended purpose without hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate.",
