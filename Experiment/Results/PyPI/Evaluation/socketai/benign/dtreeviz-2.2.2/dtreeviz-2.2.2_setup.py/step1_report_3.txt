  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the dtreeviz Python package, including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Code reads package dependencies, metadata, and comments from the setup script.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or inputs are present; the code is standard setup configuration.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input to critical functions; mostly static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are present. No obfuscated or suspicious code features.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py configuration for a Python package. It specifies dependencies, package metadata, and optional extras. All dependencies are standard packages, and there are no code injection points, network operations, or sensitive data handling. The comments and structure follow conventional setup patterns. No anomalies or malicious constructs are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
