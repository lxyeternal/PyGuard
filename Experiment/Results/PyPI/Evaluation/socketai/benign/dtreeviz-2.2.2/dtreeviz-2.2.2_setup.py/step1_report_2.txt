  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for packaging the dtreeviz Python library including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Import statements for setuptools, find_packages, and static configuration data within the setup() function.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable points include package dependencies and author contact info, but none pose direct security threats in this context.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows detected; static setup configuration is used to prepare a package for distribution.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated segments present. The code is standard for Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports only stable setup tools modules, defines static package dependencies, and includes no dynamic execution, external input processing, or code that could be exploited. The dependencies are standard, and the author information is static. No suspicious behavior or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python library. It contains no malicious behavior, no backdoors, and no security risks. It is safe and standard for open-source Python projects.",
