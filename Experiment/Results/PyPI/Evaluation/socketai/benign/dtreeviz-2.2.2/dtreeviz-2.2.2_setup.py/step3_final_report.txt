{
  "purpose": "This setup.py script defines the packaging configuration for the 'dtreeviz' Python library, including dependencies, metadata, and optional extras.",
  "sources": "Static strings defining dependencies, package metadata, author info, and comments; no external input or dynamic code.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external command execution present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code follows standard packaging conventions with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup script using setuptools to define package info and dependencies. No dynamic code execution, external data sources, or network operations are present. Dependencies are fixed strings, and the code structure is typical for Python package configuration. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The assigned scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python setup script with no malicious intent or security concerns. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and justified.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
