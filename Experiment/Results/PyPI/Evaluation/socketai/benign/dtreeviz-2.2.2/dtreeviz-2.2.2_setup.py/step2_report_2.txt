  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports consistently identify the code as a standard setup.py configuration script.\n- No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are noted.\n- Dependencies are static strings, and no dynamic code execution or external data sources are involved.\n- Author contact info and metadata are benign.\n- No code that could execute external commands, handle untrusted input, or leak sensitive data.\n\n**Malware and Obfuscated Scores:**\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which is appropriate given the evidence.\n- No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n**Security Risk Scores:**\n- All reports assign a security risk of 0, which is justified.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- The reports are thorough and consistent, and the code is straightforward.\n- No discrepancies or questionable claims are present.\n- The dependency lists are standard and do not include any known malicious packages.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a typical, benign setup.py script with no malicious or security concerns.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks in this setup script.",
