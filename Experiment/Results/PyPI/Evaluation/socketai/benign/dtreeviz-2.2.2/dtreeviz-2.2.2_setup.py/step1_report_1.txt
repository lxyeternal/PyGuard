{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the dtreeviz Python package, facilitating installation and dependency management.",
  "sources": "Reading package dependencies from 'install_requires' and 'extras_require'; reading package metadata such as name, version, URL, author info, description, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data influences sensitive operations or leaks; no code executing external commands or handling untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; dependency lists are static strings defined in code.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs observed; standard setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py configuration script used for packaging a Python library. It defines package metadata, dependencies, optional features, and classifiers. All dependencies are static strings, with no dynamic code execution, user input, or external data sources. The script is typical for Python packaging and does not include any suspicious or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a normal setup configuration file for a Python package without malicious intent or security risks. No signs of malware, obfuscated code, or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
