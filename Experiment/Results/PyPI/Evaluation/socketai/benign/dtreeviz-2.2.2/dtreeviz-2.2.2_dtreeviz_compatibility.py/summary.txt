  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as backward-compatible visualization wrappers for decision trees. It contains no malicious or obfuscated code, with data flow limited to internal operations. Scores are consistent with this assessment, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low security risk (~0.1), mainly due to deprecation warnings. Overall, it is safe for supply chain use."
