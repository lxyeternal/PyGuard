{
  "purpose": "This code provides various visualization functions for decision trees, including deprecated functions that support backward compatibility and new visualization methods using shadow trees and model API classes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data input parameters such as X_train, y_train, feature_names, target_name, class_names, and tree_model from function arguments. It also accesses shadow tree data via ShadowDecTree.get_shadow_tree and internal model methods.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include calls to model methods such as rtree_feature_space, ctree_feature_space, view, leaf_sizes, leaf_purity, leaf_distributions, node_stats, instance_feature_importance, and explain_prediction_path, which may process or visualize data based on untrusted input parameters.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input (e.g., X_train, y_train, feature_names, class_names, tree_model, node_id, x) is used to generate shadow trees, which are then passed into internal model methods for visualization or data analysis. These methods could process or display sensitive data or internal statistics depending on the inputs.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains extensive use of warnings.warn with deprecated function notices, indicating legacy support. There are no suspicious hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors. No unusual or obfuscated language features are present. All data inputs are from function parameters. The reliance on internal model methods appears standard for visualization purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily serves as a wrapper around internal visualization APIs and deprecated functions, with deprecation warnings guiding users to newer interfaces. It consistently obtains shadow trees from the ShadowDecTree class and then invokes visualization or data description methods from the DTreeVizAPI class. The functions accept various data inputs and parameters to produce visualizations or node statistics. There are no signs of malicious code such as network calls, file operations, reverse shells, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The only notable aspect is the use of warnings for deprecated functions, which is a standard practice for maintaining backward compatibility. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate visualization module without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of deprecated and current visualization functions for decision trees, wrapping internal APIs and shadow trees. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. Its purpose is to facilitate visualization and interpretation of decision trees. The presence of deprecation warnings indicates maintenance effort, not malicious activity.",
