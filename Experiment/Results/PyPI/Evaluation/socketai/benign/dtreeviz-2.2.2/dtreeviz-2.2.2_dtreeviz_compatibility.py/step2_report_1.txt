  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's behavior, data flow, and potential security implications.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code primarily serves as a wrapper around internal visualization and interpretation APIs for decision trees.\n- It issues deprecation warnings to guide users toward newer APIs.\n- It constructs shadow trees from models and datasets, then calls visualization or analysis methods.\n- There are no signs of malicious code such as network activity, file operations, code injection, or data exfiltration.\n- The data flow is confined within in-memory operations, mainly involving passing data structures to visualization classes.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are present.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Correctly identifies that the code is mainly deprecated wrapper functions for visualization.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** Data flows from function parameters into shadow trees and visualization methods. No external data leaks or malicious sinks.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior; standard use of warnings and API calls.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate visualization code with no malicious intent.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (minor, due to deprecation warnings, but not a security concern)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues found.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above—deprecated visualization functions for backward compatibility.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** Data flows are internal, with no external transmission.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious operations; only deprecation warnings.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, maintains backward compatibility.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above—visualization and interpretation wrappers.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** No external side effects; only visualization API calls.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior; standard deprecation warnings.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, benign code.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Same purpose—visualization wrappers with deprecation notices.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** No external data leaks or harmful operations.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity; just API wrappers and warnings.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard for visualization modules.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above—deprecated functions for visualization and interpretation.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** No external communication or file operations.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior; only warnings and API calls.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, with no security risks.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (very low, mainly due to deprecation warnings)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final thoughts:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as the code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code, a low risk score (~0.1 to 0.2) is appropriate, mainly due to deprecation warnings and maintenance practices, not security issues.\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, related to deprecation warnings and maintenance, not security risk)\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a set of deprecated wrapper functions for decision tree visualization, issuing warnings to guide users to newer APIs. It processes data and models internally without external communication or side effects. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The code is safe in the context of supply chain security. The low risk score reflects its benign nature, primarily involving deprecation notices and API forwarding.",
