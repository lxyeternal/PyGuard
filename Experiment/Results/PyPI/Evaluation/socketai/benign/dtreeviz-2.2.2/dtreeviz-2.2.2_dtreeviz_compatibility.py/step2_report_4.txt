  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code wraps visualization functions, mainly deprecated ones, using shadow trees and internal APIs.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Calls to visualization methods and warnings.warn() with no external data transmission.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Functions are wrappers, issuing deprecation warnings, and internally calling visualization APIs. No malicious behaviors such as network activity, file operations, or code injection are present.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate visualization module with backward compatibility support, not malicious.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Security Risk:** 0.2 (low, due to deprecation warnings and potential misuse if warnings are ignored, but not a direct risk)  \n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is deprecated wrappers issuing warnings, redirecting to newer APIs.\n- No suspicious external activity or malicious code.\n- Data flow is confined within in-memory operations, mainly involving shadow trees and visualization APIs.\n- No signs of backdoors or malicious intent.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Security Risk:** 0 (minimal, standard deprecation handling)\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Focuses on the wrapper nature, deprecation warnings, and internal API calls.\n- No network, file, or malicious behavior detected.\n- Well-structured, mainly issuing warnings and redirecting to visualization methods.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Security Risk:** 0 (safe, standard practice)\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Similar to previous, emphasizing that the code is mainly wrapper functions with deprecation warnings.\n- No malicious activity or suspicious patterns.\n- Data flows are within in-memory structures and API calls.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Security Risk:** 0 (safe)\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Reinforces that the code is deprecated wrappers for visualization, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- No external network, file operations, or code execution.\n- Focused on backward compatibility and visualization.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Security Risk:** 0.1 (very low, mainly due to deprecation warnings, not malicious)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of all reports:**\n\n- **Malware:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** All report 0, no obfuscation observed.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low, primarily due to deprecation warnings and wrapper functions, not actual security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n- The code is a set of wrapper functions for decision tree visualization, including deprecated functions that maintain backward compatibility.\n- It relies on internal modules (`ShadowDecTree`, `DTreeVizAPI`) and issues deprecation warnings guiding users to newer APIs.\n- No evidence of malicious activity such as network calls, data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors.\n- The overall security posture appears benign.\n\n---\n\n### **My expert estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1 to 0.2** (negligible, mainly due to deprecation warnings, which are standard maintenance practices)\n\n**Note:** These scores reflect the code's apparent purpose and behavior based on the provided snippets and analysis. It appears safe for supply chain use, assuming the underlying modules (`ShadowDecTree`, `DTreeVizAPI`) are also secure and trustworthy.\n\n---\n\n**Final conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, well-structured visualization utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The deprecation warnings are standard for maintaining backward compatibility, not indicators of malicious activity.",
