  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's behavior, data flow, and potential security implications.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports identify the code as primarily a set of wrapper functions around internal visualization APIs and deprecated functions.\n- The code issues deprecation warnings to guide users toward newer APIs, which is standard practice.\n- The functions obtain shadow trees from `ShadowDecTree.get_shadow_tree()` and then invoke methods from `DTreeVizAPI`.\n- Inputs include datasets, model objects, feature names, class labels, and visualization parameters.\n- No external network calls, file I/O, or system modifications are present.\n- The code does not perform any code execution, dynamic imports, or obfuscated operations.\n- There are no hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors.\n\n**Malware and security risk assessment:**\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- Security risk scores are low (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting the lack of external side effects or insecure operations.\n- The extensive use of warnings for deprecation is standard and does not introduce security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Potential vulnerabilities or concerns:**\n- Since the code relies on external modules (`ShadowDecTree`, `DTreeVizAPI`) and user-provided data, the security of the overall system depends on those components.\n- If `ShadowDecTree.get_shadow_tree()` or the visualization methods process untrusted data insecurely, that could be a concern, but based on the code, these are internal calls with controlled data flow.\n- No evidence of code injection, command execution, or data exfiltration.\n\n**Consistency of scores:**\n- Malware: 0 across all reports, consistent with the analysis.\n- Obfuscated: 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- Security risk: Very low, given the nature of the code.\n\n**Summary of individual reports:**\n- All reports correctly identify the code as a benign, backward-compatibility wrapper for visualization functions.\n- They correctly note the absence of malicious behavior and the standard use of warnings.\n- The confidence levels are high (0.9 to 0.95), which is justified.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0** — no malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration present.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** **0** — clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.\n\n**Risk score:** **0.1** — minimal, primarily due to the potential for misuse if external modules or data are compromised, but no direct vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n**Malware justification:** The code is purely for visualization and interpretation, with no signs of malicious payloads.\n\n**Obfuscation justification:** The code is readable and straightforward.\n\n**Risk justification:** As a wrapper for visualization, the main concern would be the security of the underlying modules and data, but the code itself does not introduce risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final conclusion:\n- The code is a benign, well-structured set of deprecated and current visualization functions for decision trees.\n- No malicious or obfuscated code is present.\n- The scores should remain as originally indicated: **malware = 0**, **obfuscated = 0**, **risk = 0.1**.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a detailed breakdown per specific function or further analysis.",
