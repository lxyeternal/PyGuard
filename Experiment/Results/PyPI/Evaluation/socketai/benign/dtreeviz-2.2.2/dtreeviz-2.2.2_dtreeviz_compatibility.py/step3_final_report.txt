{
  "purpose": "The code provides deprecated wrapper functions for decision tree visualization and interpretation, issuing warnings to guide users toward newer APIs. It constructs shadow trees from models and datasets, then calls visualization or analysis methods, primarily for backward compatibility.",
  "sources": "Function parameters including models, datasets (X_train, y_train), feature names, class labels, and node IDs; internal calls to ShadowDecTree.get_shadow_tree() and DTreeVizAPI methods.",
  "sinks": "In-memory data passing to visualization APIs; no external network, file I/O, or code execution observed.",
  "flows": "User inputs → shadow tree creation → visualization or analysis method calls → visual output or data summaries.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external communication; standard deprecation warnings.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of wrapper functions for decision tree visualization, mainly deprecated, issuing warnings and forwarding parameters to internal visualization classes. It processes data internally without external side effects, network activity, or malicious code. No signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads are present. The data flow is confined within in-memory structures, and the code relies on trusted internal modules. The deprecation warnings are standard and do not introduce security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as backward-compatible visualization wrappers for decision trees. It contains no malicious or obfuscated code, with data flow limited to internal operations. Scores are consistent with this assessment, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low security risk (~0.1), mainly due to deprecation warnings. Overall, it is safe for supply chain use.",
