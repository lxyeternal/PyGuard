{
  "purpose": "This code imports various modules and functions from the 'dtreeviz' package, which appears to be a visualization library for decision trees and classifiers.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's own '__version__' attribute and imports specific functions and classes from internal submodules of 'dtreeviz'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input sources or data sinks are present; the code does not process external input or output sensitive data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sinks within this code snippet; it solely performs static imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscated code are evident. The import statements are straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, including a commented-out section for a new API. It imports version info and various visualization functions and classes from submodules. There is no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing observed. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present in these static import statements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module import setup for a visualization library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be legitimate setup code for a package's internal API or user-facing API.",
