{
  "purpose": "This code imports various functions and classes from the 'dtreeviz' package for visualization and analysis of decision trees and classifiers.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's own version information and imports specific functions and classes from submodules within 'dtreeviz'.",
  "sinks": "There are no obvious sinks in this code; no untrusted data handling or external network interactions are present.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules and functions; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is observed.",
  "anomalies": "All imports are from internal or standard library-like modules; there are no signs of unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for the 'dtreeviz' package. There are no data inputs, user inputs, or external data sources involved. No potential data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior is evident. The commented-out section suggests a planned API, but it is not active. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward setup for visualization tasks, with no malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard import setup for the 'dtreeviz' visualization package. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data flows, and poses no security risks based on the content. It is safe for use.",
