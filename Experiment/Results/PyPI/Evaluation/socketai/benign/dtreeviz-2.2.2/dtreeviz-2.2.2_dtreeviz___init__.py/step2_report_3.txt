  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to verify the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as static import statements from the 'dtreeviz' package.\n- No dynamic code execution, data processing, or network activity is observed.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n- The code appears to be standard setup code for a visualization library.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations on Code Content:\n- The code only performs import statements, including a commented-out section for a new API.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.\n- The version import is straightforward.\n- The commented-out code indicates possible API transition but does not impact security.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**No issues are present in the code itself.**\n\n---\n\n### Flaws, Errors, or Mistakes in Reports:\n- All reports are consistent in their reasoning.\n- They correctly identify that the code is static, benign, and only imports modules.\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are apparent in their summaries.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**No flaws or mistakes are identified in the reports.**\n\n---\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the static, benign nature.\n- Confidence levels are high, which is justified.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, matching the lack of obfuscation.\n\n**Suggestions:**  \n- The scores are reasonable; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Risk and Malware Scores:\n- Since the code is purely static imports with no malicious activity, scores of 0 for malware and security risk are justified.\n- The code does not process untrusted data, perform network calls, or execute dynamic code.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**Scores of 0 for malware and security risk are appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n### Potential Vulnerabilities Based on Assumptions:\n- No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the reports are cautious and accurate.\n- The commented-out code does not imply malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency of Scores:\n- All reports are consistent with each other and with the code content.\n- The high confidence scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe code is a standard, static import setup with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my evaluation:**\n- The code is benign and poses no security risks.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate.\n- No further action or concern is warranted.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
