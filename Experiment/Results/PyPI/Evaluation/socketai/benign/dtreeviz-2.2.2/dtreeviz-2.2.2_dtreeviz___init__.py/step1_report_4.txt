{
  "purpose": "The code imports various components from the 'dtreeviz' visualization library, including APIs and compatibility modules for visualizing decision trees and classifiers.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (e.g., .version, dtreeviz.utils, dtreeviz.trees, dtreeviz.compatibility, dtreeviz.classifiers)",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks; no network, file, or environment variable operations are present.",
  "flows": "Imports are static and do not process or transfer untrusted data at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains commented-out import statements, which are harmless but could indicate previous or potential alternative functionalities. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The script only performs import operations from the 'dtreeviz' package and a local version module. No data processing, user input, or network operations are present. The imports are from well-known modules related to visualization. Commented code does not introduce malicious behavior but suggests previous or alternative use cases. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import setup for visualization tools from the 'dtreeviz' package, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It appears to be a standard part of a visualization or analysis module.",
