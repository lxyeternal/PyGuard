  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the nature of the imports, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It performs static imports from the 'dtreeviz' package and a local version module.\n- Contains commented-out code for a new API.\n- No dynamic code execution, data processing, network activity, or user input handling.\n- All imports are from internal or well-known modules, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies the code as static imports, with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk at 0 are appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior or vulnerabilities are evident.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the straightforward nature of imports.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk at 0 are justified.\n- **Comment:** No issues here; the analysis is sound.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Recognizes the code as purely import statements, with no external data handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk at 0 are correct.\n- **Note:** The mention of a commented-out API is benign.\n- **Verdict:** Consistent and appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; the code is just imports with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk at 0 are justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Also aligns with the previous analyses.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk at 0 are appropriate.\n- **Comment:** No obfuscation or malicious patterns detected.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 across all reports, matching the straightforward import statements.\n- **Risk Score:** All are at 0, justified by the absence of dynamic or external interactions.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- **Potential for Hidden Malicious Code:** No evidence suggests any hidden or malicious code exists.\n- **Commented-out code:** Merely indicates API transition; no security concern.\n- **Any assumptions about vulnerabilities:** The reports correctly avoid speculative claims.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\nBased on the static, benign nature of this code snippet, I would assign the following scores:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** **0** (no security risk)\n\n**If I were to suggest any adjustments:**  \nThe reports are already consistent with my assessment. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, safe import setup for a visualization library, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
