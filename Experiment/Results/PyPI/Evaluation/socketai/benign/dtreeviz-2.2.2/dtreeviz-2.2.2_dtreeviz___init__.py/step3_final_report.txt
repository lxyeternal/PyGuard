{
  "purpose": "Static import statements for the 'dtreeviz' visualization library, including version info and API components.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules and commented-out API transition code.",
  "sinks": "None; static code with no data processing or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "No data flow; purely static import declarations.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of commented-out code indicating API transition, but no malicious or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements from the 'dtreeviz' package and a local version module. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling is present. Commented-out code suggests API updates but does not imply malicious intent. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns. All signals indicate benign static setup code for a visualization library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and poses no security threat. It contains only import statements with no malicious or maliciously obfuscated behavior. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all appropriately zero.",
