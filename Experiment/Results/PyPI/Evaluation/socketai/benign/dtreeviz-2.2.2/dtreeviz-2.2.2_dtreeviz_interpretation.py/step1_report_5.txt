{
  "purpose": "Provides explanation methods for decision tree model predictions, including plain English path interpretation and feature importance visualization.",
  "sources": "Reads input data 'x' (instance to explain), accesses features, thresholds, and prediction path from the ShadowDecTree object.",
  "sinks": "Generates textual explanation of decision path; visualizes feature importance using matplotlib. No data leaks or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "Input 'x' flows into prediction path methods; features and thresholds are accessed; decision paths inform explanations; visualizations depend on matplotlib plotting functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code detected. Uses standard libraries and functions. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors evident.",
  "analysis": "The code implements interpretability functions for decision tree models, using predictable data flow from the input instance to decision path extraction, and visualization of feature importance. No code injection, external network calls, or malicious data handling are present. The logic is straightforward and focused on model explanation; dependencies are standard for data science tasks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign implementation of model explanation functions, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on standard libraries and normal data handling procedures.",
