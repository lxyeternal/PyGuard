{
  "purpose": "Provides interpretability for decision tree models by explaining prediction paths in plain English and visualizing feature importance.",
  "sources": "Model structure, feature thresholds, prediction path, feature importance data from ShadowDecTree methods, input instance x.",
  "sinks": "Text explanations and matplotlib plots; no external data leaks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through ShadowDecTree methods to generate explanations and importance visualizations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or obfuscation; TODO comment for refactoring noted but benign.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard interpretability functions relying on ShadowDecTree's API, with no malicious or obfuscated logic. It uses common libraries and external modules for visualization. No network activity, data exfiltration, or dynamic code execution is present. The code is straightforward and well-structured, aligning with typical explainability tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. It serves as a standard implementation for decision tree explanation and visualization. The low security risk scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
