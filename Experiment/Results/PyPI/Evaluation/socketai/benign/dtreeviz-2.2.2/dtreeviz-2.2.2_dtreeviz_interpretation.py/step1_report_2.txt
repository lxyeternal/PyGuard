{
  "purpose": "Provides explanations for decision tree prediction paths, either in plain English or via feature importance visualization.",
  "sources": "Reads input data 'x' for explanations, accesses tree structure via 'shadow_tree' methods, uses data from imported libraries.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that lead to data leakage, external network, or system modification. Visualization functions may output plots but do not harm system.",
  "flows": "Input 'x' is processed through 'shadow_tree' methods to generate explanations. No flow leads to external data transmission or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for explanation purposes; no unusual dynamic code execution, obfuscated parts, or hidden behaviors detected. Uses standard libraries and patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code implements explanation functions for decision trees, extracting feature thresholds, categorical values, and importance. It does not include any network activity, system modifications, or hidden behaviors. It relies on the 'shadow_tree' object for data access, which seems to be a model wrapper, and only produces textual explanations or plots. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are present. The logic is straightforward and consistent with explainability tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious implementation for decision tree explanation, focusing on interpretability. No malware behavior or malicious intent detected.",
