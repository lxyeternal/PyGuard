{
  "purpose": "The code loads datasets from public URLs, trains decision tree models, and visualizes the results using dtreeviz. It primarily serves data analysis and visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "External datasets fetched via pd.read_csv from trusted URLs; data inputs for model training.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data exfiltration, network transmissions, or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded from external sources (sources) into pandas DataFrames, then passed into model training functions (sinks), with visualization functions displaying results locally.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data science tasks: fetching datasets from public URLs, training decision trees, and visualizing models. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. External data sources are reputable, and visualization is for interpretability. No network activity beyond data fetching is observed. The code structure is clear and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The external data sources are public and trustworthy. The visualization functions are standard for data analysis. The overall security risk is minimal, primarily related to external data dependencies, which are acceptable in this context.",
