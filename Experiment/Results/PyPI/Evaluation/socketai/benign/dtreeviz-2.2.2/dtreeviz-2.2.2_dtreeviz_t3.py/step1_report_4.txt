{
  "purpose": "The code loads datasets, trains decision tree models, and visualizes decision boundaries using dtreeviz. It aims to perform data analysis and visualization tasks on various datasets including cars, iris, and Titanic.",
  "sources": "Data is read from external URLs (GitHub raw links) and loaded into pandas DataFrames. Features are selected from the datasets for modeling.",
  "sinks": "Model training with scikit-learn, visualization functions, and display calls (show). No untrusted data is written or sent over the network.",
  "flows": "External datasets are loaded into DataFrames -> Data is processed (e.g., encoding categorical variables) -> Models are trained with local data -> Visualization functions generate visual output.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious data handling. All external URLs appear to be legitimate dataset sources for analysis. Visualization commands are standard and local.",
  "analysis": "The code loads datasets from public URLs, processes data, and trains decision tree models for regression and classification tasks. It uses dtreeviz for visualization, which is a standard library for visualizing decision trees. The code includes commented-out sections for additional datasets and visualization options, but no obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious behavior is present. No data is sent externally, nor are there any signs of backdoors, data theft, or harmful actions. The code appears to be for legitimate data analysis purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs data loading, model training, and visualization tasks using open-source datasets and well-known libraries. There are no indications of malicious intent, malicious payloads, or security risks. It is safe and intended for legitimate data analysis and visualization.",
