{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to load datasets, train decision tree models for regression and classification tasks, and visualize the decision trees using dtreeviz.",
  "sources": "Data is read from external URLs (GitHub raw content), and datasets are loaded via pandas.read_csv. The code also uses model training functions from scikit-learn.",
  "sinks": "Visualization functions (viz_rmodel.view(), plt.show()), which display plots; no data is sent elsewhere. No untrusted data output or network transmission observed.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded from URLs → processed and used to train models → models are visualized with dtreeviz, which displays graphics locally.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code segments, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors present. The code uses standard libraries and typical machine learning workflows.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data loading, preprocessing, model training, and visualization steps. URLs are publicly accessible and contain datasets related to cars, iris, and Titanic data. No indication of malicious intent or suspicious behavior is observed. Visualization functions are used for interpretability, not malicious purposes. The code contains commented-out lines for optional visualization configurations but nothing that indicates malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a straightforward machine learning visualization tool, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply loads datasets, trains models, and visualizes results locally. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or malicious code detected.",
