{
  "purpose": "The code loads datasets, trains decision tree models, and visualizes the decision boundaries using dtreeviz, primarily for data analysis and visualization tasks.",
  "sources": "Datasets are fetched from external URLs (GitHub raw content), and data is loaded via pandas read_csv. The code also uses user-supplied data in the Titanic example.",
  "sinks": "The code does not send data over the network, write to files, or execute untrusted commands. Visualizations are displayed locally with plt.show().",
  "flows": "Data flows from external sources into pandas DataFrames, then into sklearn models for training, and finally into visualization functions. No untrusted data is written or transmitted externally.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are present. The code follows standard data science procedures; no obfuscated or malicious constructs are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports popular data science libraries, loads datasets from public URLs, processes data, trains decision tree models, and visualizes them. All operations are typical for data analysis workflows. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious system commands, is observed. External dataset access is legitimate and for visualization purposes. The visualization functions are standard and do not perform any hidden or malicious actions. No use of dynamic code execution or obfuscated patterns. Overall, the code appears to be intended for educational or analytical visualization without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard data loading, model training, and visualization for analysis purposes. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks is found. It is a typical data science script without any suspicious activities.",
