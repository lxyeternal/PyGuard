{
  "purpose": "The code primarily loads datasets, trains decision tree models, and visualizes them using the dtreeviz library for different datasets including cars, iris, and Titanic.",
  "sources": "Dataset URLs for cars and Titanic, local data from sklearn (iris), and input data from CSV files. Reads datasets via pandas.read_csv and loads sklearn datasets.",
  "sinks": "Visualization functions from dtreeviz (view and rtree_feature_space3D) which generate visual outputs. No evidence of data exfiltration, system modification, or network activity. No untrusted data execution or external command invocation observed.",
  "flows": "Data loaded from URLs and local variables into pandas dataframes, then into model training functions. Model objects and visualizations use in-memory data only. No data flows into network or external processes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic present. The code performs standard data science tasks: dataset loading, preprocessing, model training, visualization.",
  "analysis": "The code loads datasets from external URLs and local variables, trains decision trees, and visualizes them. It uses standard libraries and functions without any suspicious dynamic code execution, network activity, or system modifications. Commented-out code does not indicate malicious intent. No indication of backdoors, credential theft, or covert data exfiltration. Visualization functions are benign, meant for analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate data science workflow utilizing open-source libraries for model training and visualization. No malicious or suspicious behavior identified.",
