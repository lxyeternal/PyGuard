  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for packaging a Python library (azure-ai-resources) for distribution via PyPI, including reading version info, dependencies, and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from '_version.py', reads README.md and CHANGELOG.md files, and gathers package data and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None identified that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions; no untrusted data is used in a dangerous manner.",
  "flows": "Version info is extracted from a local file, and this data flows into the setup function to define package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behavior observed. The script uses standard setup procedures. No hardcoded secrets or code injection points detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup routines, including reading version info, package data, and dependencies. All file reads are from local, trusted files. No dynamic code execution or external untrusted input handling is present. The code appears to follow typical setup patterns for a Python package, with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It safely reads local files for package metadata and dependencies, following common practices.",
