  "purpose": "The script configures the setup process for a Python package named 'azure-ai-resources', including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from '_version.py', reads 'README.md' and 'CHANGELOG.md', and gathers package files via find_packages.",
  "sinks": "Uses the 'setup()' function from setuptools to process package metadata and dependencies; no direct sink for untrusted data; no network or system modification present.",
  "flows": "Reads version info and README files (sources) to pass data into setup() (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior observed. The version extraction via regex appears standard; no obfuscated or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package. It extracts version info from a '_version.py' file using regex, reads documentation files, and invokes setuptools.setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and package data. The dependencies are explicitly listed with version bounds, and the author info is typical for a package setup. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious behaviors. All operations are consistent with typical package distribution scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs normal package configuration tasks without any suspicious behavior.",
