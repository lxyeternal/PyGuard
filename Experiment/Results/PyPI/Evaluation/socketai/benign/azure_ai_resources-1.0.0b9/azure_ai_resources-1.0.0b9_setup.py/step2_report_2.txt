  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** Standard setup.py analysis; no malicious activity, no suspicious code, straightforward version extraction.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. The confidence is high (1).\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent; no issues detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1; standard package setup, no malicious behavior, straightforward logic.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. The confidence is high (1).\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Slightly more cautious, noting the version extraction via regex but concluding it's benign. The security risk is rated at 0.2, which is conservative.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly conservative but reasonable. No malicious activity detected; the small risk score accounts for the minor concern about parsing version info.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the standard nature of the setup script, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—standard setup script, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0. No signs of malicious code, network activity, or obfuscated logic.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with clear, readable code.\n- **Risk Score:** Mostly 0, with one report (Report 3) assigning a small 0.2, which is reasonable given the regex-based version extraction from a local file.\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n- The code is a standard, well-structured setup script for a Python package.\n- No malicious activity, no obfuscation, no suspicious logic.\n- The only minor concern is the regex extraction of version info, but this is a common pattern and not inherently risky unless the source file is malicious. Given the context, this is safe.\n- The security risk scores are appropriately low.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (a very conservative adjustment considering the regex extraction, but it's standard practice and not risky)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, standard, and does not pose security risks. The current reports are accurate, and the scores are reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The analysis confirms that the setup script is benign and follows best practices for package configuration.",
