  "purpose": "Standard setup.py script for configuring and packaging a Python SDK, reading version info from a local file, and setting package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from '_version.py', reading 'README.md' and 'CHANGELOG.md' files.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static files are read locally without network or dynamic execution.",
  "flows": "Version info flows from '_version.py' into setup(); static documentation files are concatenated for long description.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or obfuscation; regex used for version extraction is standard; no external input handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, well-structured setup script for a Python package. It performs static file reads and uses regex for version extraction, which is common. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or user input handling is present. The regex-based version extraction assumes '_version.py' contains only a version string, which is standard practice. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are detected. The security implications are minimal, with no evident malicious behavior or vulnerabilities. The regex extraction from a trusted static file poses negligible risk, provided the file content remains controlled. Overall, the code is benign and follows best practices for package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a safe, standard package configuration file with no malicious or suspicious elements. The minimal risk associated with version extraction is acceptable, and the code does not pose security concerns.",
