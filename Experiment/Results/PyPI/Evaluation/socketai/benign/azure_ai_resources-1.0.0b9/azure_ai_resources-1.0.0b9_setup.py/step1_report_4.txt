{
  "purpose": "This code is for setting up a Python package distribution for the Azure AI resources SDK, including reading version info, metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from '_version.py', reads README.md and CHANGELOG.md files, and gathers package data.",
  "sinks": "No apparent untrusted data sinks. The setup function uses predefined variables and files for package configuration.",
  "flows": "The version string read from '_version.py' is used as the package version; other inputs are static or read from files, with no user input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected. The code primarily performs standard setup operations without any hidden or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks: reading version info from a source file using regex, loading markdown files, and configuring package metadata. All data sources are static or file-based. No untrusted data flows or injection points are present. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are observed. The code follows normal setup conventions and does not include code execution, network calls, or other potentially malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It safely reads necessary files and configures package metadata without any suspicious operations.",
