  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The script is a standard setup.py for a Python package, reading version info from a local file, reading markdown files, and calling `setup()`.\n- **Security assessment:** No suspicious code, no dynamic execution, no network activity, no obfuscated code.\n- **Malware risk:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, confirms standard setup procedures, version extraction via regex, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Security assessment:** No malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Malware risk:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Same as above, notes that version is read from a local file with regex, no external input, no malicious activity.\n- **Potential concern:** Slight mention of the '_version.py' content, but as long as it only contains a version string, it's benign.\n- **Malware risk:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 (very low, mainly due to reliance on local files, but no actual risk identified)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Confirms standard setup process, no suspicious code, no external input, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware risk:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard package setup, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware risk:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code presence:** The code is a typical `setup.py` script, performing standard package configuration tasks.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or malware. The only potential concern is the regex-based version extraction from `_version.py`. However, since this is a static file within the package, and the regex is simple, this is not a security risk.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns detected.\n- **Security risks:** The script does not handle untrusted user input, nor does it perform network operations or dynamic code execution. The minimal risk associated with reading local files is negligible.\n- **Scores:** All reports appropriately assign a malware score of 0. The security risk score is very low, reflecting the minimal potential for harm.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The overall malware score should remain **0**.\n- The obfuscated score should be **0**.\n- The security risk score should be **0** or very close to it, given the static and trusted nature of the files involved.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is a standard, benign package setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
