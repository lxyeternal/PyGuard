{
  "purpose": "The code is a pytest-based test suite for managing Azure AI resources, including listing, creating, updating, and deleting resources via the Azure SDK.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters, SDK method calls (e.g., ai_client.ai_resources), and the rand_num() function for resource naming.",
  "sinks": "Network calls to Azure cloud services via SDK methods, which are expected and standard; no untrusted data is transmitted maliciously.",
  "flows": "Input parameters and generated resource names flow into SDK calls for resource creation, update, and deletion; no malicious data flows are detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present; use of rand_num() is typical for test resource naming.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard test suite for Azure resource management, utilizing well-known SDKs and testing patterns. It performs expected operations without any malicious logic, backdoors, or obfuscation. No suspicious data flows or external untrusted data are involved. The use of rand_num() for resource names is typical in testing environments. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, safe, and free of malicious activity or supply chain sabotage. It functions as a standard test suite for Azure SDK resource management, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
