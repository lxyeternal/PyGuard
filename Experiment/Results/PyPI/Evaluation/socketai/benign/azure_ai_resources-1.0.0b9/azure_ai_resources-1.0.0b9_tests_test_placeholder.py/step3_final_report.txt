  "purpose": "A no-op test that allows pytest to exit success, and let CI pass.",
  "sources": "None; the code contains no input or data reading operations.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the function performs no operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward placeholder with no suspicious or malicious elements.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function with only a docstring and no executable statements. It performs no data processing, external calls, or side effects. All reports agree that this is a benign, non-malicious placeholder used for testing purposes. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless, standard placeholder function with no security concerns or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify it as benign, and the scores reflect this accurately.",
