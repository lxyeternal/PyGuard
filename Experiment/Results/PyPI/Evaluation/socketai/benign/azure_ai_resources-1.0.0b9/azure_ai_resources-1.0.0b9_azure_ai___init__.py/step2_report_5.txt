  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet, which imports 'pkgutil' and uses 'extend_path' on '__path__' and '__name__'.\n- The code is a minimal, standard pattern used in Python namespace packages.\n- No untrusted data, network activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation is present.\n- The purpose across reports is consistent: supporting namespace package distribution.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code functions as intended for namespace package support.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of malicious intent or behavior.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risk:** None evident; the code is a common pattern.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are apparent in the code or reasoning.\n\n### Score assessments:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0.0, appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0.0, consistent with benign, standard code.\n\n### Justification:\n- The code performs a standard operation for namespace package support.\n- No suspicious patterns, no external data flows, no obfuscation.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Overall malware score:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0\n- **Risk score:** 0.0\n\nThe code is benign and standard; no security concerns are present.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports correctly identify this snippet as a standard, benign namespace package support pattern with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n**Final estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the nature of the code.",
