  "purpose": "Support for namespace packages by extending __path__ using pkgutil's extend_path function.",
  "sources": "Import of 'pkgutil' module and usage of 'extend_path' on '__path__' and '__name__'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, user input, or external data sources; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Import of 'pkgutil' -> call to 'extend_path' on '__path__' with '__name__' -> modification of '__path__'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard pattern used in Python to support namespace packages. It imports 'pkgutil' and modifies '__path__' with 'extend_path', which is a common practice. There are no external inputs, network activity, or data leaks. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. All reports correctly identify the code as benign and standard, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and confidence of 1. The code aligns with typical Python packaging practices and poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard namespace package support snippet with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
