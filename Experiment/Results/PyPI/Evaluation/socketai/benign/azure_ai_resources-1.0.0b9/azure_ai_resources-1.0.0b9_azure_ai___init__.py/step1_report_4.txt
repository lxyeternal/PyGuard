  "purpose": "Extend the package's __path__ for namespace package support",
  "sources": "Import of 'pkgutil' module and extension of __path__ variable",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data or untrusted input handling",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow observed",
  "anomalies": "Use of extend_path to modify __path__ is standard for namespace packages, no malicious behavior or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkgutil' module and extends the __path__ variable, which is a common pattern in Python namespace packages. The operation is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no unusual or obfuscated code. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is minimal and standard for supporting namespace package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for namespace package support and shows no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
