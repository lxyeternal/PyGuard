{
  "purpose": "The code extends the package's __path__ using the pkgutil module, likely for package resource discovery or namespace package support.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __path__ variable and the __import__ function to import 'pkgutil'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code does not involve data flows from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, but using __import__ with a string argument is a common practice and not suspicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkgutil' module and extends the __path__ variable for the current package using extend_path(). This pattern is typical for supporting namespace packages in Python. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace package support snippet, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
