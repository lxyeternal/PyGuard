  "purpose": "Extend the module's __path__ attribute for namespace package support using pkgutil.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __path__ variable and imports the 'pkgutil' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and modifies __path__ via extend_path, which is a standard operation for namespace packages.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious variables, or hardcoded secrets. The use of __import__ and extend_path is standard for namespace packages.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and uses extend_path to modify __path__, a common pattern for supporting namespace packages in Python. There are no indications of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The code is minimal and follows standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical namespace package initialization snippet with no malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard practice in Python packaging.",
