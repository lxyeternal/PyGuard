  "purpose": "Extend the package's __path__ for module import resolution.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and uses '__import__' to extend __path__.",
  "sinks": "The extend_path function modifies __path__, but does not involve untrusted input or data sinks.",
  "flows": "Import 'pkgutil' -> call extend_path on __path__ with __name__ -> modifies __path__",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; the code is standard for namespace package support.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkgutil' module and uses '__import__' to call 'extend_path' on the __path__ variable. This pattern is common in namespace packages to support package extension across multiple directories or distributions. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The code does not perform any network operations, data leakage, or unsafe processing. It is a minimal, standard pattern for package extension.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation for namespace package support, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
