{
  "purpose": "This code extends the module search path using pkgutil's extend_path, likely for namespace package support.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and uses 'extend_path' on '__path__' and '__name__'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Import of 'pkgutil' -> execution of 'extend_path' with '__path__' and '__name__' as arguments.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no hardcoded secrets, suspicious patterns, or malicious constructs. The comment indicates copyright but no malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and modifies '__path__' using 'extend_path', which is a common pattern in Python namespace packages. There are no user inputs, no data flow to external systems, and no suspicious code constructs. The code is straightforward and intended for package management support.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign snippet used to support namespace packages, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues.",
