  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Describes tests for creating, retrieving, deleting connections, and scope behavior. Data flows through standard SDK calls, with no anomalies.\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** Uses hardcoded API keys (\"1234567\") and dummy resource names, typical in test code.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, and no network outside SDK. The security risk is minimal, mostly related to test credentials, which are intentionally dummy.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2 seem reasonable.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues. The code is standard test code with no malware.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on connection management. Uses dummy credentials and no suspicious behavior.\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No hardcoded secrets beyond placeholder API keys, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** No signs of malicious activity. The security risk remains low.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.1 are appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected; standard testing code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Tests connection management with standard SDK calls, dummy credentials, no suspicious logic.\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No obfuscation, no hidden code, no secrets beyond placeholders.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** No signs of malware or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2 seem justified.\n\n**Conclusion:** Legitimate test code, no malware.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Similar to above, extensive resource creation and cleanup, all within testing context.\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** Uses dummy API keys, no obfuscation, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** No malicious activity, network calls are SDK interactions only.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0 are appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** Safe, standard test code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Focuses on connection management, with typical SDK interactions and dummy credentials.\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No obfuscation, no secrets beyond placeholders, no suspicious code.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.1 are suitable.\n\n**Conclusion:** Legitimate testing code, no issues.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly have a malware score of 0. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are straightforward test scripts, so 0 is appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2) due to use of dummy credentials and resource creation, but these are standard in test environments. No real security risk.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, straightforward test code.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — Slight, typical for test code involving dummy credentials.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:** The reports are consistent and accurately reflect the code's benign nature. No changes are necessary.",
