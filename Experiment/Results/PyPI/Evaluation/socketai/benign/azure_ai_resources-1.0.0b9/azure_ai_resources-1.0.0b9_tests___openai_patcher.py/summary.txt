  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate testing utility designed for proxy-based request recording and playback. It does not contain malicious payloads or obfuscation. The main security concern is potential misuse if the proxy URL is compromised, but this is a controlled testing scenario. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate given the context."
