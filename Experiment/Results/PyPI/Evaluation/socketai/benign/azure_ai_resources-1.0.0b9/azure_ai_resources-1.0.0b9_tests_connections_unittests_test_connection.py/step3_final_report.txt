  "purpose": "Unit tests for AzureOpenAIConnection's environment variable setup, verifying correct configuration based on credentials and version.",
  "sources": "Input data from connection parameters and mock credentials",
  "sinks": "Environment variables set via os.environ.__setitem__",
  "flows": "Connection parameters and credentials influence environment variables set during set_current_environment()",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present; standard testing pattern",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign test suite that mocks environment variables and credentials to verify correct setting of environment variables in different scenarios. No malicious payloads, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The environment variable manipulations are typical for SDK configuration and are safely contained within mocks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, low risk) are consistent with the benign, testing nature of the code. No logical flaws or security concerns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe unit test for environment configuration with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate and justified. No further action or concern is warranted.",
