  "purpose": "Unit tests for AzureOpenAIConnection class methods related to setting environment variables based on connection parameters and credentials.",
  "sources": "Mocked environment variables and token retrieval via mock_credentials.get_token().",
  "sinks": "Environment variable assignments through mock_os_environ.__setitem__.",
  "flows": "Code reads credentials and connection info, then sets environment variables accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets beyond standard test strings; no obfuscated or unusual code; environment variables are set based on test data, which is typical for configuration but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code implements unit tests for a class that manages environment variables for Azure OpenAI connections. It uses mock objects to simulate credentials and environment. The environment variables set include API keys and tokens, but only in a controlled testing context. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior is observed. The environment variable modifications are standard for configuring connection parameters. The code does not execute untrusted data or perform network operations, file manipulations, or system commands that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for testing environment setup logic for Azure OpenAI connections and contains no malicious behavior. It does not introduce security risks or malicious payloads. All operations are confined to test mocks and standard environment variable setting, with no harmful intent.",
