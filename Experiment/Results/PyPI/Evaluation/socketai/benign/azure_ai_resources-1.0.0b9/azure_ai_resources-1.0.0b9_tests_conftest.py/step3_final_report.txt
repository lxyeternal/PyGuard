{
  "purpose": "The code provides test fixtures and sanitization routines for testing Azure SDK and OpenAI SDK integrations, focusing on environment variable handling, data sanitization, and proxy configuration.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, input parameters, and data within the test fixtures, including fake keys and tokens.",
  "sinks": "Sanitized environment variables and data, preventing leakage of sensitive information during tests.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables and input parameters through sanitization routines, with no malicious or suspicious data exfiltration or network activity observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a hardcoded fake key ('this is fake key') encoded in base64, which is standard in testing contexts; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of test fixtures, sanitization routines, and environment variable management aimed at safe testing of SDKs. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated techniques are present. The use of fake keys and sanitizers aligns with standard testing practices. Data flows are controlled and sanitized, with no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured testing setup with comprehensive sanitization routines. It poses no security threat, contains no malware or obfuscation, and is appropriate for its intended purpose.",
