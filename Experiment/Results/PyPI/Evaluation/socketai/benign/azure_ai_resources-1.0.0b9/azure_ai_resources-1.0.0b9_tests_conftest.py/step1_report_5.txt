{
  "purpose": "The code sets up fixtures and utilities for testing Azure AI and ML services, sanitizes sensitive information for recordings, and manages environment variables for testing.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, importing modules, and initializing test fixtures.",
  "sinks": "None directly; no data flows to external systems or untrusted inputs.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are sanitized and used in fixture functions; no untrusted data flows to external systems or code execution points.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected; no hardcoded credentials (except a fake key for testing), no backdoors, and no malicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily involves setting up testing fixtures, sanitizing sensitive data, and managing environment variables. It uses standard libraries and test utilities, with sanitization procedures in place to mask sensitive data like API keys and tokens. No untrusted input sources are evident that could lead to injection or data leaks. The use of fake keys and sanitized environment variables indicates testing focus, not malicious intent. No obfuscated code, suspicious network activity, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a secure test setup with proper sanitization, no malicious behavior detected, and no security risks beyond normal testing infrastructure. It does not contain any malware or malicious intent, serving solely to facilitate testing and data sanitization.",
