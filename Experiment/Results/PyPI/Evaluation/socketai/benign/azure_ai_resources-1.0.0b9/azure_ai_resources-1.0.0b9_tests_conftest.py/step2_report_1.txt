  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focused on setting up fixtures and sanitizers for testing Azure/OpenAI services. Sources are environment variables and input parameters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Sanitization of environment variables and data, no direct leakage or malicious output.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Use of standard sanitization routines; no suspicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors. The logic is straightforward, primarily for testing.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, safe test setup with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0 (no malicious code)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (no obfuscation)  \n- Risk: 0.2 (low, standard testing environment)  \n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on fixtures, sanitization, and environment setup.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Environment variables sanitized; no suspicious data flow.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets outside testing context; routines are standard.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard testing setup, no malicious activity.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Reasonable and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Testing fixtures, sanitization, environment variables, including a base64-encoded fake key.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Sensitive data sanitized; environment variables used for credentials.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Use of a hardcoded fake key (\"this is fake key\") encoded in base64 is typical for testing, not malicious. No obfuscation or malicious code detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign test setup, with proper sanitization routines.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Fixtures, sanitization, proxy configuration.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Sensitive data sanitized; data flows through environment variables and proxies.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Use of base64 fake key, standard sanitization routines, no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Typical test setup, no malicious activity.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Fixtures, sanitization, environment variables.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks or suspicious flows.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation or malicious code; use of fake keys for testing.\n- **Conclusion:** Secure test setup, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 (very low, standard testing)\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports indicate no malicious activity. The use of fake keys and sanitization routines are standard in testing environments.\n- **Obfuscated Scores:** No obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly above zero, reflecting the testing context but no real security threat.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — No obfuscation present.\n- **Risk:** **0.1 to 0.2** — Slightly elevated due to environment variables and sanitization routines, but nothing malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent, and the code is a standard, benign testing setup with proper sanitization and no signs of malicious activity. The scores assigned are reasonable and reflect the safe nature of the code.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nMaintain malware and obfuscated scores at 0; keep the risk score low (~0.1-0.2).
