  "purpose": "Extend the module's search path for package import resolution",
  "sources": "__path__ variable assignment and __import__('pkgutil')",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no data leaks or external actions detected",
  "flows": "Assignment of __path__ using pkgutil.extend_path(__path__, __name__)",
  "anomalies": "The code performs a typical package path extension; no suspicious or unusual behavior",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to extend the __path__ variable for a package using pkgutil's extend_path method, which is standard in namespace package implementations. The import of 'pkgutil' is straightforward and used here for a common purpose. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks. The code is minimal and follows standard practices for namespace package setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for namespace package path extension, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
