{
  "purpose": "Extend the package's __path__ to support namespace packages.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and uses '__import__' to dynamically load 'pkgutil'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data leaks or malicious actions are evident.",
  "flows": "The dynamic import of 'pkgutil' and extension of __path__ does not involve untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __import__ with a string is somewhat dynamic but standard for namespace packages; no malicious or suspicious activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal namespace package setup, extending __path__ with 'pkgutil.extend_path'. It does not include any hardcoded secrets, network operations, or malicious behavior. The dynamic import via __import__ is typical in package namespace implementations. No anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign snippet for namespace package support, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
