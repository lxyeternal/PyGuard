  "purpose": "Extend the package's __path__ attribute for namespace package support.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and uses 'extend_path' with __path__ and __name__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no data leaks or security-sensitive actions are evident.",
  "flows": "The import of 'pkgutil' leads to calling 'extend_path' on __path__ using __name__.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no suspicious or unusual patterns. The use of 'extend_path' is a standard namespace package technique.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkgutil' module and modifies __path__ using 'extend_path', which is typical for supporting namespace packages in Python. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward and uses common Python package management idioms.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be standard package boilerplate for supporting namespace packages and contains no malicious intent or security risks.",
