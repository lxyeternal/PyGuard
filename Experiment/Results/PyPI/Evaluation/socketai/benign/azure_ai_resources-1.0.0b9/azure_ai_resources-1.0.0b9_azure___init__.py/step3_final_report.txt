  "anomalies": "Use of __import__ with a string, but this is standard in namespace package patterns; no suspicious or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard pattern for supporting namespace packages in Python. It dynamically imports 'pkgutil' and extends __path__, which is common practice. No untrusted data, network activity, or data leaks are present. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. All scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are zero, consistent with the benign nature of the code. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), as the pattern is well-known and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for namespace package support in Python. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk code is present. The scores are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
