  "purpose": "Extend the package's __path__ for module loading",
  "sources": "The line __import__('pkgutil').extend_path(__path__, __name__)",
  "sinks": "No direct sink for untrusted data or potential data leaks",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; the code dynamically extends the module path, which is standard practice",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkgutil' module and calls 'extend_path' to modify the __path__ variable, which is used for package resource lookup. This is a common technique in namespace packages to combine multiple directories. No hardcoded secrets, no code injection, no suspicious logic present. The code's purpose is to support namespace package functionality, not malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for namespace packages, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
