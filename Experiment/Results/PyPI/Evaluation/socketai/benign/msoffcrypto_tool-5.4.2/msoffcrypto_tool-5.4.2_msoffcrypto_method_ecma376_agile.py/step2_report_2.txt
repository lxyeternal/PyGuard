  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the provided conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code implements cryptographic functions for Office document encryption, with no signs of malicious behavior. The analysis notes standard cryptographic practices, no backdoors, and no obfuscation.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the conclusion that no malicious activity is detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear, not obfuscated.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — low, consistent with standard cryptographic code.\n\n- **Comments:** The report's conclusion seems reasonable. The code appears legitimate, standard, and without malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing cryptographic standards, no malicious behavior, and standard practices. Notes static cryptographic parameters but no suspicious activity.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — low.\n\n- **Comments:** The presence of hardcoded cryptographic constants is typical but could be misused if misconfigured. Still, no signs of malicious activity are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on encryption, decryption, and integrity verification per ECMA376 standards. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — low.\n\n- **Comments:** The analysis aligns with the code's purpose and implementation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Details cryptographic functions for Office encryption, including key derivation, AES, HMAC, and password verification. Notes static bytearrays but considers them standard for the domain.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — low.\n\n- **Comments:** The presence of static constants is typical in cryptographic standards, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar cryptographic utility, with static parameters, standard functions, and no signs of malicious activity. Notes potential misuse if constants are exploited but no direct evidence.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the conclusion.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — low.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which seems reasonable given the analysis. The code performs cryptographic functions consistent with legitimate Office encryption schemes.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 across all reports; the code is not obfuscated.\n\n- **Risk Scores:** All at 0.2, indicating low security risk, which is appropriate for cryptographic utility code.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n\n- The static bytearrays such as `blkKey_VerifierHashInput`, `blkKey_encryptedVerifierHashValue`, etc., are typical for cryptographic parameter definitions, not signs of malicious backdoors.\n\n- No network activity, no hardcoded credentials beyond cryptographic constants, and no obfuscation.\n\n- The code is complex but aligns with standard cryptographic practices.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and well-structured.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — low, given the cryptographic context and no suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports' assessments are consistent with the code's nature. The code appears to be a legitimate cryptographic implementation for Office document encryption, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or sabotage. The static parameters are standard for such cryptographic schemes and do not indicate malicious intent.\n\n**Note:** Always ensure that such cryptographic modules are used within a secure environment and with proper configuration to prevent misuse.",
