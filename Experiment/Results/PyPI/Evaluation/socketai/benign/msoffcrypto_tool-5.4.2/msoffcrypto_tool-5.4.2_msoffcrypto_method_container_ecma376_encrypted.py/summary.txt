  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, purpose-built implementation for creating encrypted OLE files. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. The low malware score (0) and obfuscation score (0) are justified. The security risk score of 0.2 reflects potential misuse if malicious content is supplied, but the code itself is benign. Overall, the supply chain component appears safe and appropriate for its intended purpose."
