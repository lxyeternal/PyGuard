{
  "purpose": "A command-line tool for testing, encrypting, or decrypting Office files, supporting password input and file format validation.",
  "sources": "Input files via command line arguments ('infile'), password via command-line options or getpass(), environment variables indirectly through getpass() and sys.argv.",
  "sinks": "Writing output to files ('outfile') or stdout, printing messages to stderr or stdout, and calling encryption/decryption methods which process file data.",
  "flows": "Input files are checked for encryption status or processed for encryption/decryption; passwords are obtained from arguments or user input; data flows into encryption/decryption functions that handle file processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or unusual code patterns. Usage of standard libraries and external modules appears legitimate. No obfuscated code, no hidden network activities, or backdoors identified.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical command-line utility for Office file encryption and decryption. It validates input formats, handles passwords securely via getpass, and performs format-specific processing. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The use of standard libraries and packages like 'olefile' and 'msoffcrypto' aligns with intended functionality. The code's structure and logic are straightforward, with proper error handling for unsupported formats. No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for Office file encryption/decryption with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It properly handles input validation and sensitive data inputs. No malware behavior or supply chain threats are apparent.",
