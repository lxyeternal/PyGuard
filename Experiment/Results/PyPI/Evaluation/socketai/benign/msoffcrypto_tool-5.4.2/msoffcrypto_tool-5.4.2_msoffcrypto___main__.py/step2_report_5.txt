  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script is a command-line utility for encrypting/decrypting Office files, with no suspicious behavior or malicious code.\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, relying on well-established libraries (`msoffcrypto`, `olefile`) for cryptographic operations. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or network activity are evident.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 (very low, considering the utility nature).\n- **Verdict:** Valid. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard handling, no malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The code's logic is standard for such utilities. No suspicious patterns, no external network calls, no backdoors.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.\n- **Verdict:** Valid. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a command-line tool for Office file encryption/decryption, with standard libraries and no suspicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The code is consistent with typical cryptographic utilities. No external network activity, no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 (still low).\n- **Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to above, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Assessment:** The logic is straightforward, securely handling passwords, validating file formats, and performing encryption/decryption.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1.\n- **Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as others, no suspicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The code is a typical Office file encryption utility, relying on trusted libraries, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2.\n- **Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** The code snippets are all consistent with legitimate, open-source cryptographic utilities. They do not contain any hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports correctly identify no malware or obfuscation.\n- **Risk Scores:** Given the nature of the code—file encryption/decryption tools—risk scores should remain very low unless there is evidence of malicious intent or malicious payloads, which there isn't.\n- **Potential Vulnerabilities:** The only possible concern could be misuse of the tool for malicious purposes, but this is a common risk with cryptographic utilities and not a supply chain security issue per se.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at 0, as no malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the utility's purpose and the lack of malicious indicators, a risk score of around 0.1 to 0.2 is appropriate, aligning with the reports.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Metric          | Suggested Score |\n|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Malware         | **0**           |\n| Obfuscated      | **0**           |\n| Risk            | **0.1 - 0.2**   |\n\nThe reports are consistent with the code's behavior. No modifications needed.\n\n**Final note:** These are utility scripts for Office file encryption/decryption with no malicious traits or supply chain issues. The low risk scores are justified.",
