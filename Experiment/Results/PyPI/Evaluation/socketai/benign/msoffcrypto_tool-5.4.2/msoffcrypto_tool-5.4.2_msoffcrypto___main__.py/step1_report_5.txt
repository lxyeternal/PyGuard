{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to test, encrypt, or decrypt Microsoft Office files (OLE and OOXML formats) using provided or prompted passwords.",
  "sources": "User input from command-line arguments, stdin (getpass), and file inputs via argparse.FileType.",
  "sinks": "File read/write operations, password handling, and potential file encryption/decryption functions.",
  "flows": "Input data (files, passwords) are read, processed for encryption or decryption, and written back to output files or stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network operations. The code handles encryption/decryption securely using external libraries. No unusual or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard libraries and the 'msoffcrypto' package for handling Office file encryption. It verifies file types before processing, prompts for passwords securely, and manages file I/O. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are evident, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The script's behavior aligns with typical encryption/decryption utility functions.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate utility for encrypting/decrypting Office files, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It relies on well-known libraries and handles user data securely. No security risks or malware indicators are present.",
