{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to check if a file is encrypted or to encrypt/decrypt Office files (OLE or OOXML formats) using provided passwords.",
  "sources": "Input files via command line arguments, user input for passwords via getpass.getpass(), environment variables (platform detection), and package/version information via internal functions.",
  "sinks": "File output streams, logging output, and potentially sensitive file data being read or written during encryption/decryption processes.",
  "flows": "Input file read -> check encryption status or perform encryption/decryption -> output file written.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. The code uses standard libraries for file handling, platform detection, and cryptographic operations. No obfuscated code or hidden network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard Python libraries for command-line argument parsing, input/output handling, and cryptographic operations with msoffcrypto. It includes platform-specific handling for Windows. The functions perform file format checks, encryption, and decryption based on user input. No malicious code, data exfiltration, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code appears to be a typical Office file encryption/decryption utility, with no external network communications or hidden backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for Office file encryption/decryption. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware. No security risks are identified. The script relies on external libraries for cryptography and format handling, which are standard for this purpose.",
