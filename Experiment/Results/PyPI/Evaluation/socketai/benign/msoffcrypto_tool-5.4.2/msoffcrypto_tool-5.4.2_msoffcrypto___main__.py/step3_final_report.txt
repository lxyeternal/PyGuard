  "purpose": "A command-line utility for encrypting and decrypting Office files (OLE and OOXML formats), handling passwords securely, and performing format validation.",
  "sources": "User input via command-line arguments, environment info (platform, Python version), file streams for input/output, getpass for password entry.",
  "sinks": "File read/write operations, cryptographic processing delegated to trusted libraries, logging outputs, standard output streams.",
  "flows": "Input files are validated and processed through format checks, passwords are obtained securely, then files are encrypted or decrypted via library calls, with outputs written to specified files or stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no network activity, no backdoors or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of Office file encryption/decryption using well-established libraries (`msoffcrypto`, `olefile`). It performs necessary format validation, handles passwords securely, and provides verbose logging options. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The cryptographic operations are delegated to trusted external libraries, reducing the risk of hidden vulnerabilities. The code does not perform any network communication or data exfiltration. All signals indicate a legitimate utility with minimal inherent security risk, primarily related to potential misuse, which is typical for such tools.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, transparent Office file encryption/decryption utility with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or supply chain compromise. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting the inherent risks of cryptographic tools but no actual malicious intent.",
