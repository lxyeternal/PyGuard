  "purpose": "The class appears to be a placeholder or a minimal implementation, potentially part of a larger codebase.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data processing is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The class is empty with only a constructor that does nothing; there are no unusual or suspicious code elements.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class named 'ECMA376Extensible' with an __init__ method that contains no logic or data operations. There are no external dependencies, data inputs, outputs, or any behavior that could indicate malicious intent. The minimal structure suggests it may be a stub or placeholder. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is benign and contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a simple class definition with no functional implementation.",
