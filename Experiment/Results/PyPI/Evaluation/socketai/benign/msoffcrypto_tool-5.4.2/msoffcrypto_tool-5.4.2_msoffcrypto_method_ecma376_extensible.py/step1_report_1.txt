  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows exist in this minimal snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no suspicious or unusual patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an empty class with a constructor that performs no actions. There are no inputs, outputs, or complex logic. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are present. The simplicity suggests it is either a placeholder or part of a larger, benign codebase.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet appears harmless, serving as a class definition with no malicious intent or security issues. It does not perform any operations or data handling that could pose a threat.",
