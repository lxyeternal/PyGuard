{
  "purpose": "Definition of a class named ECMA376Extensible with no implemented functionality.",
  "sources": "No input or data sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks due to lack of code beyond class definition.",
  "anomalies": "Class is defined but contains no methods, attributes, or logic; very minimal code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code only declares an empty class with an initializer method that performs no actions. There are no external inputs, data processing, or output mechanisms. No suspicious or malicious patterns are evident. The simplicity suggests it might be a placeholder or part of a larger codebase, but on its own, it shows no malicious intent or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, contains no malicious behavior, and poses no security risks. It appears to be a simple class stub without functionality.",
