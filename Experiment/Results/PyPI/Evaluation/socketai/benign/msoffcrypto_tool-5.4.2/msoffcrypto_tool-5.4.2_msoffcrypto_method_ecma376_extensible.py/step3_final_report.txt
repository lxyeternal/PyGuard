  "purpose": "This code defines a minimal class 'ECMA376Extensible' with an empty constructor, serving as a placeholder or stub in a larger codebase.",
  "sources": "No data inputs, external data reads, or data flows are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks due to the absence of logic or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a straightforward class definition with no obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple class with an empty constructor, indicating it functions as a placeholder. No inputs, outputs, or external interactions are present. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, with consistent scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and a confidence of 1.0. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features justify these assessments. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security concerns. The reports are accurate and appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
