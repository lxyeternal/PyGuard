{
  "purpose": "Determine the format of a given Office file (Word, Excel, PowerPoint) based on its internal structure, and load the corresponding file handler.",
  "sources": "Reads the file stream (file.seek(0)), olefile.isOleFile(file), olefile.OleFileIO(file), olefile.exists() calls, import statements within functions.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; the function returns different objects based on file type. No data leakage or direct malicious data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "File stream is reset at the start. Checks on file type (OLE vs ZIP). Depending on file content, different handler classes are returned. No external untrusted data manipulation occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic import of modules within the function; no suspicious code execution, obfuscated logic, or hardcoded secrets. The code structure is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file format detection using known libraries (olefile, zipfile). It conditionally imports specific classes for handling Office formats. No code injection, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. No evident malicious behavior, privacy leaks, or sabotage. The only noteworthy aspect is the dynamic import based on file detection, which is common for such format-specific handling. No untrusted data processing beyond standard file format identification.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Office file format detector and loader, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It relies on well-established libraries for file type detection and does not perform any suspicious operations.",
