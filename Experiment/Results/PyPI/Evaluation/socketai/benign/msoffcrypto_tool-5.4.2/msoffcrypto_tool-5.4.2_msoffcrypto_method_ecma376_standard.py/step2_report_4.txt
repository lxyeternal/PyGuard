  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The code's cryptographic functions match the description. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious logic. The use of AES-ECB and SHA-1 is standard for ECMA376-related processes, though SHA-1 is outdated but not malicious.\n\n- **Errors/flaws:** No logical errors or security flaws evident. The logging of debug info could expose internal states but is standard for debugging.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 — justified; no malicious activity.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct; code is clear.\n  - Risk: 0.2 — low, consistent with minor concerns about debug logs.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Similar to Report 1, standard cryptographic functions with no malicious intent. The code performs decryption, verification, and key derivation properly.\n\n- **Errors/flaws:** No evident flaws. The use of SHA-1 is outdated but not malicious.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 — justified.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n  - Risk: 0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Again, standard cryptographic routines. The only notable point is the use of SHA-1, which is deprecated but not malicious.\n\n- **Errors/flaws:** No logical errors. The weak hashing algorithm could be considered a security weakness but not malicious.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 — justified.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n  - Risk: 0.2 — reasonable.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The code matches the described cryptographic functions. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Errors/flaws:** Use of SHA-1 is weak but not malicious. No other flaws.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 — justified.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n  - Risk: 0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above, standard cryptographic routines. The only concern is logging sensitive data, which could be a security risk if logs are exposed, but not malicious.\n\n- **Errors/flaws:** No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The potential security concern about logs is a common best practice issue, not a malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 — justified.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n  - Risk: 0.2 — reasonable.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0.2, reflecting minor concerns about deprecated hashing and debug logging, but nothing severe.\n\n### Final recommendation:\n\n- The scores across all reports are consistent and justified.\n- The only note is that SHA-1 is outdated, which could be flagged as a security weakness, but not as malicious or obfuscated behavior.\n- The debug logging should be noted as a potential information leak risk if logs are accessible, but this is standard debugging practice.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious intent or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — minor security concern due to SHA-1 and debug logs, but not critical.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate given the code's behavior.",
