  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of ECMA376 cryptography routines with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The minor security weaknesses (SHA-1 and debug logs) are acknowledged but do not elevate the overall risk significantly. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
