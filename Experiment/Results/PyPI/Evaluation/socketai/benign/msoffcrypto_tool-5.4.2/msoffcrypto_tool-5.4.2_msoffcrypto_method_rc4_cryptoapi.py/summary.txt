  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of legacy document encryption routines, not malicious or obfuscated. The primary concern is the use of insecure cryptography, which warrants modernization but does not constitute malware. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk is moderate (~0.2–0.4) due to cryptographic weaknesses."
