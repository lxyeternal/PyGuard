{
  "purpose": "The code implements asynchronous trigger classes for managing Apache Beam pipelines within Airflow, handling GCS file retrieval and pipeline execution status monitoring.",
  "sources": "GCS URLs for Python files and JAR files, accessed via GCSHook; input parameters for pipeline configuration.",
  "sinks": "No data leakage or malicious output; primarily external system calls and status reporting.",
  "flows": "GCS file fetch from URLs starting with 'gs://', then starting pipelines via hooks, with exception handling and status reporting.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard cloud interaction patterns with proper async handling, exception management, and no signs of malicious behavior. GCS interactions are typical for cloud workflows. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are present. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to external file sources, which is common in cloud orchestration. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, well-structured, and free from malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk reflects typical cloud file handling, with no evidence of supply chain attack or sabotage.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
