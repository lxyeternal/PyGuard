  "purpose": "Utility for orchestrating Apache Beam pipelines via subprocesses, environment setup, and logging within Airflow.",
  "sources": "External parameters such as variables, options, and environment variables used to construct subprocess commands.",
  "sinks": "Execution of subprocess commands that could potentially be influenced by untrusted input, leading to command injection if not properly sanitized.",
  "flows": "External variables and options flow into command construction; commands are executed via subprocess or asyncio subprocess, with output logged and monitored.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads detected. Use of subprocess with parameters derived from external inputs; mitigated by shlex.quote in async calls.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages pipeline execution, environment setup, and output logging. It employs safe practices like shlex quoting for subprocess arguments. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The main security concern is command injection risk if inputs are untrusted, but the code mitigates this with proper argument quoting. No signs of sabotage, data exfiltration, or covert operations are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and aligns with standard pipeline orchestration practices. No evidence of malicious intent or malware. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified. The slight risk score reflects potential command injection if inputs are untrusted, but this is mitigated by safe argument handling.",
