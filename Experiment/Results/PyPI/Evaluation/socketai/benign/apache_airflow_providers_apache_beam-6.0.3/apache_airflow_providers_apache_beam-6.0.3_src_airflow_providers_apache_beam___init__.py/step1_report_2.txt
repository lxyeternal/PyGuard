{
  "purpose": "This code appears to set up metadata and version checks for an Apache Airflow provider package, ensuring compatibility with the installed Airflow version.",
  "sources": "Reads the Airflow version from the imported airflow.__version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "Uses version parsing and comparison logic, no direct sink involving untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The code reads the airflow.__version__ variable, parses it, and raises an error if the version is below 2.9.0.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; standard version check and import statements. The code is automatically generated and includes licensing comments, which is typical for open-source modules.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, sets a version string, and checks if the current Airflow version meets a minimum requirement. It raises a RuntimeError if the version is too low. All operations are standard and related to package version validation. No obfuscated code, hidden logic, or malicious activity is present. The licensing comments and auto-generated note indicate typical package boilerplate.\n\nThe code reads a version string, parses it, and performs a comparison. There are no data leaks, backdoors, or suspicious network activities. It functions solely as a version check and setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical auto-generated setup/check script with no malicious intent. It performs version validation for compatibility, which is standard in package management. No security risks or malware detected.",
