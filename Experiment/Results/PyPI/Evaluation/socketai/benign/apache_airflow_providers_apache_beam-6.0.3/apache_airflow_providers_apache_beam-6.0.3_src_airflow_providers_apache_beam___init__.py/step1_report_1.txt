{
  "purpose": "This code is a generated file for managing version compatibility and licensing information within an Apache Airflow provider package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Airflow version via an import statement (`from airflow import __version__ as airflow_version`). It also contains a version comparison and raises an exception if the version is incompatible.",
  "sinks": "The code raises a RuntimeError based on the version check; no other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The source (airflow_version) flows into the version comparison logic, which may trigger the RuntimeError if the condition is met.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is straightforward, with license comments, imports, version check, and exception handling. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of license comments, import statements, version parsing, and a conditional check to ensure compatibility. It uses standard libraries (`packaging.version`) and performs a version comparison, raising an exception if the Airflow version is below 2.9.0. No input from untrusted sources, no data leakage, no malicious actions or suspicious constructs observed. The code's purpose appears to be environment validation for a package, which is common and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a license and version compatibility check script for an Apache Airflow provider package. It performs standard version validation without any malicious intent or security issues. No malware or malicious behavior detected.",
