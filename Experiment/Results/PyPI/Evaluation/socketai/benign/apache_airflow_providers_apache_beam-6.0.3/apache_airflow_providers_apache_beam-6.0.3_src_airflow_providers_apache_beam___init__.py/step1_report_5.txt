{
  "purpose": "This code is intended to set up version checking and module initialization for an Apache Airflow provider package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Airflow version via an import statement (`from airflow import __version__ as airflow_version`) and the hardcoded `__version__` string.",
  "sinks": "The version comparison logic could potentially influence runtime behavior, specifically raising an error if the Airflow version is too old.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing the Airflow version, parsing it, and comparing it against a minimum required version; if the condition is met, it raises a RuntimeError.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code is present. The code performs straightforward version checking and module setup without obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports a version string from the airflow module, then compares it to a required minimum version (2.9.0). If the installed Airflow version is less than 2.9.0, it raises an error indicating incompatibility. The code is standard for compatibility checks in Python packages, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. It contains only normal import statements, string parsing, comparison, and exception raising.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version check for compatibility, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It enforces a minimum Airflow version requirement and contains no suspicious or malicious code elements.",
