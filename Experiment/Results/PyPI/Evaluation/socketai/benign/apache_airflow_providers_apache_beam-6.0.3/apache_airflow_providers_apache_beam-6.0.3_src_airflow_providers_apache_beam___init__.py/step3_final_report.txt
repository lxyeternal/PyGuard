  "purpose": "Perform a license and environment version validation for the Apache Airflow provider package, ensuring compatibility with Airflow >= 2.9.0.",
  "sources": "Reads the __version__ attribute from airflow module via 'from airflow import __version__ as airflow_version'.",
  "sinks": "Raises RuntimeError if the Airflow version is below 2.9.0, halting execution.",
  "flows": "Imports airflow.__version__, parses and compares it with '2.9.0', and raises an exception if the condition is not met.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected; straightforward version check logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a generated script performing a standard environment validation by importing the current Airflow version, comparing it to a minimum required version, and raising an exception if incompatible. It uses 'packaging.version' for robust version parsing. No malicious behavior, data leaks, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The purpose is typical for package setup scripts, and the logic is correct and clear. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. There are no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated environment validation script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with its functionality. No further action or concern is warranted.",
