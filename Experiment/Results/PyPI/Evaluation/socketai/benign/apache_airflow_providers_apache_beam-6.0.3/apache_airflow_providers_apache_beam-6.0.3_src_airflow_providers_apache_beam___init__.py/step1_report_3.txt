{
  "purpose": "This code initializes metadata for an Apache Airflow provider package, sets a version string, and enforces a minimum required Airflow version.",
  "sources": "The code reads the imported module `airflow.__version__` and the hardcoded string version '6.0.3'. It also reads the `airflow_version` variable from the imported `airflow` module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that lead to potential data leaks or security effects. The only output is a version string and a runtime exception message.",
  "flows": "The code parses the Airflow version and compares it to a required minimum version; if the version is too low, it raises a RuntimeError with a descriptive message.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behaviors. The code contains only straightforward version parsing, comparison, and exception raising. No obfuscated code or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard version check for compatibility purposes. It imports necessary modules, sets version metadata, and enforces a minimum required version of Airflow. The `__version__` is hardcoded, and the version check is implemented via `packaging.version.parse`. There is no malicious behavior, code injection, or suspicious activity. The code appears to be part of a generated file intended for package management, with no indications of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a version enforcement check for the package. No malicious activity, suspicious anomalies, or security risks are present.",
