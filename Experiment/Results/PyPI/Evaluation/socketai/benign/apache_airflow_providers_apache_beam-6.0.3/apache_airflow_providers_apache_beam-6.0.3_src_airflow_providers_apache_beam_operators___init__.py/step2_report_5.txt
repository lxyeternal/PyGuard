  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify their assessments:\n\n1. **Report 1**\n   - The code is just license header comments, no executable code, data input, or data flow.\n   - The report correctly concludes there's no malicious behavior or security risk.\n   - Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate.\n   - The confidence is 1.0, which is reasonable given the clear nature of the code.\n\n2. **Report 2**\n   - Same as above: only license comments, no executable code or data flow.\n   - The conclusion is accurate.\n   - Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate.\n   - Confidence is 1, justified.\n\n3. **Report 3**\n   - Again, only license comments, no executable code or suspicious patterns.\n   - Correct conclusion.\n   - Scores: all zeroes are appropriate.\n   - Confidence: 1.\n\n4. **Report 4**\n   - Same reasoning applies.\n   - No executable or suspicious content.\n   - Scores: all zeroes.\n   - Confidence: 1.\n\n5. **Report 5**\n   - Consistent with previous, only license header comments.\n   - No issues identified.\n   - Scores: all zeroes.\n   - Confidence: 1.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code snippets are purely license headers with no executable code, data flow, or malicious activity.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, which is justified given the clear, benign nature of the code snippets.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- No changes needed to the scores or analysis.\n- The assessment aligns with the evidence: license headers are standard, benign, and pose no security risks.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- malware: 0\n- obfuscated: 0\n- securityRisk: 0\n\nThese are consistent with the reports and the nature of the code snippets.",
