  "purpose": "The code consists solely of license header comments with no executable code or data flow, serving as licensing information.",
  "sources": "No data sources; only static comments present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "No data or control flow; only comments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward license headers with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The provided snippets are purely license header comments with no executable code, data input/output, or data flows. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation. The confidence levels are appropriately high (1.0), and the assigned scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, reflecting the benign nature of the content. No issues or inconsistencies are present, and the assessments are accurate and justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets are benign license headers with no security risks or malicious intent. The reports are accurate, consistent, and require no modifications. The overall security risk is negligible, and the scores correctly reflect the benign status.",
