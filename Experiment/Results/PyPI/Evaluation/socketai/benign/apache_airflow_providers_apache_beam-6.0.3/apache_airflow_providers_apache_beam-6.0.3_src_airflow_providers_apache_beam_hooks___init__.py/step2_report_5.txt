  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the provided code is solely a license header comment block.\n- They consistently note the absence of executable code, data flows, sources, sinks, or anomalies.\n- The confidence scores are all at 1.0, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- The obfuscated, malware, and securityRisk scores are all 0, which aligns with the content.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Confirms no issues; no anomalies detected.  \n- Scores seem reasonable.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Same conclusions; standard license header.  \n- Scores are appropriate.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- No issues; standard license comment.  \n- Scores are appropriate.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Clear that there's no executable logic or suspicious activity.  \n- Scores are consistent.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Correctly identifies the code as non-executable licensing comments.  \n- Scores are appropriate.  \n\n**Assessment of scores:**  \n- All reports have assigned malware scores of 0, which is correct since there's no malicious code or behavior.  \n- Obfuscated scores are 0, matching the un-obfuscated nature of comments.  \n- The securityRisk scores are 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate.  \n- No anomalies, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present.  \n- The scores are reasonable and justified based on the provided code snippet.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nGiven the nature of the code, I would assign the following scores for an overall assessment:  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security risk:** 0  \n\nThis aligns with the reports and the actual content.",
