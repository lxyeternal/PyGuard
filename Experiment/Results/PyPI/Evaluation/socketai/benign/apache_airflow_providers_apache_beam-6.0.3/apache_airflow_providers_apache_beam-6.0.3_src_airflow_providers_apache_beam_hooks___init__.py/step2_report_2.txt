  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports identify the code as solely a license header comment, with no executable code, data input/output, or data flows.\n- The reasoning in each report is consistent: since the snippet contains only comments, there are no security risks, malware, or obfuscation.\n- The confidence levels are all 1.0, which is appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues:**  \n   All reports correctly conclude that there are no issues, anomalies, or malicious content in the provided code snippet.\n\n2. **Scores assigned:**  \n   - `malware`: all reports assign 0, which is appropriate.  \n   - `obfuscated`: all reports assign 0, which is correct since the code is plain comments.  \n   - `securityRisk`: all reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of executable code or suspicious patterns.\n\n3. **Potential concerns or errors:**  \n   - No errors or flaws are apparent in the reasoning.  \n   - The reasoning is thorough and consistent across all reports.\n\n4. **Risk scores justification:**  \n   - Since the code is only a license header comment, the risk scores should remain at 0.  \n   - No changes are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The scores are appropriate given the content.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is a standard license comment with no security implications.",
