  "purpose": "This code provides metadata information about the Apache Beam provider package for Apache Airflow, including version, dependencies, integrations, operators, hooks, and triggers.",
  "sources": "The code reads static package information from a hardcoded dictionary within the get_provider_info() function.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data outputs or external system interactions; the data is static and hardcoded within the function.",
  "flows": "The data flows from the static dictionary through the return statement in get_provider_info(). No external data sources or sinks are involved.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a straightforward data provider with no unusual or suspicious code constructs. No hardcoded secrets, environment variables, or dynamic code execution are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple, static function returning a structured dictionary with package metadata. It contains no external input handling, no code injection, and no suspicious behaviors. The content aligns with typical package metadata definitions. No anomalies or malicious indicators are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign metadata provider for the Apache Beam Airflow package. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard, static data-returning function with no suspicious elements.",
