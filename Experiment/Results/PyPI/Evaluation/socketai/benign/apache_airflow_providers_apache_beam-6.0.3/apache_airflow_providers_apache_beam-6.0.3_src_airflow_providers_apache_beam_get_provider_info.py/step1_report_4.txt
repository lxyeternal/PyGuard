{
  "purpose": "This code provides metadata information about the 'apache-airflow-providers-apache-beam' package, including versions, dependencies, integrations, operators, hooks, and triggers.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or user data; it only defines and returns a static dictionary object.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could cause a security issue, as no external data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the function returns a static data structure.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be auto-generated with standard package metadata; no unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a function that returns a predefined dictionary containing package metadata such as name, description, versions, dependencies, and associated modules. There are no external input sources, no data processing, no dynamic code execution, and no network activity. It is purely declarative and static, serving as a package manifest or metadata provider. The presence of version lists and dependency declarations is normal for package setup files. No malicious behaviors such as backdoors, data leaks, or system modifications are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward static metadata definition for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated code. It appears safe and typical for package information modules.",
