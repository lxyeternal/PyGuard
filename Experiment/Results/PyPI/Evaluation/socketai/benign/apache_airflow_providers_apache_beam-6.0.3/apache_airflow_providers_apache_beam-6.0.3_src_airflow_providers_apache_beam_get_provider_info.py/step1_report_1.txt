  "purpose": "This code provides metadata and configuration details for the 'apache-airflow-providers-apache-beam' Python package, including version info, dependencies, and documentation links.",
  "sources": "The function get_provider_info() returns a dictionary containing static data; no external input is read.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or user input; the code only returns predefined data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the function simply returns static information.",
  "anomalies": "The code is auto-generated, static, and does not perform any unusual operations. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a function returning a static dictionary with package metadata, version lists, dependencies, and documentation URLs. It does not read input, write output based on untrusted data, or execute any dynamic code. The content appears to be standard package info, and there are no signs of malicious behavior or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static metadata function typical for package configuration. It poses no security risks or malicious activity. It is safe to use and review.",
