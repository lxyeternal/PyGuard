{
  "purpose": "Provides static package metadata including versions, dependencies, and documentation links for the 'apache-airflow-providers-apache-beam' package.",
  "sources": "The function get_provider_info() returning a hardcoded dictionary with package info.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static data only.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, auto-generated, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static Python function returning package metadata, with no dynamic execution, input processing, or network activity. It contains no obfuscation, secrets, or malicious code. The dependency list and version info are typical for package configuration files. The malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores are all zero, consistent with the static, benign nature of the code. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the straightforward, static content and lack of suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static package metadata provider with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate, and the code poses no security concern.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
