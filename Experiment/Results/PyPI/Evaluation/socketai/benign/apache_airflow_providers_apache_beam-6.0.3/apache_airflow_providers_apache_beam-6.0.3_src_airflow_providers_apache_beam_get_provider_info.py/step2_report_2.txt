  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a static Python function returning a dictionary with package metadata.\n- No external input, dynamic code execution, network activity, or user data processing is present.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The code is auto-generated and straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly identifies the code as static metadata, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware & Risk Scores:** Both are 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Confidence:** 1, appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same as above; static data provider, no issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0, matching the benign nature.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly states the code is static, no external input, no dynamic code, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0, consistent.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n- **Verdict:** Valid.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same consistent findings; static package metadata.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same as others; static data, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as static, benign package metadata.\n- The malware score is correctly set to 0; no malicious activity is detected.\n- The security risk score is also correctly low (0), given the static, read-only nature.\n- The confidence levels are all high (1), consistent with the static, non-malicious analysis.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Scores:** Remain at 0 for malware and risk.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Justification:** The code is straightforward, static, and typical for package metadata, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- The analysis correctly concludes that the code is benign.\n\n**My estimate:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code poses no security concern and is a standard static metadata function.",
