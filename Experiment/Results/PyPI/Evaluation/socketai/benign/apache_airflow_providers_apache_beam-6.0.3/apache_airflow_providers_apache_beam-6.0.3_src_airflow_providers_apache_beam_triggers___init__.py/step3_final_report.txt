  "purpose": "This code is a standard Apache license header comment, serving as legal attribution and licensing information for the file.",
  "sources": "The license header itself, which contains no input or data reading operations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output data, nor does it interact with untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code is purely a comment block with no executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a standard license header with no suspicious or unusual elements.",
  "analysis": "The code is a license header comment with no executable code, data input/output, or data flows. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the content. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the straightforward nature of the code. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard license header with no malicious or security concerns. The assigned scores are justified, and no modifications are necessary.",
