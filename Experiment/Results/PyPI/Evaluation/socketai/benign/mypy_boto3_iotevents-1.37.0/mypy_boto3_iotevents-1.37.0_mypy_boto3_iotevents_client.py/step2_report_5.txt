  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and determine the appropriate scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes the code as type annotations and client interface for AWS IoT Events. No input reading or external data processing.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data sinks or flows; purely type annotations and method signatures.\n- **Anomalies:** Noted future copyright year (2025). No malicious indicators.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a standard SDK interface with no malicious behavior. The future year is likely a typo, not a security concern.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.5 (since it's a non-executable SDK stub, low risk but not zero), but the report assigns 0. Overall consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on type annotations and class definitions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or external calls.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns. The code is straightforward.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Clear, safe SDK stub. No malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.0. The report assigns 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, with mention of a future-dated copyright year (2025).\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** The only anomaly is the future year, which appears to be a typo.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; just a type stub with a minor typo.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0. The report assigns 0, consistent with analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous reports, defining method signatures with type annotations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or external network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, just standard SDK interface code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; safe stub code.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0. The report assigns 0, justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, emphasizing static type annotations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data sinks or external calls.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; only unpacking request types.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Clearly a benign stub for type checking, with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0. The report assigns 0, which aligns with the code.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None detected in any report.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with the code being purely SDK interface definitions.\n- **Risk scores:** Appropriately low, reflecting the non-executable, non-malicious nature of the code.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\nThe code is a set of type annotations and interface definitions for the AWS IoT Events SDK, intended to facilitate static type checking and IDE support. It contains no executable logic, data handling, or external communication beyond method signatures referencing AWS API calls. The only minor anomaly is a future year (2025) in the copyright, which is likely a typo and not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, as it's a non-executable SDK stub with no security risks)\n\nThis assessment confirms that the code is safe, standard, and non-malicious.",
