{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface definitions for AWS IoT Events service, facilitating type-safe API calls.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore modules, and local type_defs; class method definitions with unpacked request type definitions.",
  "sinks": "Method calls with unpacked parameters, but only passing data structures; no direct data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Method parameters unpacked from type defs serve as sources; method calls may send data to AWS services as sinks. No internal data flow or external network operations within the code itself.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or backdoors; code mainly consists of interface definitions and type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured interface for AWS IoT Events client with detailed type annotations, facilitating type safety. All methods are standard API call wrappers with no embedded logic, data processing, or external data handling. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious activities are detected. The code appears to be a clean, auto-generated stub for AWS service interaction, with appropriate use of type annotations and imports. There are no anomalies indicating malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign type definition and API client interface with no evidence of malicious behavior or security threats. It appears to be a standard, well-structured API stub implementation.",
