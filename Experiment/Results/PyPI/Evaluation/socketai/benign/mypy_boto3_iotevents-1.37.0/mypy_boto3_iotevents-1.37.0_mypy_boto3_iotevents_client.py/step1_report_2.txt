{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definitions for interacting with AWS IoT Events service, providing method signatures and exception handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore modules, and local type definitions; class and method definitions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network calls, file writes, or environment variable manipulations are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from sources to sinks are identifiable; code primarily defines method signatures and data types.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; no unusual or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of type annotations and class structures for AWS SDK client interactions, including exception classes and method signatures with type hints. It imports standard modules and type definitions, defines a client class with methods that correspond to AWS IoT Events operations, and does not perform any runtime data processing or network operations. No malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, type-annotated interface definition for AWS IoT Events SDK, serving as a client wrapper with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
