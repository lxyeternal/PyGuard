  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, the consistency of their scores, and whether any adjustments are warranted.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Confirms the code is a standard SDK interface with no malicious behavior. The code is primarily type annotations and method signatures for AWS IoT Events.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies the code as a non-malicious SDK stub with no data leaks or suspicious patterns.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, well-justified. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the code as a straightforward type-annotated client interface with no malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes the absence of suspicious patterns, no external requests, or data processing.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, justified. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights the purpose as providing type annotations, notes the future-dated copyright year (2025) as a minor anomaly, but not malicious.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n- **Analysis:** The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which is likely a typo or a placeholder, not malicious.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No need to adjust scores; the assessment is consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the interface nature, type annotations, and absence of malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states the code is a benign stub with no suspicious behaviors.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, confirms the code as a benign type annotation stub, with no malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious patterns or malicious intent detected.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is correct. The code is purely a type stub/interface with no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is correct. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the nature of the code.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a static, type-annotated interface for AWS SDK interaction, with no runtime logic, external data handling, or security-sensitive operations.\n\n- The only minor anomaly is the future-dated copyright year (2025), which is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk:** 0 — no security risk associated with this SDK stub.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** All reports are consistent and accurate. No changes or escalations are necessary. The code is a benign, well-structured SDK interface stub with no malicious or security concerns.",
