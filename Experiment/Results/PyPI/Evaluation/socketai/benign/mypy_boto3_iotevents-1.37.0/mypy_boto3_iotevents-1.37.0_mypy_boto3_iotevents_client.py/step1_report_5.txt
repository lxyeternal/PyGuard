{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for the AWS IoT Events service, providing method signatures and documentation links for a boto3 stub implementation.",
  "sources": "Imports of system modules, typing, and botocore classes; class definitions; method signatures with **kwargs unpacking request type definitions.",
  "sinks": "None observed. No untrusted data handling, network operations, or sensitive information leaks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "Method signatures accept untrusted input via **kwargs, but these are type-annotated request definitions; no actual data flow or processing logic is implemented.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code is straightforward, primarily consisting of method signatures and documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines type annotations, import statements, and a client class with method signatures for the AWS IoT Events API. There are no executable statements, data processing, or network operations. All imported modules and types are standard or documentation-specific. No suspicious patterns or malicious behavior are detected. The code appears to serve as a static type stub for boto3, intended for development or static analysis purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of type annotations and class definitions for a boto3 client, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as a type hinting aid without executing or transmitting data.",
