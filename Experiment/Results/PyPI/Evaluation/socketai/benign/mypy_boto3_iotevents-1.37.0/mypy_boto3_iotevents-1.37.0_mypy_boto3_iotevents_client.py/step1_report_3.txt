{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class for AWS IoT Events service to facilitate type-safe interactions with the AWS SDK.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class definitions, method signatures, and inline documentation comments.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing, external network calls, or dangerous command execution present.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only defines type annotations and client interface methods without data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a copyright date in 2025 is inconsistent with current year (2024), possibly a typo but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of type annotations, class definitions, method signatures, and docstrings referencing AWS SDK documentation. It does not perform any data processing, external requests, or execute code that could be malicious. The class 'IoTEventsClient' and 'Exceptions' are structured for type safety and error handling, respectively. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. The only minor anomaly is the future-dated copyright year which appears to be a typographical error. Overall, the code is straightforward, well-structured, and does not contain malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a safe, non-malicious code stub providing type annotations for the AWS IoT Events client. It contains no suspicious or malicious behavior, only type hints and documentation references for SDK usage.",
