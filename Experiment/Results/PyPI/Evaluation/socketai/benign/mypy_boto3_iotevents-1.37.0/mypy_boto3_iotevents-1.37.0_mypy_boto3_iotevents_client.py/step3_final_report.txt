{
  "purpose": "The code provides static type annotations and interface definitions for the AWS IoT Events client, facilitating type safety and IDE support without executing logic.",
  "sources": "Method signatures and type definitions that specify input parameters (via Unpack[TypeDef]) and return types; no runtime data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data flows; the code does not process or transmit data at runtime.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code consists solely of method signatures with type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "The only minor anomaly is the copyright year '2025', which appears to be a typo or placeholder, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static SDK interface with no executable logic, data processing, or network activity. It uses type annotations to define method signatures for AWS IoT Events operations. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The minimal anomaly (future year) does not impact security. The scores are consistent with the code's benign, static nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated SDK interface stub intended for static type checking. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which is likely a typo. Overall, the code is safe and non-malicious.",
