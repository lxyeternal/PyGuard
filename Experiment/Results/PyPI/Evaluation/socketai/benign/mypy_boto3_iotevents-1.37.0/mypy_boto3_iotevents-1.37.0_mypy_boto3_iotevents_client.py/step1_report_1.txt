  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface for AWS IoT Events service, used to interact with the service via boto3.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, botocore, and local type definitions. No input reading beyond library usage.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leak points. No network or file system operations are performed within this code.",
  "flows": "The code defines method signatures for interacting with AWS services, with parameters unpacked from type definitions. No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code strictly defines type annotations and client methods.",
  "analysis": "The code is a type-annotated Python module for the AWS IoT Events client, leveraging boto3 and botocore. It defines a class with method signatures corresponding to AWS API calls, including exception handling and pagination features. No executable logic, data processing, or external input handling is present. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are identified. The structure is consistent with SDK interface definitions and contains no indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, non-malicious SDK interface module for AWS IoT Events with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily provides type annotations for the client methods, ensuring correct usage and integration. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident.",
