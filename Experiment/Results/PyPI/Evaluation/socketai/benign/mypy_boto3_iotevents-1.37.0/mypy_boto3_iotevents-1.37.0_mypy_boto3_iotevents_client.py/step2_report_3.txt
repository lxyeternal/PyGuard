  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a type annotations and client interface for AWS IoT Events, with no suspicious or malicious patterns. It emphasizes that the code is purely for type safety and SDK interface purposes.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a non-executable, SDK interface module with no malicious behavior. The absence of data flow, network operations, or obfuscated code supports this.\n\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0 — reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the code's role as a type-safe SDK wrapper with no malicious activity. Confirms no data leaks or suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code's nature. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Notes the purpose as providing type annotations; points out the copyright date as being in 2025, which is inconsistent with the current year (2024). No malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Assessment:** The mention of the future copyright year is a minor anomaly, likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious. The rest of the analysis is consistent.\n\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0 — justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights the code as a standard API stub with no embedded logic, data processing, or external network calls. No suspicious patterns or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is purely for type annotations and interface definitions.\n\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0 — reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Emphasizes that the code only contains type annotations and method signatures, with no executable logic or data handling. No signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code's purpose. No malicious indicators.\n\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** No actual issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious code are present in the code. All reports agree on its benign nature.\n\n- **Anomalies:** The only minor anomaly is the 2025 copyright year, which is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n\n- **Scores justification:** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which is justified given the code's nature.\n\n- **Risk score:** The overall security risk is effectively zero, as the code is purely a static type stub.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and consensus of the reports.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, well-structured SDK interface with type annotations for AWS IoT Events. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The minor anomaly in the copyright year does not impact security.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0",
