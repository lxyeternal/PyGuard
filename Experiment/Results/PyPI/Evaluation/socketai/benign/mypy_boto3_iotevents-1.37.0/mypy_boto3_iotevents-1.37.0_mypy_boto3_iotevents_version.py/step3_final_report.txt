  "purpose": "Defines the package version as a static string assigned to __version__.",
  "sources": "No external sources; static assignment in code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external input; only static variable assignment.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or dynamic behavior.",
  "anomalies": "Comment includes a future year (2025), which is likely a typo or outdated but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static declaration of a version string with a comment. It contains no input, output, dynamic logic, or obfuscation. The only anomaly is the copyright year '2025', which is in the future relative to current date but does not impact security. All reports correctly identify the code as benign with malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0. Confidence scores are high, reflecting the straightforward nature. No suspicious patterns or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no security risks or malicious behavior. The only minor issue is the future copyright year, which is likely a typo, not a security concern. All assessments are accurate and consistent.",
