  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a straightforward version declaration with a copyright comment.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a copyright comment, a version string assignment, and no other logic. There are no input sources, no untrusted data, no data processing or external interactions. The version string appears static and hardcoded, typical for package versioning. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is minimal and standard for defining a package version.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks.",
