  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims based on the provided code snippet.\n\n**Code Under Review:**\n```python\n\"\"\"\nSource of truth for version.\n\nCopyright 2025 Vlad Emelianov\n\"\"\"\n\n__version__ = \"1.37.0\"\n```\n\n---\n\n### **General Observations:**\n- The code is a minimal, static assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- It contains only comments and a straightforward variable assignment.\n- No input/output, no external data sources, no dynamic behavior.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n- The copyright year is **2025**, which is in the future relative to October 2023, possibly a typo or an oversight.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of Each Report:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Define version string.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies the code as benign, straightforward, with no security risks.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 1, malware 0, securityRisk 0.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states no malicious behavior, standard version declaration.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 1, malware 0, securityRisk 0.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No dynamic behavior, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 1, malware 0, securityRisk 0.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Straightforward static assignment, no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 1, malware 0, securityRisk 0.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Anomaly:** The copyright year is **2025**, which is in the future.\n- **Analysis:** The comment's date is likely a typo or outdated, not malicious. The code itself is benign.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9 (slightly less due to the date anomaly), malware 0, securityRisk 0.  \n**Verdict:** The note about the future year is an anomaly but not a security concern. The overall assessment remains correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports correctly assign 0; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** All are 0, reflecting no security risk.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The only minor point is the future year (2025) in the comment, which is likely a typo or oversight. It doesn't impact security but could be corrected for accuracy.\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear and simple)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk present)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and comprehensive. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:** The code is a standard, benign version declaration with no security issues. The scores are appropriate, and the analysis is sound.",
