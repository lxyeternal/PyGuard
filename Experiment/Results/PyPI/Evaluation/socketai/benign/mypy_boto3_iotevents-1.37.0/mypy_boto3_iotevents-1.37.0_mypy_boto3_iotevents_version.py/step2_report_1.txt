  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and evaluate the underlying code:\n\n**Overall Code Content:**\n```python\n\"\"\"\nSource of truth for version.\n\nCopyright 2025 Vlad Emelianov\n\"\"\"\n\n__version__ = \"1.37.0\"\n```\n\n**Assessment of the Code:**\n- The code is a straightforward assignment of a static version string to `__version__`.\n- The comment is purely informational, including a copyright.\n- There are no input sources, external data, or dynamic logic.\n- No obfuscation, code execution, or data processing occurs.\n- The version string is hardcoded and static.\n- The code is typical for defining package version information.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly identifies the code as a benign version declaration.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate, with confidence 1.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Correctly identified as 0.\n- **Note:** No issues here.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, confirms the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriate.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Correctly 0.\n- **Note:** No issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same conclusion, no dynamic behavior.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correct.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Correctly 0.\n- **Note:** No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Again, straightforward assignment.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** 0.\n- **Additional Point:** No suspicious behavior; the comment is standard.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Mentions a copyright year \"2025\" which is beyond the current date, possibly a typo or outdated comment.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Still benign; no malicious code.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** 0.\n- **Note:** The only anomaly is the future year, which is likely a typo, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Are there any issues with the code?**  \n  No. The code is a minimal, static version declaration with no suspicious or malicious content.\n\n- **Are the scores appropriate?**  \n  All reports correctly assign malware and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Is there any reason to adjust scores?**  \n  No. The code does not contain obfuscation, dynamic behavior, or malicious patterns.\n\n- **Is the high confidence justified?**  \n  Yes. The code is straightforward and well-understood.\n\n- **Any inconsistencies?**  \n  The only minor point is the copyright year \"2025\" in Report 5, which could be a typo or oversight but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0** for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at **0**.\n- **Risk score:** Given the benign nature, should be **0** for all.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n| malware | obfuscated | risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is a simple, static version declaration with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign. No adjustments needed. The only minor note is the future year in the comment, which is a non-issue from a security perspective.",
