  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- The code is a minimal, static assignment of `__version__ = \"1.37.0\"` with a copyright comment.\n- There are no inputs, outputs, dynamic behaviors, or external data handling.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n- The only noted anomaly is the copyright year (2025), which is in the future relative to current date (assuming current year is 2024). This is likely a typo or outdated comment, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the issues in the code:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The only \"anomaly\" is the future copyright year, which is probably a typo.\n\n### Logical errors or flaws:\n- No logical errors are present.\n- The only potential flaw is the incorrect copyright year, but it does not impact security or functionality.\n\n### Scores assessment:\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n- Confidence scores are high (1 or 0.9), which is reasonable given the simplicity of the code.\n- The only questionable point is report 5's confidence of 0.9 due to the outdated year comment; this is minor and does not affect security.\n\n### Justification for any higher risk scores:\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities exists.\n- The code is straightforward and standard for version declaration.\n\n### Potential issues with the reports:\n- All reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n- The only minor point is the comment's year, but it does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0, no security risks.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the consensus that this code is benign, standard, and contains no security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate and appropriate. The code is a straightforward version string declaration with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The only minor note is the copyright year, which is likely a typo, not a security concern.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed; all scores are appropriate.",
