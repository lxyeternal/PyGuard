  "flows": "N/A – straightforward assignment without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a copyright year in the comment that is beyond the current date, which may be an oversight or typo.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains a comment with a copyright statement and a variable assignment setting __version__ to '1.37.0'. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or data leaks. The copyright year appears inconsistent with the current year, but this is likely a typo or outdated comment, not malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving solely as a version identifier with no malicious intent or security risks.",
