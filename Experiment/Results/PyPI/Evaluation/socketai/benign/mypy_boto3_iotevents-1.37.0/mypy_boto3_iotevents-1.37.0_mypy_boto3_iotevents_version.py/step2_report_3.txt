  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports identify the code as a simple, static assignment of a version string (__version__ = \"1.37.0\") with a copyright comment.\n- No input sources, external data, or dynamic behavior are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or complex logic.\n- The only minor anomaly noted is the copyright year (2025), which is beyond the current year, possibly a typo or outdated comment, but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code correctness:** The code is straightforward and matches the description. The __version__ string is statically assigned.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None of the reports find any malicious intent, code obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Data flow:** No untrusted sources or sinks; static assignment only.\n- **Obfuscation:** Not present.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** None detected.\n\n### Scores:\n- All reports assign malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0, which is appropriate.\n- Confidence scores are high (1 or 0.9), reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n- The only minor point is the copyright year (2025), which might suggest a typo but does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- **Are the reported issues present?** Yes, the code is exactly as described: a static version string assignment.\n- **Errors or flaws in the reports?** No, all reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- **Scores appropriateness:** The assigned scores are reasonable. Since there's no malicious or obfuscated code, malware and obfuscated scores should remain 0.\n- **Risk score justification:** Since the code is a simple, static assignment with no external dependencies or data flow, the overall security risk should be 0.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities:** The reports do not assume vulnerabilities beyond the static assignment, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a standard, benign version declaration with no security risks, malicious intent, or obfuscation. The only point to note is the copyright year, which is likely a typo but not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate. The code is harmless, and the scores are appropriate. No changes are necessary.",
