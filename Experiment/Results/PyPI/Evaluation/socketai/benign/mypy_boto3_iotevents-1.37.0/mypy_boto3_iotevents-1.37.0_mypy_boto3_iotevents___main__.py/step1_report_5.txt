  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for a package providing information about boto3 IoTEvents and package version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv; writes package info and version to stdout using sys.stdout.write.",
  "sinks": "Writes output to stdout; no untrusted data sources or external sinks involved.",
  "flows": "If '--version' is in sys.argv, calls print_version() and outputs version info; otherwise, calls print_info() to output package details.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. Code is straightforward, with standard usage of sys and simple string output.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to print static information about a package and handles a command-line argument '--version' to display version info. No input validation issues, no external data fetching, and no dynamic code execution. It does not read untrusted data, connect to network resources, or perform any suspicious operations. The logic is simple, well-structured, and standard for CLI scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a benign CLI utility that outputs package information. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this code.",
