  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for a package that provides information about boto3 IoTEvents typings and version.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for input arguments, sys.stdout for output",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout for output data, no other sinks identified",
  "flows": "Input argument '--version' triggers print_version, which outputs version info; otherwise, print_info outputs package details",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No unusual or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a simple CLI interface to display package info or version. It reads command-line arguments and outputs to stdout. No user input or untrusted data sources are used. The functions are straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no sensitive data handling. The code is well-structured, with clear separation of concerns. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility for displaying package information and version. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
