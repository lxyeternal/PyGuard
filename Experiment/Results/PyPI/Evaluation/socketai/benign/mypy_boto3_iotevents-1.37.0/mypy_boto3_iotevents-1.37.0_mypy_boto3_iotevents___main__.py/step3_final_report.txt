  "purpose": "Provides CLI commands to display package information and version details for a Python package.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv",
  "sinks": "Outputs static strings to stdout using sys.stdout.write",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--version' triggers print_version(), which outputs version; otherwise, print_info() outputs package info",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and uses only standard libraries",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal CLI utility that checks for '--version' argument and prints static package info or version. It uses only sys for input/output, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling beyond stdout. The logic is simple, with clear separation of functions. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The code's benign nature is confirmed by multiple reviews, all assigning zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, consistent with its straightforward design.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static CLI utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely to display package info and version, with no suspicious or malicious features detected.",
