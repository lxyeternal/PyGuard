  "purpose": "Provide CLI information about the package and its dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv). Writes package info and version info to stdout.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to stdout (console). No data is sent to external systems or network.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check (source) leads to output functions (sink). No untrusted data flow or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. Code is straightforward and purpose-specific.",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple CLI entrypoint that outputs package info or version based on arguments. It reads sys.argv for input and writes static strings to stdout. No external network communication, no embedded credentials, and no dynamic code execution are present. The code is well-structured, with clear purpose, and uses standard Python libraries only. No malicious or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI script with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It solely outputs static informational text based on command-line arguments.",
