  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review and Logical Consistency**:\n   - The code is a straightforward CLI utility that responds to the `--version` argument by printing the version, otherwise displays package info.\n   - It uses only standard Python libraries (`sys`) and outputs static strings.\n   - No dynamic code execution, external network access, file handling, or sensitive data processing is present.\n   - The code appears clean, well-structured, and purpose-specific.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues or Malicious Behavior**:\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign, with no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or external dependencies are detected.\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious, such as network connections, code injection, or data exfiltration.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Justification**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign a score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Security Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Any Discrepancies or Unreasonable Scores?**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and match the code's characteristics.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n5. **Potential Risks and Justifications**:\n   - The code is purely informational, with no malicious intent.\n   - The high confidence (1) score in reports aligns with the analysis.\n\n6. **Additional Observations**:\n   - The code does not include any hidden or obfuscated elements.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified; the code is intentionally simple.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is a minimal CLI utility for displaying package info and version, with no security issues or malicious features. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis assessment confirms that the code is safe and benign.",
