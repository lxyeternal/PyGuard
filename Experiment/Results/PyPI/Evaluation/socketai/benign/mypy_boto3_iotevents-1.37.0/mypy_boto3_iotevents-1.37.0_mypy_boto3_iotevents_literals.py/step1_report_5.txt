{
  "purpose": "Define type literals for iotevents service and various AWS service/resource/region names to facilitate type checking in Python code.",
  "sources": "Literal definitions and import statements, including conditional import of 'Literal' based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processing or external data output present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code solely establishes type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected. The code is purely declarative and static.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations via Literal type aliases for AWS-related string constants. It conditionally imports 'Literal' for compatibility with Python versions prior to 3.12, which is standard practice. No input/output handling, no dynamic execution, and no obfuscated or malicious code patterns are present. All content appears to be for static type checking and documentation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely defining type literals for use in type annotations. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. No signs of obfuscation or malware are evident.",
