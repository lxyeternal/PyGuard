{
  "purpose": "Defines type annotations using string literals for various AWS service and resource identifiers to facilitate type checking and validation.",
  "sources": "Literal definitions for service names, resource names, regions, and related types. These are static string values assigned via Literal annotations.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks are present. The code does not process or execute any external or untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks since all values are predefined string literals used solely for type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward type definition without any dynamic or obscure operations.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports the Literal type from either the standard typing module or typing_extensions, depending on Python version, then defines multiple type aliases as Literal of specific string values. It includes extensive lists of AWS service names, resource names, and regions, all statically assigned, aimed at providing type safety. The code is purely declarative with no runtime logic, input processing, or external interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static type definition module with no malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as a helper for type checking and does not perform any operations that could compromise security or leak information.",
