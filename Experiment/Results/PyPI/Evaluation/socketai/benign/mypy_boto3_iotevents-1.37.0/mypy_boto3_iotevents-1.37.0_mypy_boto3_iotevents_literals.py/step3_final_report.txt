  "purpose": "Static type alias definitions for AWS IoT Events and other AWS service literals, used for type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Definitions of string literals for service statuses, types, regions, and resource names, with conditional import for 'Literal' based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No data processing, external data input, or runtime data handling; purely static definitions.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow or external interactions present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward static type alias declarations.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type alias definitions using 'Literal' for various AWS service identifiers, statuses, regions, and resource names. It includes a conditional import for 'Literal' to maintain compatibility across Python versions. There are no dynamic behaviors, data flows, external inputs, or runtime logic. The code serves as a static documentation and type checking aid, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All observed signals indicate benign, declarative code intended for static analysis tools or SDKs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static module defining string literal types for AWS services and related identifiers. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, risk: 0, obfuscated: 0) are accurate and justified.",
