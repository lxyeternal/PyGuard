{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations for various string literal types related to AWS IoT Events service and other AWS services.",
  "sources": "Static string literals assigned to type variables; import statements for type annotations based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No dynamic data handling or untrusted input sources; no output or external data effects present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only assigns literal types and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. Use of conditional import based on Python version is standard. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides type aliases using Python's Literal for documentation and type checking purposes. It conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' depending on Python version. No data processing, input handling, network operations, or external interactions are present. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior are detected. The scope is purely static type annotations for SDK-related literals.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module defining string literal types for AWS service identifiers and states. It appears to be intended for type hinting and documentation, with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
