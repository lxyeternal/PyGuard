{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for use in type annotations related to AWS IoT Events and other AWS services.",
  "sources": "Constant string literals used for type annotations, imported modules (sys, typing, typing_extensions). No user input or external data sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could be executed or cause harm. The code solely defines types and constants.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the code only sets up type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code performs straightforward type alias definitions with no dynamic execution or data manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' depending on Python version, then declares a series of string literal types for various AWS service and resource identifiers. These are purely static type annotations. No user input, network communication, file I/O, or dynamic code execution occurs. The purpose is documentation and type checking support, with no malicious intent or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static set of type definitions for AWS service literals, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is used for type hinting purposes and contains no sensitive or exploitable elements.",
