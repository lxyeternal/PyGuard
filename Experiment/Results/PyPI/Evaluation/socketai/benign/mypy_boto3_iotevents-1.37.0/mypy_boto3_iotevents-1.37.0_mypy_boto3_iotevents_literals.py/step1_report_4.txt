{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for AWS IoT Events service and other AWS services, regions, and resource types for type annotations and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Literal definitions of string types, imported modules (sys and typing_extensions), and the module's own string literals.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only defines type aliases and imports, without any data processing, network operations, or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is purely declarative with no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and only involves type annotations. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for AWS service names, regions, and literal statuses for the IoT Events service. It conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, which is a common pattern for compatibility. No data inputs, outputs, or external data handling is implemented. The content is purely declarative, with no evidence of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of type aliases for documentation and type safety purposes. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It solely facilitates static typing and does not perform any runtime operations.",
