  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious code, logical correctness, and consistency with the original code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies that the code defines type annotations for AWS IoT Events and other AWS services, using static string literals and conditional import for `Literal`.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or external data handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The code is purely static type alias definitions.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate. The code is benign, with a malware score of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The report is accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, correctly describing static type definitions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or external interactions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious or malicious code detected. The code is straightforward.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate, with a malware score of 0.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The assessment is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes the static nature of the literal definitions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flow or external data processing.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The code is purely declarative.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Consistent, malware score of 0.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues, well-founded.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the code defines type literals with conditional import.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No runtime data handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is benign, with no malicious elements.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, correctly identified.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or untrusted data.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Consistent, malware score of 0.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** None. All reports correctly identify that the code is static type annotations with no malicious behavior.\n- **Logical & Reasoning Flaws:** None detected. All reports logically analyze the code as benign.\n- **Scores & Justification:**\n  - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n  - **Obfuscated Score:** 0, appropriate.\n  - **Risk Score:** All are 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\nGiven the thorough review, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is purely static type annotations for AWS service literals, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current reports and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign, static set of type alias definitions for AWS service identifiers, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate and justified.",
