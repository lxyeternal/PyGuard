  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: presence of issues, logical soundness, scores, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines static string literal types for AWS IoT Events and other AWS services, with no dynamic or external data handling.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is purely for static type annotations, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0, Obfuscated: 0 — all appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The report is accurate. No issues found.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is static type definitions with no external data or malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code is straightforward, with no dynamic execution or external dependencies.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0, Obfuscated: 0 — justified.\n- **Conclusion:** No concerns; the analysis is valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code provides static type aliases for AWS service identifiers, with extensive lists of literals.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent; the code is purely declarative, with no runtime logic or external interactions.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0, Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines type literals for AWS services and regions, with conditional import for Python version compatibility.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning correctly notes that the code is static and safe, with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0, Obfuscated: 0 — justified.\n- **Conclusion:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, focusing on static type alias definitions with no dynamic or external data handling.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent and accurate.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0, Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** None. All reports correctly identify that the code is static type alias definitions.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** The code does not perform any runtime operations, data processing, network communication, or contain any obfuscated or suspicious constructs. The scores of 0 are justified.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation is present; the code is straightforward.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear and static.\n- **Risk Score:** **0** — no security risk involved.\n\nThis code is a benign, static type definition module intended for type checking and documentation purposes within an SDK or codebase.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate and reasonable. No adjustments needed.",
