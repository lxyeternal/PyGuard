{
  "purpose": "Type definitions and data structures for the AWS IoT Events service, used for type checking and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Static type annotations, class definitions, and data structures; no external input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present; code strictly defines data types and schemas.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely specifies type structures without runtime logic or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns identified. The code uses conditional imports based on Python version but nothing unusual or malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of type definitions, TypedDict classes, and union types intended for static type checking. It includes conditional imports for compatibility with different Python versions. There is no runtime code execution, no data input/output handling, and no network or system calls. All content appears to be standard, well-structured type annotation code for a Python SDK or type hints system. No indications of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely static type definitions for the AWS IoT Events SDK, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a schema or data contract without any runtime or side-effect behavior.",
