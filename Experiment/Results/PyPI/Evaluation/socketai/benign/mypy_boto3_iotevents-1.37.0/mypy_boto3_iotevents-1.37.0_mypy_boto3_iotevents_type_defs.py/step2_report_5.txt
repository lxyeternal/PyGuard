  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of each report:**\n\n- **Report 1:**  \n  - Purpose: Type definitions for AWS IoT Events SDK.  \n  - Findings: No runtime logic, no external data handling, no secrets, no anomalies.  \n  - Conclusion: Pure static type annotations, no malicious intent.  \n  - Malware score: 0\n\n- **Report 2:**  \n  - Purpose: Type definitions for AWS IoT Events in Python.  \n  - Findings: No runtime data input/output, no external calls, no anomalies.  \n  - Conclusion: Straightforward static type definitions, no malicious behavior.  \n  - Malware score: 0\n\n- **Report 3:**  \n  - Purpose: Type annotations for AWS IoT Events SDK.  \n  - Findings: No executable code, no network operations, no suspicious patterns.  \n  - Conclusion: Standard type annotation module, no security risks.  \n  - Malware score: 0\n\n- **Report 4:**  \n  - Purpose: Type annotations for AWS IoT Events.  \n  - Findings: Static type definitions, no data input/output, no anomalies.  \n  - Conclusion: Benign, standard type definitions, no malicious intent.  \n  - Malware score: 0\n\n- **Report 5:**  \n  - Purpose: Type definitions for AWS IoT Events SDK.  \n  - Findings: No runtime logic, no external data processing, no anomalies.  \n  - Conclusion: Well-structured, benign static type definitions.  \n  - Malware score: 0\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of malicious code or backdoors:**  \n  All reports explicitly mention that the code consists solely of static type definitions, TypedDict classes, conditional imports for compatibility, and no runtime logic or external interactions. There are no signs of obfuscated code, secrets, or malicious payloads.\n\n- **Code logic and data flow:**  \n  The code is purely declarative, serving as type annotations for static analysis. No data flows from untrusted sources, no network or file operations, no code execution.\n\n- **Anomalies or suspicious patterns:**  \n  No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n\n- **Use of conditional imports:**  \n  The conditional imports based on Python version are standard practice for compatibility and do not introduce security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware risk:**  \n  Given the comprehensive analysis and the explicit absence of any executable or malicious code, the malware score should remain **0**.\n\n- **Obfuscation:**  \n  The code is clear and straightforward; no obfuscation detected. Obfuscated score: **0**.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  Since there are no vulnerabilities, no malicious behaviors, and the code is purely static type definitions, the overall security risk score should be **very low**, ideally **0**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n**The provided code is a standard, well-structured set of static type definitions for the AWS IoT Events SDK. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. All scores are appropriately low.**\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the reports' findings.",
