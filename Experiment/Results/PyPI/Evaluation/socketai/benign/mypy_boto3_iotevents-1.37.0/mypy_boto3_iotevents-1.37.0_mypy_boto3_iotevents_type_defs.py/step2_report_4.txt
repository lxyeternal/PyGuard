  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Purpose & Nature**: All reports agree that the code consists solely of static type definitions, TypedDict classes, union types, and conditional imports for Python version compatibility. There are no functions, runtime logic, external calls, or data processing.\n\n2. **Data Flows & External Inputs**: No untrusted data sources, network activity, or external input handling is present. The code only defines data schemas for static type checking, serving as a contract or schema for the SDK.\n\n3. **Anomalies & Suspicious Patterns**: No hardcoded secrets, credentials, obfuscation, or backdoors are detected. The conditional imports based on Python version are standard practice for compatibility and do not introduce risks.\n\n4. **Malicious Indicators**: No signs of malware, malicious behavior, or sabotage are identified. The code is purely structural, aimed at type safety and clarity.\n\n5. **Scores & Justification**:\n   - **Malware Score**: Consistently zero across all reports. This is appropriate given the static, schema-only nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: Zero, as no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are present.\n   - **Risk Score**: Zero, since there are no runtime behaviors, data handling, or external interactions that could pose security risks.\n\n6. **Confidence & Consistency**: All reports are highly confident (score 1), and their conclusions align with the nature of the code.\n\n**Overall Evaluation**:\n- The code is a standard, well-structured set of static type definitions for the AWS IoT Events SDK.\n- There are no indications of malicious intent, security vulnerabilities, or obfuscation.\n- The conditional imports for Python version compatibility are common and benign.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate.\n- No changes needed; the code is safe and purely structural.\n\n**My personal assessment**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's nature.",
