{
  "purpose": "Type annotations for AWS IoT Events SDK data structures and configurations, serving as static type definitions for SDK development and documentation.",
  "sources": "Static class definitions, TypedDict declarations, union types, and conditional imports based on Python version; no runtime data input, external calls, or dynamic code execution.",
  "sinks": "None; code does not process or handle untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute runtime logic.",
  "flows": "N/A; purely static type definitions with no data flow or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static type annotations, standard conditional imports for compatibility, no secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static TypedDict classes, union types, and conditional imports for Python version compatibility. It serves as a schema or interface for the SDK, with no executable logic, data processing, or external interactions. No signs of malicious behavior, secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The conditional imports are standard practice and do not pose security concerns. The code's purpose is purely for static type checking and documentation, inherently posing no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely structural, and poses no security risks or malicious intent. All scores—malware, obfuscated, and overall risk—are appropriately zero.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
