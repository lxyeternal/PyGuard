{
  "purpose": "This code provides type annotations for the AWS IoT Events service, defining data structures and request/response types for the SDK.",
  "sources": "No input sources reading untrusted data; type definitions are static and not dynamic input sources.",
  "sinks": "No code executes external commands, writes data to untrusted sources, or uses data in a way that can be exploited maliciously.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow from sources to sinks; this code only defines types and data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code; usage of conditional imports for Python version compatibility appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is solely composed of type annotations using TypedDict and Union to define data structures for AWS IoT Events SDK. There are no executable statements, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The presence of license and documentation comments is benign. No suspicious or malicious patterns such as code injection, data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code adheres to standard practices for type hints in Python. The conditional imports for compatibility are normal and do not introduce risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a comprehensive set of static type definitions for an SDK, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard, well-structured type annotation module for AWS IoT Events.",
