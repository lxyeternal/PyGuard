  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the findings, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All reports describe the code as static type definitions for AWS IoT Events SDK in Python.\n- They emphasize the absence of runtime logic, data input/output handling, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- Conditional imports based on Python version are standard practice for compatibility.\n- The purpose is to facilitate static type checking, documentation, and SDK clarity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Logical Checks:\n\n- **Code content:** The code only contains class definitions (TypedDict), union types, and conditional imports. No functions, runtime logic, or external interactions are present.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of malicious code, such as backdoors, obfuscation, or data exfiltration.\n- **Secrets or credentials:** None are present.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation techniques.\n- **Anomalies:** The only notable aspect is the conditional import logic for Python version compatibility, which is standard and benign.\n\n### Scoring Justification:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malware or malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — purely static type definitions with no runtime or external interactions.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify the code as static type annotations serving as a schema or interface for SDK development.\n- The reasoning dismisses any security concerns appropriately, given the nature of the code.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is based on the code's static structure.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Based on the detailed review, I concur with the reports' conclusions.** The code is benign, serves as static type annotations, and poses no security risks.\n\n**My overall estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, well-structured set of static type definitions for the AWS IoT Events SDK in Python. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The reports are accurate and comprehensive.",
