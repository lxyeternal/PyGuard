{
  "purpose": "The code provides type definitions for the AWS IoT Events service in Python, used for type hinting and static analysis.",
  "sources": "The code sources include static type annotations, import statements for standard and external libraries, and type definitions with no runtime data input.",
  "sinks": "There are no runtime sinks, such as network connections, file writes, or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Type definitions flow internally within the code for static type checking; there are no data flows involving untrusted sources at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present. The code strictly defines types and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of TypedDict and Union type definitions for the AWS IoT Events service, with conditional imports based on Python version for compatibility. No functions, external calls, or dynamic execution are present. The absence of runtime logic, input handling, or external interactions suggests no malicious activity. The code appears to be straightforward type annotation code used for static analysis, with no embedded suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of type definitions for AWS IoT Events, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears to serve solely as a type hinting and documentation aid, with no malicious or security-related concerns.",
