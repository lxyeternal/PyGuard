  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of static type definitions, TypedDict classes, union types, and conditional imports for compatibility. There are no runtime behaviors, data processing, or external interactions. Therefore, no issues or vulnerabilities are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly note the absence of malicious code, secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:  \n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the static, benign nature of the code.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is correct; there's no obfuscation.  \n   - **Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of security risks.\n\n4. **Claims about Potential Vulnerabilities Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as purely static type annotations with no runtime or external data handling.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores with Content**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's nature—no malicious or obfuscated content, no runtime logic, and no security concerns.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations**:  \n   - The code uses conditional imports for compatibility, which is standard practice.  \n   - No embedded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are detected.  \n   - The purpose is solely for static type checking, which inherently reduces security risks.\n\n**Final Assessment**:  \nGiven the comprehensive analysis, the code is a standard, benign set of type definitions for the AWS IoT Events SDK. The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should all remain at **0**.\n\n**My own estimates** after careful review:  \n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's actual content.",
