  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of static type definitions, TypedDict classes, union types, and conditional imports for Python version compatibility. There are no runtime behaviors, data processing, or external interactions. No issues such as hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscation are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly state that the code is purely static, with no malicious intent or security risks. No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:  \n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of any malicious code or behavior.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is correct as there's no obfuscation.\n   - **Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, aligning with the fact that this is static type definition code with no security concerns.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores**:  \n   Since the code is purely static and has no runtime or external interactions, higher risk scores are unwarranted. The reports' assessments are justified.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions. They recognize the code's purpose as type annotations and data schemas, with no indication of malicious intent.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores and Analysis**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis. No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Systematic Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0\n\n### Overall Justification:\n\n- The code is a standard, well-structured set of static type definitions for the AWS IoT Events SDK.  \n- No runtime logic, external calls, or data handling that could pose security risks.  \n- No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious patterns detected.  \n- Conditional imports are common for compatibility and do not introduce security concerns.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. The code poses no security risks, malware, or obfuscation concerns.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate**:  \n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
