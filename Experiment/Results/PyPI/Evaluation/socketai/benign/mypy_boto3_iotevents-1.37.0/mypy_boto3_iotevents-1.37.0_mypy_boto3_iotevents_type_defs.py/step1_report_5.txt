  "purpose": "Define type annotations for AWS IoT Events service structures to facilitate type checking and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Static type definitions using TypedDict, imports from sys, datetime, and typing modules, and external literals.",
  "sinks": "No runtime data inputs or outputs; no user input handling or data processing that could be exploited.",
  "flows": "Type annotations serve for static analysis; no dynamic data flow or untrusted data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or backdoors; no suspicious code behavior. The code strictly defines types and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides structured type definitions for AWS IoT Events, using standard Python typing features and conditional imports for compatibility. It avoids executing or processing untrusted data. No code injection, external calls, or dynamic code execution is present. The import statements, type definitions, and constant declarations are all typical for a schema definition module. No malicious or obfuscated logic identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of type definitions for AWS IoT Events SDK, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
