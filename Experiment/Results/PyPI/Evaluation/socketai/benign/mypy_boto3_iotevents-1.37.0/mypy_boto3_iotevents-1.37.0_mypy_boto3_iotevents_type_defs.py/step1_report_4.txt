{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for the AWS IoT Events service in Python, facilitating type safety and clarity in SDK usage.",
  "sources": "Reading module imports, sys.version_info for version checks, and static data definitions within TypedDict classes.",
  "sinks": "No dynamic or untrusted data sinks are present; data is statically defined or passed as parameters.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; mainly static type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden behaviors; the code is purely type annotation definitions and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily contains type annotations using TypedDict, Union, and conditional imports based on Python version. No runtime code execution, input handling, or network activity is present. All imports are standard or conditional for type support. No obfuscated or malicious code constructs are detected. The code appears to be a standard type definition module for SDK purposes, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward, standard Python module for type annotations in an AWS SDK context. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The risk score is very low, and confidence is high.",
