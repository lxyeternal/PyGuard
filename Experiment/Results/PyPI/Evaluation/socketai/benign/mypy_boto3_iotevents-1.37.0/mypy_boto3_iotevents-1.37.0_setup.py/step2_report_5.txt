  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the scores, logic, and consistency.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the script as a standard Python setup configuration for a package.\n- No dynamic data, external inputs, or network operations are involved.\n- The code reads a local README.md file and sets static metadata.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present.\n- The code is consistent across reports, and all identify the script as benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Malware score:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk score:** 0.0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No malicious or obfuscated code, no security risks. The reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No issues identified; reasoning aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The analysis is consistent; no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is a typical setup script with no risks.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No suspicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Justification:**\n\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly assign a score of 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports correctly assign 0, as the code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the script.\n\n**Potential for higher scores?**  \nNo, because the code is purely a standard setup script with no signs of vulnerabilities, malicious activity, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.0\n\nThe reports are accurate, consistent, and justified. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a safe, standard Python package setup script with no security concerns. The assessments and scores are appropriate.",
