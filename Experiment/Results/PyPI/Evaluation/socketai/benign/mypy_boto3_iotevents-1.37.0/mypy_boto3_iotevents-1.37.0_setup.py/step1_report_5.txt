  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'mypy-boto3-iotevents', intended to package and distribute type annotations for the boto3 IoTEvents service.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for the long description; reads package metadata and configuration details within the setup() function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data is sent or written insecurely based on the script.",
  "flows": "Reads external file (README.md) for long description; uses static package metadata for setup; no dynamic or untrusted data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code present. The script uses only standard setup procedures and static data.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, reads a markdown file for description, and calls setuptools.setup() with static metadata. All data and parameters are hardcoded or sourced from local files. No code injection, network activity, or dynamic execution is present. The code performs typical package setup functions without any suspicious modifications or obfuscated parts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious behavior detected. It adheres to normal packaging conventions and does not perform any risky operations.",
