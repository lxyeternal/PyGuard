  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-iotevents, defining package metadata and configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data sinks; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow; static metadata used in setup().",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static code with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package setup script that imports 'setuptools', reads a local README file, and calls 'setup()' with static metadata. It contains no dynamic code, user input, network activity, or obfuscated elements. The script is typical for packaging Python modules and does not include any secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. All signals indicate a benign, well-formed configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly assign zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and risk, which aligns with the static and straightforward nature of the code.",
