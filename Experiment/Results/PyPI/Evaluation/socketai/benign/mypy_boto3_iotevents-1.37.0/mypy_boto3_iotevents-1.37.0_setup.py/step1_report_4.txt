{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to set up and configure the Python package 'mypy-boto3-iotevents' for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; importing setuptools for package setup; defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; setup parameters are hardcoded and do not process external input.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from sources to sinks; setup data is static and predefined.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, importing only necessary modules, reading a local README.md file, and passing static metadata to 'setup()'. There are no indications of malicious intent, external data handling, or suspicious behavior. All package information appears legitimate, and no secret or sensitive information is embedded.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, malicious dependencies, or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate.",
