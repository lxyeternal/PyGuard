  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code presence of issues:**  \n   All reports agree that the code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package. It reads a README file, defines package metadata, and calls `setup()`. No dynamic code, user input, or external data processing is involved.  \n   **Conclusion:** No issues or malicious code are present.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify the code as standard, static, and benign. No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - **Malware score:** All reports assign 0.0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.  \n   - **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0.0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.  \n   - **Risk score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is appropriate given the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**  \n   None of the reports suggest any risk higher than 0.5, and the code is clearly a standard setup script. Therefore, no justification for higher scores is necessary.\n\n5. **Malware considerations:**  \n   The code does not perform any suspicious actions—no code injection, network activity, or malicious payloads. The malware score of 0.0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports are cautious and base their conclusions on static analysis, with no assumptions about hidden behaviors. They correctly identify the code as safe.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's actual behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0.0** — no malicious activity detected.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.0** — code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Risk score:** **0.0** — no security risks identified.\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe code is a standard, benign Python package setup script. It performs no suspicious operations, contains no secrets, and does not execute any untrusted data. All evidence points to a safe and legitimate package configuration.\n\n**Therefore, I agree with the existing scores and see no reason to adjust them.**",
