  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script for a Python package, performing typical operations such as importing modules, reading a README file, and calling `setup()` with static metadata.\n   - No untrusted data sources, dynamic code execution, or network operations are present.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious payloads.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and thorough; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident in the analysis.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0.0\n     - Obfuscated: 0.0\n     - Security Risk: 0.0\n   - These are appropriate given the benign nature of the script.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all assessments indicate no malicious activity or vulnerabilities, there is no justification for higher risk scores.\n   - The code is a standard setup script, with no suspicious behaviors.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign malware as 0.0.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, so this score is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No questionable assumptions are made; the reports are based on static code analysis and standard security considerations.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n**Final Expert Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — No malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 — No security risks identified.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a typical, benign Python package setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The reports are accurate and comprehensive.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nMaintain the current scores; they accurately reflect the analysis. No further action needed.",
