  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-iotevents package to configure its installation and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads the __file__ path to load README.md; no external input sources; static metadata and dependencies defined within the script.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing; no external data or user input handling; no network or file operations other than reading static files.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the script only performs static configuration and file reading without any data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors detected. The code is a standard Python setup script with proper use of Path and setuptools.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, reads a README.md file for long description, and calls setup() with project metadata, dependencies, and URLs. All operations are static and typical for a setup script. There are no indications of code injection, malicious behavior, or security issues. No dynamic code execution, external data processing, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard setup configuration script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It solely performs package setup tasks without external input handling or malicious behaviors.",
