  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the code, reasoning, and scores, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** The code is a simple wrapper that imports a class and exposes it, with documentation. The only anomaly is the future copyright date (2025).\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Both are 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 is very low, consistent with the minimal code involved.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is sound; no malicious behavior or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, straightforward class import and aliasing with documentation. No external data or suspicious logic.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0, security risk is 0, matching the benign analysis.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same pattern, no suspicious behavior, just module setup.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated at 0, security risk at 0.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Correct assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same as above, with mention of the future date (2025). The date is unusual but not malicious.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated at 0, security risk at 0.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same as previous, no malicious behavior. The future date is noted as a possible typo or placeholder.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated at 0, security risk at 0.1 (slightly higher but still negligible).\n\n- **Conclusion:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. Given the code's simplicity and lack of network, code execution, or data manipulation, malware score should remain at **0**.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign **0**, which is correct; there's no obfuscation or code hiding.\n\n- **Risk Score:** All are very low (0 or 0.1). The minimal risk is justified since the code is just an interface wrapper with no security-sensitive operations.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n\n- The only anomaly is the future copyright year (2025). While unusual, it does not impact security or functionality.\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (keeping the minimal risk score for the unusual date, but it could be lowered to 0 if desired)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Overall Estimated Scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (or 0 if considering the date anomaly as non-security relevant)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, with no security concerns.",
