{
  "purpose": "To provide an interface for interacting with the AWS IoT Events service through a client class, including usage instructions and documentation links.",
  "sources": "Imports the IoTEventsClient class from a local module; no external data sources or input reading present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling points identified; code does not process external input or output data.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as there are no data flow paths involving untrusted sources; the code only defines references and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed; standard class import and aliasing pattern used.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a module-level interface with a documentation link, usage example, and an alias assignment for the IoTEventsClient class. It imports the client class from a local module and exposes it under a standardized name. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or data leaks. The code is straightforward and typical for a client SDK interface.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard, benign interface for the AWS IoT Events SDK, containing no malicious behavior or security risks. It simply exposes the client class and provides usage guidance.",
