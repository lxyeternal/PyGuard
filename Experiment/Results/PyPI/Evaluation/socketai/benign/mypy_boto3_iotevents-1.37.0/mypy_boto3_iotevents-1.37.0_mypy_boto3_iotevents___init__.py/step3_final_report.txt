  "purpose": "Main interface for AWS IoT Events service client, providing documentation and usage example.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or untrusted input; imports a local class.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external effects; static code.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow or untrusted data handling present.",
  "anomalies": "Future copyright year set to 2025, which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports a class and exposes it via a variable and in __all__. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or data processing. The only anomaly is the future date, which is likely a placeholder or typo. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The high confidence scores are justified. The minor date anomaly does not impact security or functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security risk or malware threat. The only minor anomaly (future date) does not affect security. The scores should remain at malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0, with confidence=1.",
