{
  "purpose": "Provides a main interface for the AWS IoT Events service, primarily exporting the IoTEventsClient class for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports IoTEventsClient from a local module (.client). No external input or data reading present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code is mainly exporting a class.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected. The copyright year is in the future (2025), which may be an inconsistency but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a module that imports a class from a local file and re-exports it for client usage. It contains documentation and a usage example. There are no external inputs, data processing, or network operations. No obfuscated code, malicious logic, or security issues are present. The only notable point is the future copyright year, which is likely a typo or placeholder.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward interface module for AWS IoT Events. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The only minor concern is the unusual copyright year, but it does not affect security.",
