  "purpose": "Provide the main interface for the iotevents service client, including documentation and exporting the client class.",
  "sources": "Import statement for IoTEventsClient from a relative module.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code mainly sets up module exports.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a copyright date set in the future (2025), which may be suspicious, but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a module for interfacing with the AWS IoT Events service, importing the IoTEventsClient class, and setting up module exports. The documentation string includes a link and example usage, but no executable code or network activity is present. The future date in the copyright notice is unusual but not inherently malicious. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard interface module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It primarily provides documentation and exports a client class for use elsewhere.",
