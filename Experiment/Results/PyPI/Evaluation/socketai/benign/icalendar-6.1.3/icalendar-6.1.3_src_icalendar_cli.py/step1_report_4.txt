  "purpose": "Utility program to preview and display calendar events from iCalendar files in a human-readable format.",
  "sources": "Reading input calendar files specified as command-line arguments; reading file contents using open().",
  "sinks": "None explicitly found; no data is written to untrusted locations other than user-specified files or stdout.",
  "flows": "File content read from specified calendar files -> parsed with Calendar.from_ical() -> event data processed and formatted for output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no network operations, no suspicious data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily reads user-provided files, parses calendar data, and formats it for display. It does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration. All functions operate on local data and produce formatted output. There are no apparent backdoors, malicious payloads, or malicious behaviors within the code. Usage of the icalendar library appears standard and safe. The code is well-structured for its purpose and lacks any suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward calendar preview utility with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It reads input files, processes data, and outputs human-readable summaries. No suspicious or malicious code observed.",
