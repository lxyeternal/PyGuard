  "purpose": "Utility program for previewing calendar events from iCalendar files.",
  "sources": "Reading input calendar files from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "Writing formatted calendar event summaries to output stream.",
  "flows": "Reads calendar files -> Parses with icalendar -> Processes events -> Outputs formatted event details.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of standard libraries and well-known third-party 'icalendar'.",
  "analysis": "The script processes input files specified via command-line arguments, reads their content, and parses iCalendar data. It formats event details for human readability. The code does not perform any network operations, execute code dynamically, or access environment variables insecurely. There are no indications of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. Usage of standard libraries and straightforward logic reduces suspicion. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for viewing calendar event data. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It operates solely on local files and produces human-readable output. Therefore, the overall security risk is very low.",
