  "purpose": "Utility program to preview and display calendar events from iCalendar files in a human-readable format.",
  "sources": "File input from specified calendar files, data read via open() with UTF-8 encoding, and iCalendar parsing via icalendar.Calendar.from_ical().",
  "sinks": "Output written to stdout or a specified output file using write(). No data is sent over network or written to external systems.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reads into the Calendar object, then through the view() function which processes event data, and finally outputs as formatted text to the output stream.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, no hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution observed. The code primarily parses and formats calendar data.",
  "analysis": "The script reads calendar files, parses them using the icalendar library, and formats event details for display. All inputs are file-based and from trusted sources, with no external network activity or untrusted data execution. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or backdoors. The library used is a standard open-source calendar parsing package, and the code functions mainly as a formatter and viewer. No suspicious data leaks, credential handling, or system manipulation present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for viewing calendar data with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It handles input files securely, does not perform any network or system modifications, and contains no suspicious behaviors.",
