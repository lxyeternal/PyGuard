  "purpose": "Utility program that reads and displays human-readable summaries of calendar events from .ics files.",
  "sources": "Reading input files specified via command-line arguments; parsing file contents with the 'icalendar' library.",
  "sinks": "Outputting formatted event summaries to stdout or specified output file.",
  "flows": "File input -> parsing with 'icalendar' -> extracting event details -> formatting -> output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and uses standard libraries without suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code reads local calendar files, parses them using a trusted library, and outputs formatted summaries. It does not perform network activity, dynamic code execution, or access sensitive environment variables. The logic is clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs. The 'icalendar' library is well-known and trusted. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. Potential risks could arise from maliciously crafted input files exploiting parsing vulnerabilities, but this is outside the scope of the code itself. Overall, the code is a simple, safe utility with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward calendar viewer utility with no malicious behavior or security issues. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk are justified and appropriate.",
