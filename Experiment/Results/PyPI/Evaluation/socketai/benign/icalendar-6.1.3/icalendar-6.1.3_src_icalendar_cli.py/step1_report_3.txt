  "purpose": "Utility program to preview and display human-readable summaries of calendar events from iCalendar (.ics) files.",
  "sources": "Reads input calendar files specified as command-line arguments, opens and reads their contents.",
  "sinks": "Writes the formatted calendar event summaries to standard output or specified output file.",
  "flows": "Reads calendar file content -> Parses into Calendar object -> Iterates over events -> Formats and outputs event details.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. No suspicious network activity or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward parsing and formatting of iCalendar data. It reads files provided via command-line arguments, processes calendar events, and outputs readable summaries. No external network connections, no data exfiltration, and no modifications to system files are present. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code relies on a third-party library ('icalendar') for parsing, which is standard and not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets, environment variables, or unsafe operations are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign utility for displaying calendar event information. There are no indications of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks within the provided code. It solely reads calendar files, formats data, and outputs it without any side effects or suspicious activities.",
