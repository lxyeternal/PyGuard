  "purpose": "Utility functions for encoding and decoding Unicode and byte data, primarily for handling ICAL data types and converting data structures to encoded formats.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for functions (`value`, `data`, `encoding`), `data` parameter in `data_encode`.",
  "sinks": "Encoding (`encode`, `decode`) functions that process data, potential return points of encoded/decoded data.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into encoding/decoding functions, which then produce encoded or decoded output. Data structures are recursively processed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code observed. The code is straightforward utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides functions to convert data between unicode and bytes, handling Unicode errors gracefully. It recursively encodes data structures (dicts, lists, tuples) to the specified encoding. No external data is fetched or sent, and no suspicious behaviors or malicious activities are present. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are detected. The functions follow standard encoding practices with exception handling for encoding errors.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be standard utility functions for encoding and decoding data, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured and straightforward, with no suspicious behaviors or anomalies.",
