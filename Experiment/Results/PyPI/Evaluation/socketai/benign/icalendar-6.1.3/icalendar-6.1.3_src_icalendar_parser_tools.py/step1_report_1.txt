{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for encoding and decoding Unicode and byte data, mainly for data processing and conversions.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters: value (ICAL_TYPE), data (Union[ICAL_TYPE, dict, list]), encoding parameters.",
  "sinks": "Return statements converting data to bytes or strings, potentially returning input data unaltered.",
  "flows": "Input data is checked for type; if string or bytes, it's encoded/decoded; otherwise, returned as-is, or recursively processed in data_encode.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. Functions handle data conversions securely. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. No suspicious network activity or file manipulations.",
  "analysis": "The functions perform straightforward data type checks and conversions between strings and bytes, with exception handling for encoding/decoding errors. Recursive encoding for data structures like dicts and lists is implemented correctly. No obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious behavior present. No external data fetching, no environment variable misuse, no unsafe SQL, or code injection points identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard utility functions for encoding and decoding data, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and benign, intended for data processing tasks.",
