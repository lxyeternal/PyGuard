  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting between unicode strings and bytes, and recursively encoding data structures to a specified encoding.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions: 'value' in from_unicode and to_unicode, 'data' in data_encode; type checks within functions.",
  "sinks": "Return statements after encoding/decoding; recursive calls in data_encode.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through type checks, encoding/decoding with exception handling, and recursive processing of data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward implementation; minor point that non-str/bytes inputs are returned unaltered, which is acceptable for utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides safe, standard data conversion utilities with proper error handling. No external resource access, network activity, or dynamic code execution. Functions are well-structured, with clear type checks and recursion. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present. The functions handle errors gracefully and perform expected conversions. The code is benign, with no security vulnerabilities or malicious intent. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are justified and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard utility module for data encoding and decoding, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The existing reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
