  "purpose": "Utility functions for encoding and decoding between unicode and bytes, and encoding data structures to a specific encoding.",
  "sources": "Input parameters of functions: value, data, encoding; data structures passed into data_encode.",
  "sinks": "Return statements providing encoded/decoded data; recursive calls within data_encode that process input data.",
  "flows": "Input data -> type checks -> encoding/decoding -> return; data structures recursively processed to encode all elements.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior observed. No use of unsafe evaluation, network, or file system operations.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides utility functions for encoding and decoding between unicode and bytes, handling data structures recursively. No external resource access, network activity, or suspicious behavior is present. The functions perform standard encoding/decoding with exception handling for unicode errors. No anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard, safe utility functions for data encoding and decoding. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks identified.",
