  "purpose": "Provide utility functions to convert data between unicode and bytes, and encode data structures to a specified encoding.",
  "sources": "Input data passed to from_unicode, to_unicode, and data_encode functions.",
  "sinks": "Encoding and decoding operations that process data, but no external data sinks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through type checks and conversions, ending with encoded data or re-encoded strings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for type-safe conversions between unicode and bytes, supporting various data structures. It includes exception handling for encoding/decoding errors. The functions are straightforward, without any network activity, file I/O, or suspicious logic. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns are detected. Usage of standard Python functions and type hints suggest an intentional utility implementation. The code appears benign and intended for data processing within legitimate applications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions for data conversion and encoding, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It operates solely on data transformations, adhering to expected behavior.",
