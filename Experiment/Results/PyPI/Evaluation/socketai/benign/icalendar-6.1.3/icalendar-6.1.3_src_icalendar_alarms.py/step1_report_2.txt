{
  "purpose": "The code computes and manages alarm times and states based on calendar components such as events and todos, considering various calendar software behaviors and RFC 9074 specifications.",
  "sources": "Reads calendar components (Event, Todo, Alarm) and their properties such as TRIGGER, ACKNOWLEDGED, X-MOZ-LASTACK, X-MOZ-SNOOZE-TIME, DTSTAMP, and local timezone information.",
  "sinks": "Generates AlarmTime objects with trigger times and acknowledgment states; no data is written or sent to external systems or networks.",
  "flows": "Reads alarm properties → computes alarm trigger times considering relative and absolute triggers → evaluates acknowledgment and snooze statuses → outputs AlarmTime objects with their active states.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of type checking imports and timezone handling is standard. No obfuscated language features or unnecessary dynamic execution. The code is structured and documented clearly.",
  "analysis": "The code focuses on calculating alarm trigger times based on calendar components, acknowledging different software behaviors. It handles time zones, acknowledges, snoozes, and relative alarms, raising exceptions if required information is missing. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is evident. The inclusion of detailed comments and exception handling appears legitimate and intended for robust calendar alarm management.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate calendar alarm management library implementing RFC 9074. It correctly handles various acknowledgment and snooze features across different calendar clients without any malicious or sabotage intent. There are no signs of malware or malicious data handling. It is safe for use.",
