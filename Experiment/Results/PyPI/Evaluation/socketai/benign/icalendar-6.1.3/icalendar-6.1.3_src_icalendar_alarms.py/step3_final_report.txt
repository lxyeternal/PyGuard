{
  "purpose": "This code manages and computes alarm times for calendar components, considering platform-specific behaviors, acknowledgments, snoozes, and RFC 9074 standards.",
  "sources": "Properties such as TRIGGER, ACKNOWLEDGED, X-MOZ-LASTACK, X-MOZ-SNOOZE-TIME, and component start/end times.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not perform network, file, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Source properties (e.g., TRIGGER, ACKNOWLEDGED) flow into alarm time calculations, acknowledgment, snooze handling, and active alarm filtering.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured implementation of calendar alarm processing, handling absolute, start-relative, and end-relative alarms, with proper exception handling for incomplete data. It does not contain obfuscation, network activity, or malicious routines. The logic aligns with RFC 9074 and platform-specific behaviors. No signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, safe, and free from malware or obfuscation. It functions as intended for calendar alarm management without security concerns.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
