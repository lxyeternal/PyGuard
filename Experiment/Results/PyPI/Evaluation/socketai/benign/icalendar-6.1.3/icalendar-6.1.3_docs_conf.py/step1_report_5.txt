{
  "purpose": "Configure the documentation build process for the icalendar project using Sphinx.",
  "sources": "Import statements (importlib.metadata, datetime, os); environment variables (READTHEDOCS); dynamic version retrieval (importlib.metadata.version).",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is used in a way that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Environment variable READTHEDOCS influences theme selection; importlib.metadata retrieves package version; datetime provides current year for copyright.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. The code performs standard configuration and environment checks.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up Sphinx documentation configuration, importing standard modules for environment detection, versioning, and date. It dynamically chooses themes based on environment variables, retrieves package version info, and sets documentation parameters. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is present. No external connections, network activity, or sensitive data handling beyond standard configuration steps.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical configuration script for building project documentation with Sphinx. It does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior. The code is safe and straightforward.",
