  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard Sphinx configuration script.\n- No untrusted data is processed or transmitted.\n- No external system modifications, network activity, or malicious code are present.\n- The code uses standard libraries, environment variables, and conditional imports appropriately.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The only minor point is the benign warning print when a theme module isn't installed, which is standard practice.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  No. All reports agree that the code is benign and standard. No malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or anomalies are detected.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No. The code is well-structured, follows best practices, and contains no logical errors or security flaws.\n\n- **Scores assigned?**  \n  All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the analysis.  \n  Obfuscated score is 0, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Risk scores > 0.5?**  \n  None. All are 0, justified by the benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Malware score justification?**  \n  Zero, as no malicious activity is present or implied.\n\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities?**  \n  No assumptions are made beyond standard configuration practices; all are confirmed safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a typical, well-structured configuration script for building documentation with Sphinx. It does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute any code that could be malicious. The environment variable usage is safe, and optional theme import handling is benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- **The code is entirely benign.**\n- **No security risks or malware are present.**\n- **Scores are appropriate and justified.**\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nKeep the current scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk. No adjustments needed.",
