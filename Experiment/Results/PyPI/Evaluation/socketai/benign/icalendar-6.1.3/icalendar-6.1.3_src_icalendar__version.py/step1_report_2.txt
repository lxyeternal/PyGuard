  "purpose": "Define version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools-scm",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version strings and tuples",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external interactions",
  "flows": "N/A; straightforward variable assignments",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is simple and standard for version definition",
  "analysis": "The code sets version-related variables (__version__, version, __version_tuple__, version_tuple) with static values. It includes a TYPE_CHECKING block for type hints but does not execute any external or untrusted input. The structure is typical for package versioning and contains no suspicious logic or behavior. No obfuscated code, no external data sources, no dynamic code execution. The purpose is purely to define version info, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version definition snippet generated by setuptools-scm. There are no malicious behaviors, no malicious code, and no security risks detected.",
