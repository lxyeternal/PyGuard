  "purpose": "This code provides static version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools-scm, and contains no dynamic or external data handling.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuples, static variables set at module load time.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or external inputs are processed.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignments without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, auto-generated version info module with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static module defining version variables, generated automatically. It uses standard Python constructs, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or external data handling. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors are present. The use of TYPE_CHECKING for type hints is standard and does not introduce security issues. Overall, the code is benign and serves a version management purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated version info module with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
