  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine if their conclusions are justified based on the code.\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n- The code is a standard, auto-generated version info module.\n- It contains static variable assignments for version data.\n- No dynamic code, external input, or data processing.\n- No obfuscation, no suspicious constructs.\n- The use of TYPE_CHECKING is typical for type hints and does not introduce security issues.\n- The comments explicitly state that it is auto-generated by setuptools-scm.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify that the code is static, benign, and standard for version management.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  No. The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n\n- **Scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, security risk)?**  \n  All reports assign scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Any claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \n  No. All reports correctly state that there are no external data flows, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n- The **malware score of 0** is justified; there's no malicious activity.\n- The **obfuscated score of 0** is justified; code is straightforward and readable.\n- The **security risk score of 0** is justified; no vulnerabilities or security issues are present.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent with the code and analysis.\n- No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign, straightforward, and free of malicious or obfuscated content. The assigned scores are appropriate, and there are no assumptions or claims that need challenging. The code poses no security threat.\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \n- Malware score: **0**  \n- Obfuscated score: **0**  \n- Risk score: **0**",
