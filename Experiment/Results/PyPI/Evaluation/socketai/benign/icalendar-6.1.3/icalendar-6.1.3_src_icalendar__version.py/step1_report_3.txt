  "purpose": "Define and initialize version information for a Python package generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuples, conditional import statements for type checking.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code only defines static variables.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; static data is assigned directly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard versioning assignments.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets version variables for a package, including handling for type checking. It defines version strings and tuples with hardcoded values. There are no dynamic inputs, external data reads, or suspicious operations. The code is minimal, clean, and adheres to common patterns used in package versioning. No obfuscated or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This source code contains only static version definitions and type-checking scaffolding. It poses no security threat, does not contain malicious behavior, and is standard for version management in Python packages.",
