  "purpose": "This code defines version-related variables for a Python package generated by setuptools-scm, used for version management and distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only assigns static string and tuple values to version variables.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the version strings are statically assigned and not influenced by external input.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious or unusual constructs. The comment indicates it is auto-generated, and no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward auto-generated version declaration for a Python package, with no external data input or unsafe operations. The variables are statically assigned, and there is no indication of malicious behavior. The structure is standard and simple, with no dynamic execution or obfuscation. It uses conditional type checking, which is common for type hints and does not introduce security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as version metadata for a package. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. Its purpose is solely to define version information in a clear and static manner.",
