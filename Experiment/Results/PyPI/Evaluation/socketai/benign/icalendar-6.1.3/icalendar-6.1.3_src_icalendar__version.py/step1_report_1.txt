{
  "purpose": "Define version information for the package using static variables, primarily for version management and type checking.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string '__version__' and tuple '__version_tuple__' assignments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; static data assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no obfuscated code, no hardcoded credentials beyond version info, and no dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets version variables using static assignments. It includes type hints conditioned on TYPE_CHECKING. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, and no sensitive data handling. The comments clarify that the file is auto-generated by setuptools-scm, with no intention of malicious behavior. The structure is simple and standard for version management. No anomalies, suspicious behaviors, or malicious code indicators are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, auto-generated version information module with no malicious intent or security issues. It merely defines version constants for package management purposes.",
