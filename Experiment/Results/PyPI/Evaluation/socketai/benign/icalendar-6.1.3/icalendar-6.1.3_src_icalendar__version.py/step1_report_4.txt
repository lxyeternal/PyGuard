{
  "purpose": "Defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuples, static string definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs, no data leaks, no external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow; static version data assigned to variables.",
  "anomalies": "Code includes a typical version definition pattern; no unusual code structures, no hardcoded secrets or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines version metadata for a Python package. It includes conditional type hinting setup and assigns fixed version strings and tuples. There are no external inputs, no data processing, no network activity, or potential for malicious behavior. The use of TYPE_CHECKING is standard for type hints. No suspicious constructs or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward version metadata declaration, typical for Python packages. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
