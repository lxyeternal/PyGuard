  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malware or malicious behavior. The only minor security concern is the non-cryptographic randomness in UID generation, which does not constitute a security risk for its intended purpose. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2 are appropriate and consistent."
