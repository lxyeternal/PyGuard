  "purpose": "The script generates and visualizes volumetric data using marching cubes algorithms for 3D surface extraction.",
  "sources": "Reads volumetric data from visvis library functions (vv.volread, vv.aVolume, ellipsoid) and internal functions for generating data (donuts).",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data outputs or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Reads volumetric data from visvis functions -> processes with marching_cubes functions -> visualizes using visvis display functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The use of internal visualization library functions is standard for visualization purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard scientific libraries, defines data generation and visualization functions, and executes visualization in the main block. It uses visvis for reading, generating, and visualizing volumetric data, with no external network communications, system modifications, or malicious code present. No obfuscated or suspicious code structures identified. The internal 'donuts' function creates volumetric data based on mathematical formulas without external dependencies or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate data visualization script for 3D volumetric data using marching cubes algorithms. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident, and the script's operations are typical for scientific visualization. There are no signs of malware, data exfiltration, or malicious code inclusion.",
