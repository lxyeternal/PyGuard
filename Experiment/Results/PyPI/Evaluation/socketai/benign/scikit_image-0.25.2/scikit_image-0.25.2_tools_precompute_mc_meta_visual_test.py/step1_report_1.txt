{
  "purpose": "The script visualizes the results of two marching cubes algorithms on different volumetric data sets for visualization and analysis purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads volumetric data from visvis functions (vv.volread, vv.aVolume), and generates test data via the donuts() function. No external untrusted input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "Uses visualization functions (vv.mesh, vv.figure) for rendering; no sinks that send data externally or perform network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from volumetric data sources into marching_cubes functions to generate meshes. The visualizations display these meshes. No data flows into untrusted sinks or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious payloads present. No code injection, data leakage, or unsafe operations identified.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard scientific libraries and a visualization library (visvis). It creates volumetric datasets, including a procedural 'donuts' dataset, and applies marching cubes algorithms to extract surface meshes. It visualizes results without any network communication or file manipulation beyond reading volumetric data. The functions and data flows appear legitimate, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate volumetric data visualization script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs data processing and visualization without external data leaks or harmful actions.",
