  "purpose": "Visualization of marching cubes algorithms on volumetric data, including external files and generated datasets.",
  "sources": "Trusted volumetric data sources ('stent' file, 'ellipsoid', 'donuts' function, internal data generation).",
  "sinks": "Visualization via 'visvis' library; no external network or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Data flows from internal or file-based sources into marching_cubes functions, then to visualization components.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard scientific libraries for visualization, processes data internally or from trusted files, and does not perform any network communication or malicious actions. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present. The data processing and visualization are straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate scientific visualization tool with no malicious or security concerns. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate, and the minimal security risk reflects the benign nature of the code.",
