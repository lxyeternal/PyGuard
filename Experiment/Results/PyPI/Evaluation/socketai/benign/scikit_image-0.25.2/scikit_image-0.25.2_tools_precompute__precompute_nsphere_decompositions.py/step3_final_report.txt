  "purpose": "Utility script for precomputing disk and sphere footprints (decompositions) for 2D and 3D morphological operations, optimizing approximations with minimal error.",
  "sources": "Reads parameters, internal functions, and libraries; no external untrusted data or network activity.",
  "sinks": "Writes precomputed footprint data to .npy files.",
  "flows": "Defines shapes and parameters -> iterates over radii -> computes desired footprints -> searches for optimal decompositions -> saves results.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external data leaks detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs geometric and morphological computations using standard libraries, with iterative optimization to approximate desired footprints. It contains no network calls, no obfuscated code, and no malicious logic. The purpose is scientific and utility-based, with straightforward data processing and file output.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, transparent utility for morphological footprint precomputation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security vulnerabilities. The code is safe, well-structured, and appropriate for its intended purpose.",
