{
  "purpose": "Utility script to precompute disk and sphere footprints for image processing, storing decompositions for later use.",
  "sources": "Reads data from skimage.morphology functions (disk, ball, footprint_from_sequence), and numpy arrays; no direct user input or external data sources are read.",
  "sinks": "Writes precomputed footprint decompositions to .npy files; no external network or system modification actions observed.",
  "flows": "Uses footprint_from_sequence to generate footprint arrays, compares them to desired shapes, and saves results to files based on the computed best values.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The code primarily performs computational geometry calculations and file I/O.",
  "analysis": "The script precomputes and stores footprint decompositions for 2D and 3D shapes. It involves iterations, comparisons, and selections based on error minimization, with file outputs. No network activity, system modifications, or obfuscated code observed. Functions used are from skimage, and numpy handles numerical operations. The code's logic is consistent with its intended purpose, and no malicious behavior or malware patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for precomputing morphological footprints in image processing. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The script is well-structured for its purpose and poses no security threat.",
