{
  "purpose": "The script precomputes and stores decompositions of disk and sphere footprints for image processing purposes, specifically for use with skimage morphology operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters such as 'ndims', 'radius_max_per_ndim', and 'strict_radius'. It also calls functions like 'footprint_from_sequence', 'disk', and 'ball', which may internally access data or system resources.",
  "sinks": "The code writes output to NumPy binary files (.npy) such as 'ball_decompositions.npy' and 'disk_decompositions.npy'. No untrusted data output or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> Function calls (e.g., 'disk', 'ball', 'footprint_from_sequence') -> Calculation and error evaluation -> Final best values stored and saved as .npy files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious hardcoded secrets. No obfuscated code, unnecessary dynamic execution, or misleading variables. The code appears straightforward, focusing on image footprint computations.",
  "analysis": "The script performs precomputation of footprint decompositions for 2D and 3D images, iterating over radii and sequences of geometric shapes. It uses functions from 'skimage.morphology' and internal functions to generate and evaluate footprints, then saves the optimal decompositions. The code structure and variable names are clear and consistent. There are no signs of malicious network activity, data exfiltration, or system harm. The only output is stored files that are relevant to its purpose. No suspicious behavior or malicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a utility for precomputing footprint decompositions in image processing, with no indications of malicious intent or harmful behavior. It safely reads input parameters, performs computations, and writes output files without external network activity or sensitive data leaks.",
