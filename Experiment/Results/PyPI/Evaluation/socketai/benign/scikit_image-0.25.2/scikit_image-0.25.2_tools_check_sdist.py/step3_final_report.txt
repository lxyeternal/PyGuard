  "purpose": "Verify the completeness of a source distribution tarball by checking for missing expected files.",
  "sources": "Reads the filename argument, tarball contents via tarfile, filesystem traversal with os.walk",
  "sinks": "Comparison of filenames from tarball against ignore lists and expected filenames",
  "flows": "Reads tarball filename -> extracts members -> compares filenames to ignore lists and expected files -> reports missing files",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; static ignore lists; straightforward logic",
  "analysis": "The code opens a tarball, retrieves its members, and compares the filenames against predefined ignore lists and expected filenames. It reports any missing files, which indicates the completeness of the source distribution. The code uses standard libraries and performs no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted data beyond file listing. The ignore lists are static and typical for build artifacts and documentation. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The logic is clear, deterministic, and aligned with common validation scripts. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0-0.1) are justified given the benign nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for verifying source distribution completeness. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
