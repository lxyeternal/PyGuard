  "purpose": "The script checks the contents of a source distribution (sdist) tarball against expected files, ensuring all necessary files are included.",
  "sources": "Input source: 'sdist_name' argument (tarball filename). Data read from tarfile and filesystem during directory traversal.",
  "sinks": "File system operations (os.walk, os.path.join), tarfile extraction, print statements, sys.exit.",
  "flows": "Input filename -> Open tarfile -> Retrieve members -> Directory traversal -> Compare filenames against expected list -> Output missing files or success message.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present. Uses standard library functions only. No suspicious external network activity or data exfiltration. The code is straightforward, serving a validation purpose.",
  "analysis": "The script safely opens and inspects a tarball, compares its contents with predefined expected files, and reports any discrepancies. It employs standard libraries and simple logic without executing untrusted code or interacting with external systems. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks. The logic is clear and typical for a build validation script.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign check of source distribution completeness. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It is a standard validation script with no suspicious elements.",
