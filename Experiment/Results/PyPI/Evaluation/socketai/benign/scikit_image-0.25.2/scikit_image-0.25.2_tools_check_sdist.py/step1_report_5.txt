{
  "purpose": "The script checks the contents of a source distribution (sdist) tarball to ensure all expected files are included, helping maintain source package integrity.",
  "sources": "Reads the sdist filename from command-line arguments; opens and reads the tar archive; iterates through archive members; walks the filesystem to identify missing files.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data, but potential for directory traversal if filenames are manipulated maliciously, though not evident here; output is only printed and exit codes.",
  "flows": "Reads sdist filename -> opens tar archive -> extracts member list -> compares with filesystem files -> outputs missing files list if any.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or hardcoded secrets. No dynamic code execution, network access, or obfuscated parts. The code is straightforward, focused on file verification.",
  "analysis": "The code performs archive inspection and file verification without any suspicious logic or malicious behavior. It does not process untrusted input beyond filename input and only outputs informational messages. No network, system manipulation, or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility to verify completeness of source distributions. It contains no malware or malicious intent, and the security risk is minimal. The code is clear and purpose-specific.",
