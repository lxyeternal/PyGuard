{
  "purpose": "The script generates symbolic expressions for central moments from raw moments in 2D or 3D, for use in image processing calculations.",
  "sources": "Imports from sympy (symbols, binomial, Sum, IndexedBase, Idx, pycode) and the defined loop variables and symbols for moments and centroid components.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs Python code strings to the console, which are not executed or written to files within this script. No external data or untrusted input handling is present.",
  "flows": "The script constructs symbolic expressions for moments, substitutes centroid values, converts expressions to Python code strings, and prints them.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious payloads detected. The code is straightforward symbolic computation for mathematical purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically creates symbolic formulas for central moments in 2D or 3D, depending on the 'ndim' variable. It uses sympy for symbolic algebra, summations, and binomial coefficients. The code only performs symbolic calculations and prints generated Python code snippets for later use. There are no network calls, data leaks, or system modifications. The substitution of centroid expressions is standard for calculating central moments. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, mathematically oriented symbolic computation script for generating code to calculate central moments. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks within this code. It is safe for use in a typical image processing or scientific computation context.",
