{
  "purpose": "Generate symbolic expressions for central moments from raw moments in 2D or 3D, used for image analysis in skimage.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are the symbolic definitions of moments (M) and the symbolic variables for centroids; the code reads these symbols to generate mathematical expressions.",
  "sinks": "Generated expressions are printed as Python code for subsequent use; no external data is read or written outside the generated code, and no network communication occurs.",
  "flows": "The code flows from defining moments and centroid variables, computing symbolic sums, substituting centroid expressions, and printing Python code snippets for central moments.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external calls are present. The code strictly performs symbolic mathematical derivations. No obfuscated code or malicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The script uses SymPy to create symbolic expressions for image moments, either in 2D or 3D. It computes central moments based on raw moments, performs symbolic summations, and substitutes centroid calculations. The code is straightforward, focusing on mathematical derivations. There are no external I/O operations, network activity, or potentially malicious behavior. The code appears to be a legitimate part of a scientific computing utility, with no signs of malware or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard symbolic mathematics script for deriving central moments in image analysis. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It’s a benign utility for generating mathematical expressions used elsewhere in the library.",
