{
  "purpose": "The code generates symbolic expressions for converting raw image moments to central moments in 2D or 3D space, useful for image analysis tasks.",
  "sources": "Reads symbolic definitions of moments (M), coordinate symbols (c_x, c_y, c_z), and loop indices (i, j, k). Uses the sympy library functions for symbolic computation.",
  "sinks": "Generates and prints Python code snippets for central moment calculations, with no apparent data leakage or insecure operations.",
  "flows": "Uses moment symbols and centroid calculations as sources; outputs Python code for moment computations as sinks; no untrusted data input or external data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code structures identified. The code uses symbolic mathematics to generate code snippets; no obfuscation or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The script employs sympy to compute symbolic expressions for central moments based on raw moments. It uses loops to generate these expressions for each order, substituting centroid calculations. The code's structure is straightforward, using sympy's Sum, binomial, and substitution features. No external inputs, network operations, or system modifications are present. The generated code is printed as text, intended for further use in the broader project, with no signs of malicious intent or covert behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for symbolic expression generation related to image moments. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. It performs mathematical computations to produce code snippets and has no evident security risks.",
