  "purpose": "Generate symbolic expressions for transforming raw moments into central moments in 2D or 3D, for use in image analysis.",
  "sources": "SymPy symbolic variables, binomial coefficients, and sums; M (moments matrix); substitution of moment ratios with centroid symbols.",
  "sinks": "Generated Python code snippets printed as strings for later use; no external data or system interaction.",
  "flows": "Symbolic sums and binomial calculations -> substitution of moment ratios -> string formatting for code snippets.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward symbolic mathematics.",
  "analysis": "The code uses SymPy to symbolically derive formulas for central moments in 2D/3D, performing sums, substitutions, and outputting code snippets. It contains no external data access, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The purpose is purely mathematical derivation and code generation, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for symbolic derivation of moments, with no malicious or security-threatening elements. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk) are accurate and consistent with the code's purpose and behavior.",
