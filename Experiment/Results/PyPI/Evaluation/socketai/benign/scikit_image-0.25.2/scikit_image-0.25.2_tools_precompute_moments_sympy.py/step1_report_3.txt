  "purpose": "Generate analytical expressions for transforming raw moments into central moments for 2D or 3D data, specifically used in skimage/measure/_moments_analytical.py.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters (ndim, order), symbolic definitions (symbols, M), and sympy functions for algebraic manipulation.",
  "sinks": "Outputs Python code strings for central moments calculations; no untrusted data sources or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Defines symbolic variables -> Performs algebraic sums -> Substitutes centroid symbols -> Converts expressions into Python code strings.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. No obfuscated code features. No dynamic code execution or suspicious external communications. Commented-out code is benign.",
  "analysis": "The script is a mathematical code generator that uses sympy to produce expressions for central moments based on raw moments. It only performs symbolic computations, summations, substitutions, and string formatting. There are no network operations, file I/O, or data exfiltration routines. The code is well-structured, with clear purpose, and does not contain hidden or suspicious logic. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard mathematical utility for symbolic derivation of moments, with no signs of malicious activity or malware. It operates solely within symbolic algebra and code generation, with no harmful side effects.",
