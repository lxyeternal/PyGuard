{
  "purpose": "The script generates symbolic expressions for transforming raw moments into central moments in image processing, specifically for 2D and 3D data, using SymPy.",
  "sources": "Reads symbolic data from the SymPy library (symbols, binomial, Sum, IndexedBase, Idx) and input variables like 'ndim', 'order', and the IndexedBase 'M'. It also reads the entire code for symbolic computation and string replacements.",
  "sinks": "Outputs generated Python code strings for central moments, via print statements and string replacements; no external data or untrusted input handling is evident. No sinks that execute or transmit data are present.",
  "flows": "The code flows from defining symbolic variables, looping over moment orders, constructing symbolic sums, substituting centroid expressions, and printing Python code snippets for each calculated moment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected. No obfuscated language features, unnecessary dynamic code execution, or misleading variable names are present. The code is straightforward symbolic computation and string formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code performs symbolic calculations for moments of images in 2D and 3D by generating expressions for central moments based on raw moments. It uses SymPy to create symbolic sums, binomial coefficients, and substitutions for centroid calculations. The output is Python code snippets that assign these expressions to a 'moments_central' array. There are no external data inputs, network operations, or system modifications. The only potential concern might be the print statements, but they serve for code generation purposes. Overall, the script appears to be a mathematical utility without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for generating symbolic expressions for image moment calculations. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident. It performs symbolic mathematics and outputs code snippets for further use. Its structure and content are consistent with mathematical code generation without malicious intent.",
