  "conclusion": "While no malware or obfuscation is present, the use of eval() on external data introduces a significant security vulnerability. The current scores underestimate this risk. The security risk score should be increased to approximately 0.7 to reflect the potential for arbitrary code execution if the header file is maliciously altered. Overall, the code is straightforward but insecure due to eval(), and should be refactored for safety."
