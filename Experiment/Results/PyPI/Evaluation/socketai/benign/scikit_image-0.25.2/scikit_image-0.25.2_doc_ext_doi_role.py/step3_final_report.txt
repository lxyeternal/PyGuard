  "purpose": "Provides Sphinx roles for linking to DOI and arXiv resources within documentation.",
  "sources": "Input text in role definitions, processed by utils.unescape and split_explicit_title.",
  "sinks": "Constructed URLs using user-provided DOI/arXiv identifiers; no external data or code execution.",
  "flows": "Input text -> unescape -> split_explicit_title -> URL concatenation -> reference node creation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines roles for DOI and arXiv links, processes input safely, and constructs URLs straightforwardly. No network activity, code execution, or obfuscation is present. Input handling is standard, and the functions only generate external links. No vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured Sphinx extension for adding external resource links. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores in the reports are justified and should remain as is.",
