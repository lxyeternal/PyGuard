  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate open-source data analysis script with bugs and outdated libraries but no malicious payloads or behaviors. The assigned scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2. No further action is necessary; fixing bugs would improve functionality but does not impact security posture."
