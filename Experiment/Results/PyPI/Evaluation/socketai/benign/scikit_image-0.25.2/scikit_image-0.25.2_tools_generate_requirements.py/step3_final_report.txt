  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward file I/O and dependency parsing with standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The script reads 'pyproject.toml' dependencies and optional dependencies, then writes them into text files with headers. It uses standard and fallback libraries for parsing, handles file paths securely, and performs simple read/write operations. No dynamic code execution, network activity, obfuscation, or malicious code is present. The code is clear, well-structured, and performs a benign utility function. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for dependency file generation with no security issues or malware. The reports accurately assess its safety, and the scoring is appropriate. No improvements or changes are necessary.",
