  "purpose": "The script generates requirements files from the dependencies listed in pyproject.toml for project setup and environment management.",
  "sources": "Reads the pyproject.toml file from the project root directory.",
  "sinks": "Writes dependency lists to text files in the requirements directory.",
  "flows": "Reads pyproject.toml -> processes dependencies -> writes dependency lists to files.",
  "anomalies": "Uses standard file read and write operations; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code. No dynamic execution or external network calls. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script loads dependencies from a pyproject.toml file using a conditional import for tomllib or tomli. It then generates text files with the dependencies listed, including optional dependencies. The file operations are straightforward, writing static content with dependency data. No external network activity, no malicious code patterns, and no suspicious behavior detected. The code functions solely to extract dependencies and write them to files, which is a common and benign activity in build or setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility script for dependency management, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It securely reads configuration data and outputs requirement files without any suspicious operations.",
