  "purpose": "This script generates requirement files from a pyproject.toml file, facilitating dependency management.",
  "sources": "Reads from the file system: the script's own file path, pyproject.toml, and writes to requirement files.",
  "sinks": "Writes dependency lists to files in the requirements directory; no untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Reads pyproject.toml -> processes dependency data -> writes dependency data to files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. Uses standard library for reading files and dependencies from a well-defined configuration file.",
  "analysis": "The code imports system and path modules, then attempts to import toml parsing libraries, handling different Python versions. It reads a pyproject.toml file, extracts dependencies, and writes formatted requirement files with headers. No dynamic code execution, external network calls, or data exfiltration is present. The logic is straightforward, focusing solely on file reading and writing operations, with no obfuscated code or suspicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs a benign function of generating dependency files from a project configuration. No malicious activity or security risks are apparent based on the provided code.",
