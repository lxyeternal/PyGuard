  "purpose": "The script generates requirement files from pyproject.toml dependencies for project setup or environment reproducibility.",
  "sources": "Reads the content of pyproject.toml file and the script's own file path.",
  "sinks": "Writes dependency lists into files within the requirements directory.",
  "flows": "Reads pyproject.toml -> processes dependencies -> writes to requirements/*.txt files",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code dynamically loads dependencies and writes files based on standard project files.",
  "analysis": "The script securely loads pyproject.toml using standard libraries with fallback options. It processes dependencies and optional dependencies to generate requirements files. File paths are constructed based on the script's location, and the data flow involves reading project configuration and writing output files. No obfuscated code, network activity, or malicious logic is present. The use of standard libraries and straightforward file operations suggests normal behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a legitimate task of generating requirements files from project configuration. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard utility script with no suspicious intent.",
