  "purpose": "Script to auto-generate API documentation for the skimage package.",
  "sources": "Reading the skimage version from the module, reading the __init__.py file to get source version, reading and opening files for documentation generation.",
  "sinks": "Writing API documentation files, printing warnings and errors.",
  "flows": "Source: import and version check; Source: reading __init__.py; Sink: writing documentation files; Sink: print and abort calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secret keys. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or unusual patterns. Use of open() without context manager is typical in scripts but not inherently suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and a local API doc writer. It verifies the presence of the 'skimage' package and checks version consistency between installed and source versions, aborting if mismatched. It then proceeds to generate API documentation, filtering certain patterns. The code only performs file operations, version checks, and documentation generation calls. No suspicious network activity, no backdoors, no malicious data handling, or obfuscated code present. The overall flow is straightforward and typical of documentation scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate script for generating API documentation with no malicious intent or suspicious behaviors detected. It uses standard Python practices for file and module handling without any obfuscation or malicious activity.",
