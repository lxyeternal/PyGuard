  "purpose": "The script automates the generation of API documentation for the 'skimage' package.",
  "sources": "Reads from sys.modules, open('../skimage/__init__.py'), and the input package's __version__ attribute.",
  "sinks": "Calls methods of ApiDocWriter that write files to 'source/api' directory.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from the module and source file, then generates documentation files via ApiDocWriter methods.",
  "anomalies": "Uses open() without context manager, which could lead to resource leaks; no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code detected; no external network activity or system modifications present.",
  "analysis": "The code verifies the presence and version consistency of the 'skimage' package before generating API documentation using ApiDocWriter. It reads the package's __version__ attribute and compares it with the version specified in the source file. If versions mismatch or import fails, it aborts. It then proceeds to generate documentation files into a specified directory, with some pattern exclusions. No malicious or suspicious behavior such as network activity, credential handling, or obfuscation is evident. Use of open() without context management is a minor code quality issue but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate utility for documentation generation with no signs of malicious intent or malware. No security risks are identified beyond minor resource handling concerns. Overall, it appears safe.",
