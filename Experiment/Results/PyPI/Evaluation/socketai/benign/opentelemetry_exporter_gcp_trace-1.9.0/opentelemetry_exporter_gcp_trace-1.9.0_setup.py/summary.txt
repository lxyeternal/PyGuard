  "conclusion": "The code pattern used poses a moderate security risk due to the use of exec() on a local file, which could be exploited if the file is tampered with. No evidence of malicious code exists, and the malware score remains 0. The risk score should be around 0.4, reflecting the potential vector but not active malicious intent. To improve security, replace exec() with safer methods of obtaining version information."
