  "analysis": "The code reads the version.py file located in a specific directory and executes its content via exec() to extract the __version__ variable. This pattern is common in setup scripts but introduces a security risk if the version.py file is malicious or tampered with. No malicious code is present in the provided snippet; the concern is about potential exploitation if the file's integrity is compromised. The malware score is appropriately 0, as no malicious activity is evident. The obfuscated score is 0, given the straightforward nature of the code. The security risk score is moderate (~0.4), reflecting the inherent risk of executing external code during setup, which could be exploited if the file is compromised. The overall assessment indicates that while the pattern is risky, it does not constitute active malicious behavior, but best practices suggest replacing exec() with safer alternatives, such as importing the version module directly or reading the version string without executing code.",
  "conclusion": "The code pattern used poses a moderate security risk due to the use of exec() on a local file, which could be exploited if the file is tampered with. No evidence of malicious code exists, and the malware score remains 0. The risk score should be around 0.4, reflecting the potential vector but not active malicious intent. To improve security, replace exec() with safer methods of obtaining version information.",
