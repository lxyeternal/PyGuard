  "purpose": "Load version information from a separate file and set up the package configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the version.py file to execute its contents.",
  "sinks": "exec(f.read(), PACKAGE_INFO) which executes code from version.py.",
  "flows": "Reading version.py content into memory and executing it to populate PACKAGE_INFO.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to execute code from an external file, which can be risky if the file contents are malicious or tampered with.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a version.py file and executes its contents to retrieve the version string, which is then used in setuptools.setup(). The use of exec() on an external file is generally discouraged because it can execute arbitrary code, posing a potential security risk if the file is compromised. The rest of the code is standard package setup code. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors are evident beyond the use of exec().",
  "conclusion": "The code performs typical setup operations but employs exec() to execute contents of a version file, which can be a security concern if the file is maliciously altered. Overall, the risk is low but the exec() usage is noteworthy.",
