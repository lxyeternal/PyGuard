  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe code that is purely licensing comments and a static version string.\n- No executable logic, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or anomalies are detected.\n- The source code snippets are standard boilerplate for open-source projects.\n\n**Specific review of each report:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Correctly identifies the code as license header and version info.\n- No issues with the reasoning.\n- Security risk score is appropriately 0.\n- Malware score is 0, as no malicious activity is indicated.\n- Confidence is high (1).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Also correctly describes the code as package metadata.\n- No errors or suspicious points.\n- Scores are appropriate.\n- Confidence is high.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Accurate assessment as license header and version declaration.\n- No anomalies or malicious activity.\n- Scores are appropriate.\n- Confidence is high.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Correctly notes that it's a licensing header with version info.\n- No issues detected.\n- Scores are appropriate.\n- Confidence is high.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Consistent with previous assessments.\n- No executable code or suspicious activity.\n- Scores are appropriate.\n- Confidence is high.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Analysis and Final Judgment:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is only licensing comments and a version string.\n- **Malware potential:** None of the snippets contain any malicious code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Obfuscation:** Not present.\n- **Security risk:** None, as the code is purely declarative and boilerplate.\n\n### Final Scores and Justification:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is straightforward and standard.\n- **Risk score:** 0, because the code is non-executable, standard boilerplate, and contains no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Summary:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No changes needed; all assessments are appropriate.\n- The code is benign, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the code snippet's nature.",
