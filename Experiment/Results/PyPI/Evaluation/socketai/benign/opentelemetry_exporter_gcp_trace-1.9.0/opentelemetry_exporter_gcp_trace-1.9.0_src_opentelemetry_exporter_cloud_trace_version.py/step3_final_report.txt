  "sources": "The static comments and the assignment '__version__ = \"1.9.0\"'.",
  "sinks": "No data input/output or external interactions; no untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "None, as the code contains only static declarations without data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments and a version string assignment, with no executable logic, data processing, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify the code as benign boilerplate. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard license header and version declaration with no malicious or security concerns. All assessments are accurate, and no modifications are necessary.",
