  "purpose": "This code appears to define package metadata, specifically the version number, for a Python project or module.",
  "sources": "The source of data is the hardcoded string __version__ = \"1.9.0\".",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data flows into sensitive operations or data leaks.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from any source to a sink, as the code only sets a version string.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for Python package metadata. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely declarative, setting a version variable with a static string. It includes licensing comments, which are standard. No functions, input/output, or dynamic code are present. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward version declaration with licensing comments, presenting no malicious intent or security risks.",
