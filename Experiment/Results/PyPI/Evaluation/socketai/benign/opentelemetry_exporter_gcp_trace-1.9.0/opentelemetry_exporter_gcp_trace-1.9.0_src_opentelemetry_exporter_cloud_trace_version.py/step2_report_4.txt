  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: License header and version info.\n- Findings: No code execution, data flow, or suspicious activity.\n- Conclusion: Benign, standard licensing boilerplate.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Package metadata (version string).\n- Findings: Static assignment, no data flow or malicious activity.\n- Conclusion: Safe, straightforward version declaration.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: License header and version info.\n- Findings: No executable code, data flow, or anomalies.\n- Conclusion: Benign license header.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Licensing and version declaration.\n- Findings: No suspicious activity, static data.\n- Conclusion: Standard boilerplate.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Licensing info and version string.\n- Findings: No executable logic or data flow.\n- Conclusion: Benign.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports describe snippets that are purely licensing comments and a version string, with no executable code, data flow, or suspicious patterns. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the content.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports — correct, no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk present.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The reports are thorough and consistent.\n- The code snippets are standard boilerplate/license headers, common in open-source projects.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are justified here.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the current scores and conclusions.** No changes are necessary.",
