  "purpose": "Test implementation for exporting trace spans to Google Cloud Trace using OpenTelemetry SDK.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded trace ID, span ID, resource info, and project ID; creation of span and resource data.",
  "sinks": "Export function sends data via insecure gRPC channel; no untrusted input handling.",
  "flows": "Span creation with static IDs and resource info -> export via insecure gRPC channel to Google Cloud Trace.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded IDs, insecure gRPC channel, and static resource data typical for testing; no malicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test case for exporting spans, with no malicious payloads, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity. The hardcoded IDs and insecure channel are standard in testing environments. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score (~0.1-0.2) reflects typical test setup considerations. The scores are consistent with the benign, test-focused nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely for testing, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
