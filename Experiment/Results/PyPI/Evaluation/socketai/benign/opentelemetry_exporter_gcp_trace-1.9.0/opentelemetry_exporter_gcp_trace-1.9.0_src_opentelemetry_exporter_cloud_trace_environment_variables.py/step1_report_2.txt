  "purpose": "Define environment variable names and constants for configuring Google Cloud Trace exporter in OpenTelemetry.",
  "sources": "Environment variables: OTEL_EXPORTER_GCP_TRACE_PROJECT_ID, OTEL_EXPORTER_GCP_TRACE_RESOURCE_REGEX",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data leaks or untrusted data handling; code only defines constants and docstrings",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code is static configuration with no dynamic or untrusted data processing",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward constant definitions and descriptive docstrings",
  "analysis": "The code contains environment variable names and regex configuration constants for an OpenTelemetry exporter. No input reading, data processing, or untrusted data handling observed. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs. The code appears to be purely for configuration purposes with clear licensing and documentation. No evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration snippet for environment variable references and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It simply sets constants and provides documentation for an OpenTelemetry GCP tracing setup.",
