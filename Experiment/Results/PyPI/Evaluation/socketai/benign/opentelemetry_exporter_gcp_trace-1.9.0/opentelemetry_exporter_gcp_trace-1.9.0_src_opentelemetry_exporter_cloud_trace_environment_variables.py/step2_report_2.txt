  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   The code only defines string constants for environment variable names and provides descriptive docstrings. There are no dynamic operations, input handling, network calls, or data processing. The constants are used for configuration purposes, and no secrets or credentials are embedded.  \n   **Conclusion**: No issues or malicious behavior are present in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is purely declarative and configuration-oriented. They uniformly state that no malicious activity, data leaks, or suspicious behavior is detected. There are no logical errors or flawed reasoning in these assessments.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0, security risk of 0, and obfuscated score of 0, which is consistent with the code's nature. Given the code's benign nature, these scores are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since the code is purely static configuration with no handling of untrusted input, no network operations, and no secrets, the risk scores are correctly low. Higher scores would be unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score of 0 across all reports is accurate. There is no indication of malicious intent or behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports avoid assumptions about malicious intent; they correctly interpret the code as configuration setup. No unwarranted assumptions are present.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Security Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Overall, the code is a straightforward configuration snippet with no security issues, malicious intent, or obfuscation.**\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe code is benign, serves as configuration for environment variable names, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
