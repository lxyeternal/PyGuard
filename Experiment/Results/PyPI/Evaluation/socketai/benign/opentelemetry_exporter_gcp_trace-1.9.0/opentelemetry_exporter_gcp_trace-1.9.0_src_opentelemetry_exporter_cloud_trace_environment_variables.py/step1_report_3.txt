  "purpose": "Define environment variable names and related documentation for configuring Google Cloud Trace exporter in OpenTelemetry.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded environment variable names: 'OTEL_EXPORTER_GCP_TRACE_PROJECT_ID' and 'OTEL_EXPORTER_GCP_TRACE_RESOURCE_REGEX'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flows to external systems or sensitive locations.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no dynamic data flows, input handling, or external calls.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only static variable definitions and docstrings; no unusual or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of constant variable definitions for environment variable names used in configuration, accompanied by detailed docstrings. No input processing, external calls, or data manipulation occurs. The variables are used for configuration purposes and do not contain or reference any secrets, credentials, or executable code. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard documentation practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration snippet with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply defines environment variable names and provides documentation. No suspicious or malicious activity is detected.",
