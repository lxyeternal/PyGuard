  "purpose": "Define environment variables and constants for configuring Google Cloud Trace exporter in OpenTelemetry.",
  "sources": "Environment variable names and constant assignments",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows involving untrusted input leading to data leaks or malicious actions",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; primarily constant definitions",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variable names as string constants; no evidence of dynamic code execution or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code defines string constants for environment variable names used for configuring Google Cloud Trace exporter. It does not read or process environment variables dynamically; it only declares constants. There are no user inputs, data flows, or functions that handle untrusted data. The comments explain their intended use but do not perform any operations. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code structures are present. Overall, this is standard configuration code without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration snippet with no malicious behavior or security risks. It merely declares constants and documentation for environment variables related to OpenTelemetry Google Cloud Trace exporter setup.",
