  "purpose": "Define environment variable names and related constants for configuring Google Cloud Trace exporter in OpenTelemetry.",
  "sources": "Environment variables: OTEL_EXPORTER_GCP_TRACE_PROJECT_ID and OTEL_EXPORTER_GCP_TRACE_RESOURCE_REGEX.",
  "kills": "No untrusted input handling or network operations observed; no data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Environment variable names are defined as string constants; no dynamic data flow from external input to critical operations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variable keys as string constants is typical; no hardcoded credentials, secrets, or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily declares string constants representing environment variable names used for configuration. It contains descriptive docstrings explaining their purpose. There are no inputs, no network calls, no data processing, or dynamic code execution. The constants serve as configuration keys for a monitoring/exporter setup. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected. The code appears to be part of a configuration module, not performing any operations or handling sensitive data.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward configuration snippet defining environment variable keys, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It poses no security risks.",
