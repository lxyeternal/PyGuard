  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code only assigns static string values to variables with descriptive comments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of variable assignments with static strings and descriptive docstrings. It does not process any untrusted input, perform network operations, or include executable code. No suspicious or malicious behaviors such as data leakage, backdoors, or code injection are present. It appears to be a configuration setup for environment variables related to OpenTelemetry exporter settings.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as configuration documentation and variable initialization for environment variables. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be safe and benign.",
