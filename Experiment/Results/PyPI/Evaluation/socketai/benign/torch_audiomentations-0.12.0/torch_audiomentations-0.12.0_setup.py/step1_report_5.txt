{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for packaging a Python project named 'torch-audiomentations'. It handles reading package metadata, dependencies, and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description, reads the __version__ string from a source file, and gathers package dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or code execution are present; all data reads are from static files or predefined strings.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from a source file, uses this info in package setup; no untrusted data flows to critical points.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements are present. The version extraction pattern is straightforward and safe.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup procedures for a Python package, including reading static files and setting configuration parameters. The version is extracted via regex from a source file, which is typical and safe. No user input, network data, or untrusted sources are processed. The dependencies are explicitly listed, with no dynamic or insecure handling observed. Overall, the code appears to be a typical, safe setup script without malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security vulnerabilities. It safely reads static files and sets up the package metadata and dependencies.",
