{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'torch-audiomentations' Python package, used for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, reading '__version__' from package's '__init__.py' file.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data outputs or system calls with untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Read long description -> read version string from source file -> package setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious code behavior. Use of regex to parse version is standard; no hardcoded secrets or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a README file and extracts a version string using regex from the package's '__init__.py'. The setup() function uses these inputs to configure the package. All operations are standard for Python package setup scripts. No malicious behavior, suspicious data handling, or malicious code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It reads files and configures package metadata securely. No suspicious activity detected.",
