  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'torch-audiomentations' Python library.",
  "sources": "File reads for README.md and version extraction from '__init__.py'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; mainly reads static files and defines package configuration.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md -> Stores in variable; reads version info from '__init__.py' -> extracts version string.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup procedures: reading a README file, extracting version info via regex, and calling setup() with package details. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data leaks are present. The use of regular expressions and file I/O appears safe and standard. The package dependencies are specified explicitly. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical package setup configuration with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It appears safe and aligned with common practices for Python package distribution.",
