  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package, performing standard operations such as reading files, extracting version info, and configuring package metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, reading '__init__.py' to extract version info via regex.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external network calls or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "Reading files (README.md, __init__.py) -> regex extraction of version -> setup() call with metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward file reads and regex usage; no obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical setup tasks: reading static files, extracting version info with regex, and calling setuptools.setup() with package details. No external data flows, dynamic code execution, or malicious patterns are present. The regex for version extraction is standard and safe. Dependencies are explicitly listed and static. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are detected. The code is consistent with common, benign setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign setup configuration with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, and risk: 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code analysis.",
