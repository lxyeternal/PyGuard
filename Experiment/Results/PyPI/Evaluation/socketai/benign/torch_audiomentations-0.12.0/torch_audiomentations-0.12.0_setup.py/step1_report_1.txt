  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package 'torch-audiomentations' including reading version info and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file, reading package version from __init__.py, extracting version string via regex.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data outputs or external calls based on this code.",
  "flows": "Readme content and version info are read and processed locally; no external data flow or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code. The code performs standard setup procedures. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a Markdown README file and retrieves the package version from __init__.py using a regex. The setup() function configures package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. All operations are typical for Python package setup scripts. There are no external data transmissions, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behaviors. The code does not include any features that could be exploited for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign setup script for a Python package. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected. It follows common practices for package configuration without any anomalies or suspicious elements.",
