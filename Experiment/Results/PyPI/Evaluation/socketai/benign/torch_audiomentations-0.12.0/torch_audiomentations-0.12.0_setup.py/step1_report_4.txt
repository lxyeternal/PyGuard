{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'torch-audiomentations' Python package, including reading metadata and defining dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file, reading the version string from the package's __init__.py, and extracting package dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None identified that process untrusted data directly; the code primarily handles package metadata and setup parameters.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no untrusted data flows from input sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code present. The code uses standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script reads static files (README.md, __init__.py) to gather package metadata and version information. It then uses setuptools to configure package installation parameters. All file reads are from local, predefined paths, and dependencies are hardcoded as static strings. No dynamic code execution, network connections, or handling of untrusted input is observed. The code follows typical Python packaging conventions without suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It solely handles package metadata and dependencies, with no suspicious or malicious logic detected.",
