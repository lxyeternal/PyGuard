{
  "purpose": "Unit testing the RMS normalization function of the Audio utility class in the torch_audiomentations package.",
  "sources": "Imports from numpy, pytest, torch, and a local module torch_audiomentations.utils.io.Audio; creation of torch.rand samples.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include any data sinks, network connections, file I/O, or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Samples are generated using torch.rand, processed through Audio.rms_normalize, then converted to numpy for verification.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs straightforward unit testing with standard library usage. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports common scientific and testing libraries, then defines a test class with parameterized test cases for different tensor shapes. It generates random float tensors, normalizes their RMS using a method from the Audio class, and verifies that the shape remains consistent and the RMS is normalized to approximately 1. The code's structure and operations are typical for testing scientific functions; there are no indications of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard unit test for a normalization function without any malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and does not contain malware or suspicious behaviors.",
