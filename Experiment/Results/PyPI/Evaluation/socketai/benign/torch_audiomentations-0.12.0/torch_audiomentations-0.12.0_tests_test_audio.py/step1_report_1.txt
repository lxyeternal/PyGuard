  "purpose": "Unit test for the rms_normalize function in the Audio utility class of torch_audiomentations.",
  "sources": "Import statements for numpy, pytest, torch, and the Audio class from torch_audiomentations.utils.io.",
  "sinks": "The test invokes rms_normalize, which processes tensor data; no untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the creation of random tensor samples through rms_normalize, then back into assertions on the tensor data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code is standard testing code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports common libraries, defines a test class with a parameterized test method, creates random tensor samples, normalizes them using rms_normalize, and checks that the normalized RMS is approximately 1.0. All operations are typical for unit testing. There are no signs of malicious activity, data leakage, or suspicious data flows.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward unit test for a normalization function with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is standard testing code with no indications of malware or malicious behavior.",
