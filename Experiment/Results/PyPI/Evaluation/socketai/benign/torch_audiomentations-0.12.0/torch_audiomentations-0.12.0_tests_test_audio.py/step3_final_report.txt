  "purpose": "Unit test for the rms_normalize function in the Audio class, verifying shape preservation and RMS normalization.",
  "sources": "Random tensor samples generated within the test function.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network calls, or data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "Input tensors are created, passed to rms_normalize, and results are checked for shape and RMS value.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unit test that creates random tensors, applies rms_normalize, and asserts the output shape and RMS value. It uses standard libraries and practices, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The logic is correct, and the test is typical for such functionality. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard testing code with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
