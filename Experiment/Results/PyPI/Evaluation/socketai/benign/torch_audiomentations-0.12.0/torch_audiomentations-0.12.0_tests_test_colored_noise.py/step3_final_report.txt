  "purpose": "Unit tests for torch_audiomentations' AddColoredNoise transform, verifying behavior with various inputs and parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads audio files from TEST_FIXTURES_DIR and generates synthetic tensors for testing.",
  "sinks": "In-memory tensor processing; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input audio data flows through transformations and assertions within the test functions; no external sinks involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard set of unit tests for an audio augmentation library, utilizing real audio files and synthetic data. It performs parameter validation, output shape checks, and warning handling, all within a controlled testing environment. No external communication, malicious code, or obfuscation is present. Use of random seeds and warnings aligns with best practices. The code's purpose is solely to verify functionality, with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured test code for an audio processing library. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is minimal, around 0.0 to 0.1, reflecting the safe, testing nature of the code.",
