{
  "purpose": "Unit testing for the TimeInversion audio augmentation class from torch_audiomentations.",
  "sources": "The code reads sample tensors (self.samples) and input parameters for the augment method (samples, sample_rate).",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data affects system security or leaks are present; the code primarily performs data manipulation and assertions.",
  "flows": "Samples are created as tensors, passed through augmentation, and compared to expected outputs, with no external data flows or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs are detected. The code follows standard testing patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unit test suite for a specific audio augmentation method. It initializes sample data, applies transformations, and asserts correctness. No obfuscated or malicious code, no external data sources or sinks, and no suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit test for audio augmentation functionality. It does not contain malware or security risks.",
