  "purpose": "Unit testing for the TimeInversion audio augmentation class in torch_audiomentations.",
  "sources": "Input data is generated within the test using torch.arange and torch.stack.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data or network communication is present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from generated tensors into the augmentation function, then is checked for correctness.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears to perform standard unit tests without obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines unit tests for a data augmentation method, creating sample tensors and verifying reversed audio output. It uses standard libraries and methods, with no signs of malicious code, suspicious data handling, or external dependencies beyond normal testing. There are no hardcoded secrets, external network calls, or unusual code constructs. The logic strictly pertains to testing tensor operations and shape validations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward unit test for an audio processing augmentation with no malicious intent or security risks. It functions as expected for standard testing purposes.",
