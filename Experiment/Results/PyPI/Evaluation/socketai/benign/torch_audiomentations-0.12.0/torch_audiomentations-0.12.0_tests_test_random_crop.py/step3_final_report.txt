  "purpose": "Unit tests for the RandomCrop class in torch_audiomentations, verifying cropping behavior with synthetic data.",
  "sources": "torch.rand() generating random tensors as input samples.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network calls, or data leaks; all operations are in-memory.",
  "flows": "Input tensors are processed by RandomCrop, with assertions on output shape and equality; no external data flows or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test suite for a data augmentation class, using synthetic random data, performing shape and equality assertions, and including a skipped CUDA test. No external dependencies or malicious behaviors are present. The code structure and content are standard for testing frameworks, with no signs of obfuscation or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and free of malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
