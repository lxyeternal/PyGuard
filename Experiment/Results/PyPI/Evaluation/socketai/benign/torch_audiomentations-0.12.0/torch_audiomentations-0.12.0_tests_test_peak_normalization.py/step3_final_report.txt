{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for the PeakNormalization class, verifying normalization behavior, handling of silence, stereo audio, parameter freezing, and application probability.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from numpy arrays and torch tensors, particularly during test setup and augmentation calls.",
  "sinks": "There are no external sinks; the code does not perform network communication, file I/O beyond test data, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from numpy arrays into torch tensors, through the PeakNormalization augmentation, and back into numpy arrays for verification.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code performs straightforward normalization tests with proper handling of edge cases like silence to prevent division by zero.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured test suite for audio normalization, involving no suspicious or malicious operations. It tests various scenarios, including digital silence, stereo sound, and parameter freezing, all with safe and clear logic. No external communication, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code's behavior is purely computational and intended for validation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0, all consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
  "model": "gpt-4.1-nano"
