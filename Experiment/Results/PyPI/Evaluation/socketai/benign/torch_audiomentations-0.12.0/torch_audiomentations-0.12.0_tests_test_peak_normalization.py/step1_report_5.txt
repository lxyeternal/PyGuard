{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for the PeakNormalization class, designed to validate its functionality and edge cases.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from numpy arrays and torch tensors, primarily from the test cases.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output beyond standard assertions; no untrusted data is written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Data flows from numpy arrays into torch tensors, through the PeakNormalization augmentation, and back to numpy for validation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious code constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, consisting of unit tests for a normalization class. It uses standard libraries like numpy, torch, pytest, and unittest. There are no signs of malicious activity such as network connections, system modifications, or data exfiltration. The only notable aspect is that it performs data normalization in test cases, which is standard practice. No suspicious or hidden code segments are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate test code with no malicious intent or security risks. It solely verifies the behavior of the PeakNormalization class under various conditions. No signs of malware or malicious modifications are observed.",
