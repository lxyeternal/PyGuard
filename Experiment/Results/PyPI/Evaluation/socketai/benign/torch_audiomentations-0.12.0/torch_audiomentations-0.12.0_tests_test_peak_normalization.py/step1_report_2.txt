{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for the PeakNormalization class in the torch_audiomentations library, verifying its functionality across various scenarios.",
  "sources": "The code reads sample audio data from numpy arrays, including static test inputs and random batch data, and also reads device state (CUDA availability).",
  "sinks": "The code does not write to files, send data over network, or execute external commands. No sinks for untrusted data or external effects are present.",
  "flows": "Samples are loaded into numpy arrays, converted to torch tensors, possibly moved to GPU, processed through PeakNormalization, and results are converted back to numpy for assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures are present. The code focuses solely on testing the PeakNormalization functionality. No obfuscation, code injection, or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a test class with multiple test methods that create numpy arrays as audio samples, convert them to torch tensors, and process them via PeakNormalization. It verifies correctness of normalization, handling of silence, no-apply cases, CUDA support, and parameter freezing. No external data sources, network communication, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code appears straightforward, purpose-driven, and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test suite for an audio normalization class, with no indications of malicious intent, data leakage, or security risks. It is focused on correctness and robustness of the library functions.",
