{
  "purpose": "The code defines unit tests for the PeakNormalization class, verifying its functionality on various inputs and configurations.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from numpy arrays defined within each test case; the augment object reads data via torch tensors passed to its call method.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not perform any data output, network communication, or data storage operations.",
  "flows": "Input numpy arrays are converted to torch tensors, passed to the PeakNormalization object, which processes them, then results are converted back to numpy arrays for assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns detected; all code appears standard for unit testing purposes. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious operations are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical unit testing for a normalization function, including edge cases like digital silence and stereo sound. It uses common testing libraries and standard practices. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code behavior. No external or network communications are involved, and no sensitive data handling or injection points are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward unit test suite for a signal normalization class, with no malicious or security-threatening behavior detected. It appears safe and legitimate.",
