  "purpose": "Unit tests for the torch_audiomentations library, specifically testing the OneOf augmentation class with different output types.",
  "sources": "Random audio tensor generated by torch.randn, input parameters for augmentation classes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data or network calls involved.",
  "flows": "Input data (audio tensor) flows through augmentation transforms, with output type verification; no external data flow or malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward test code with standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign unit test suite for audio augmentation, applying random data and verifying output types. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The code does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with this benign analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, non-obfuscated, and free of malware. The current scores are appropriate and should remain at zero across all categories.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
