{
  "purpose": "Defines various data types, type aliases, and structured data representations for power grid modeling, mainly for type hinting and data organization.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard typing and numpy modules, and from power_grid_model._core.dataset_definitions; defines type aliases and data structures.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks, no untrusted data handling or network operations present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink flows; the code primarily declares types and data structures without runtime logic or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. The code is straightforward type definitions and data schemas.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type aliases, class definitions, and data structure descriptions for a power grid model project. It imports necessary modules, defines numerous type aliases for numpy arrays and dictionaries, and documents example usage for clarity. There are no runtime functions, data processing, or security-sensitive operations. All code appears to be standard, well-documented, and intended for static type hinting and data structure clarity. No suspicious or malicious code, no external data handling, or network activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of data type definitions and documentation for a power grid modeling project. It contains no malicious behavior, no obfuscated code, and no security risks. It serves purely as schema and type hinting support, with no evidence of sabotage or malware.",
