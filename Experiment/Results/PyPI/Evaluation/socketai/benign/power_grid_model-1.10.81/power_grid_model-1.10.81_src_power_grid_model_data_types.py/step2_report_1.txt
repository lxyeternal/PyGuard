  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports conclude that the code is purely a set of type definitions, data schemas, and documentation.\n- No runtime logic, data processing, external input/output, or network operations are present.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code features are identified.\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Logical Checks:\n\n- **Code Content:** The code is entirely composed of type aliases, class definitions, and docstrings. It does not execute any logic, handle data input/output, or perform operations that could be exploited.\n- **Imports:** Standard modules (`typing`, `numpy`) and internal project modules are used solely for type hinting.\n- **Purpose:** To define data structures and aliases for datasets in a power grid modeling context.\n- **Malware or Obfuscation:** None detected; no code obfuscation, hidden logic, or suspicious constructs.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No vulnerabilities or attack vectors are apparent in static type definitions.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score (0):** Correct. No malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score (0):** Correct. The code is straightforward, well-documented, and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score (0):** Correct. No security risk or attack surface is evident.\n\n---\n\n### Any Potential Discrepancies?\n\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable in their assessment.\n- No reason to adjust scores; all align with the code's static, non-executable nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- The code is purely declarative, with no runtime or executable components.  \n- It serves as a schema and type hinting module, which is standard and safe.  \n- No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is benign, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No changes needed.",
