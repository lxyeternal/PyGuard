{
  "purpose": "Definition of data types and structures for handling power grid model datasets, both in numpy and native Python formats.",
  "sources": "Imports (typing, numpy, power_grid_model._core.dataset_definitions), type alias definitions, class and variable declarations.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no untrusted data outputs, external network operations, or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code is purely type and data structure definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. No code execution, network activity, or system modification present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type alias definitions, data class/type descriptions, and documentation strings. It imports standard and project-specific modules but does not include any runtime logic, input handling, or system interaction. No signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or malicious behavior are present. The structure indicates a focus on data schema clarity for power grid datasets, with no evidence of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a straightforward, well-documented set of data type definitions for power grid datasets. There are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code's purpose is to improve clarity and consistency of dataset handling within the project, with no suspicious or harmful content.",
