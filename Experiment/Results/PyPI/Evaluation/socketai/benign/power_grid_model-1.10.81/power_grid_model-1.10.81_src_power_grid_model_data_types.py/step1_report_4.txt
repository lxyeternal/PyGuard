{
  "purpose": "Defines data types and structures used in the Power Grid Model project for handling datasets, attributes, and batch processing of power grid components.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (typing, numpy, project-specific dataset_definitions), type alias definitions, class definitions, and data structure declarations.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; the code mainly defines data types and structures without performing runtime operations or data handling.",
  "flows": "The code provides type hints and data structure templates; it does not implement runtime data flows or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behavior detected. The code appears to be purely structural/type definitions with no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of type aliases, data class definitions, and example annotations for power grid data structures. It imports standard libraries and project modules, defines various numpy array-based types for different dataset representations, and structures for batch processing. There are no functions executing logic, no data processing, network operations, or runtime code. The code is purely declarative and intended for data modeling, with no signs of malicious intent or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a non-malicious, purely structural module for data type definitions within a power grid modeling project. It contains no runtime, dynamic, or data handling operations that could be exploited maliciously.",
