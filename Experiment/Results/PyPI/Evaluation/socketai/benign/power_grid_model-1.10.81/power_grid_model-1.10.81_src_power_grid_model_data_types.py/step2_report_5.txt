  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the details of the code and the provided evaluations.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n\n- The code consists solely of type aliases, class definitions, and documentation strings.\n- No executable logic, data processing, or system interactions are present.\n- Imports are standard or project-specific modules, with no signs of malicious code.\n- No data input/output, network operations, or dynamic code execution.\n- The purpose appears to be to define data schemas and improve code clarity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues or vulnerabilities are present in the code.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code features are present.\n- **Malware risk:** Zero, as the code is purely structural.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- The reports do not identify any logical or security flaws; they correctly note the code's benign nature.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward nature.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0 or very low, which aligns with the absence of vulnerabilities.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The reports correctly interpret the code as purely structural, with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is consistent.\n- The scores are reasonable and justified given the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation features)  \n**Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe code is a well-documented, standard set of type definitions and data schemas used for dataset handling in a power grid modeling project. It does not contain any runtime logic, external data handling, or system interactions that could pose security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, benign, and serves purely as a schema definition module.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nI agree with the existing scores: **malware = 0**, **obfuscated = 0**, **risk = 0**. No further action needed.",
