{
  "purpose": "Defines various data types, aliases, and structures used throughout the Power Grid Model project for handling datasets, components, and batch data representations.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'typing', 'numpy', and internal module 'power_grid_model._core.dataset_definitions'. No external input or data reading present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data, execute system commands, or perform network operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is detected; the code primarily consists of type definitions and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "The code solely contains type aliases, class definitions, and docstrings. No code executes logic, no credentials, no backdoors, or suspicious constructs. No obfuscated code features are present.",
  "analysis": "The script exclusively defines type aliases, structured data types, and documentation for data structures used in the project. No data input, processing, or output functions are included. The use of numpy and internal module imports are standard. No code injection, malicious logic, or suspicious behavior is detectable. The code appears to be a well-documented type hinting and data structure definition module without executable or malicious content.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign type definition module for dataset structures in a power grid modeling project. It contains no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The apparent purpose is to standardize data representations, with no suspicious or malicious elements.",
