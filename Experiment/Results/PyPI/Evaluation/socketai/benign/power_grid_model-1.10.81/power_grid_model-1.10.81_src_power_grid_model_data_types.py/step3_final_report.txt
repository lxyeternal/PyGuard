{
  "purpose": "The code defines data types, type aliases, and data schemas for datasets used in a power grid modeling project, serving as static type hints and documentation.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports standard modules ('typing', 'numpy') and internal dataset definitions solely for type annotations.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leakage or system effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows or runtime logic are present; the code only establishes type aliases and data structure definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, well-documented, and contains no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely declarative, consisting of type aliases, class definitions, and documentation strings. It does not include executable logic, data processing, or external interactions. Imports are standard and used solely for type hinting. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of data schemas for dataset handling in a power grid modeling context. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The existing scores are appropriate and require no adjustment.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
