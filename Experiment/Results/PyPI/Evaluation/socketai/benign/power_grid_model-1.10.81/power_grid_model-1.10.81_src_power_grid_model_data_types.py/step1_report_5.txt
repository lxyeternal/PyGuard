{
  "purpose": "Defines various data types, aliases, and data structures used for power grid modeling and datasets, including numpy arrays, dictionaries, and native Python formats.",
  "sources": "Import statements, type alias definitions, class definitions, and variable initializations.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "N/A - No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; mostly type definitions and data structure specifications.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or behavior; the code is solely for defining types and data structures without any input/output handling, network operations, or file access. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of type aliases, structured data definitions, and documentation comments. It imports standard and external libraries (numpy) for data structures but does not include any functions, I/O, or executable logic. The defined data structures are typical for dataset representations in scientific or modeling applications. No code appears to be executing or processing data, and there are no indications of malicious intent or obfuscation. All constructs are straightforward, well-documented, and appropriate for their purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely structural, serving as type definitions and data format specifications for a power grid modeling project. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious operations. It is safe and appears to be standard in nature.",
