  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured utility module for dataset management with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the low risk score (~0.1) is justified given the handling of untrusted data files. Overall, it poses negligible supply chain security threat."
