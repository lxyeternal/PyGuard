  "purpose": "Utility functions for dataset serialization/deserialization, file I/O, dataset extraction, and self-testing within the power-grid-model library.",
  "sources": "File reading operations, dataset input data, deprecated functions warnings, internal dataset structures.",
  "sinks": "Reading untrusted JSON/msgpack files, writing output files, deprecated functions emitting warnings.",
  "flows": "File open/read -> json_deserialize/json_serialize/msgpack_deserialize/msgpack_serialize -> dataset processing -> file write.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated functions with warnings, no obfuscation, no network activity, no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard utility functions for handling datasets and serialization formats, with safe file operations and controlled self-test routines. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Deprecated functions are used with warnings but do not introduce vulnerabilities. The data flows are straightforward, with no external system interactions or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured utility module for dataset management with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the low risk score (~0.1) is justified given the handling of untrusted data files. Overall, it poses negligible supply chain security threat.",
