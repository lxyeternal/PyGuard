  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured internal utility module for dataset validation and transformation. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements. The low malware score (0) and obfuscation score (0) are appropriate, and the minimal security risk score (~0.1) reflects its focus on data integrity. Overall, the code is safe for supply chain use, with no signs of malicious activity or security issues."
