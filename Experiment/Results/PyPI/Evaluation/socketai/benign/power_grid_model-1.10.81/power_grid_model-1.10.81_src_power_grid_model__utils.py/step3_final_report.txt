{
  "purpose": "Internal helper functions for dataset validation, conversion, splitting, and integrity checks within power grid modeling. They handle numpy arrays, sparse structures, and data format transformations, ensuring data consistency and correctness.",
  "sources": "Reads from numpy arrays, dictionaries, sparse data structures, and metadata; performs validation and conversion on these data sources.",
  "sinks": "Outputs transformed datasets, converted data structures, and validation results; no external system calls or network activity.",
  "flows": "Source data (numpy arrays, dicts) undergo validation and format checks, then are split or converted into different representations, with errors raised on invalid formats.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; extensive use of validation functions and deepcopy, but these are standard for data integrity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs comprehensive data validation, format conversion, and splitting routines for datasets used in power grid modeling. It checks data types, dimensions, sparse/dense formats, and consistency of batch sizes. No external calls, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The functions are well-structured, with clear purpose, and include appropriate error handling. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage are detected. The code's design aligns with safe internal utility functions, and the malware and obfuscation scores are consistent with its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured internal utility module for dataset validation and transformation. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements. The low malware score (0) and obfuscation score (0) are appropriate, and the minimal security risk score (~0.1) reflects its focus on data integrity. Overall, the code is safe for supply chain use, with no signs of malicious activity or security issues.",
