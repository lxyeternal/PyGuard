  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a set of class definitions for custom exceptions in a power grid modeling library.\n- The code only contains class declarations, inheritance, type annotations, and docstrings.\n- No input/output, data processing, network activity, or executable logic is present.\n- The numpy import is used solely for type annotations; no operations or data handling involving numpy are performed.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n\n**Issue presence confirmation:**\n- The reported issues are not actual issues; the code is straightforward class definitions.\n- No malicious behavior, data leakage, or supply chain attack vectors are detected.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in reasoning:**\n- The reports correctly identify that the class attributes are only type hints and are not initialized or used.\n- They correctly note the absence of executable code or data handling.\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the reasoning.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- Malware score: all reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- Obfuscated score: all assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- Risk score: all assign 0 or very low, which is reasonable. Since no actual data handling or vulnerabilities are present, a score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n- Not applicable here; the code is purely class definitions with no malicious or risky behavior.\n\n**Malware considerations:**\n- No malicious intent or behavior is present; the code does not perform any harmful actions.\n\n**Claims based on assumptions:**\n- All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n**Score consistency:**\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores based on the entire review:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, benign set of custom exception class definitions for error handling within a library. It contains no malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis supply chain security incident report indicates no security concern. The code is safe, straightforward, and appropriate for its purpose.",
