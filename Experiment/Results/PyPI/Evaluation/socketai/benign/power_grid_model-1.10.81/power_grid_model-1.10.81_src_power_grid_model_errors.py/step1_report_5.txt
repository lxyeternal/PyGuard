{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling within the power-grid-model library.",
  "sources": "Import of numpy as np, class attribute definitions, class inheritance, and class docstrings.",
  "sinks": "None of the code appears to process untrusted data or include functions that handle external input/output directly.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input leading to security-sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only class definitions and no executable logic, data handling, or network operations. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to the power-grid-model. It imports numpy but does not utilize it for any operations; it only declares class attributes in one class without any logic or data handling. No external input, network activity, or file operations are present. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward, benign set of custom exception classes used for error handling in a larger power grid modeling library. It does not contain any malicious code, security risks, or suspicious patterns.",
