  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is solely a set of class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from built-in exceptions and each other.\n   - There are no executable functions, data processing, input/output operations, or dynamic code.\n   - The class attributes (like `failed_scenarios`, `error_messages`) are only annotated with types but not initialized or used; this is typical for type hints and documentation purposes.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or data leaks are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is purely defining error classes with no malicious behavior.\n   - They note the presence of class attributes with type annotations but no implementation or logic, which is accurate.\n   - No logical flaws or misconceptions are evident in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - malware: 0\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The high confidence (1.0 or 1) is justified.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The risk scores are all zero, which is appropriate.\n   - If any score were above 0.5, I would require justification based on malicious intent or vulnerability, which is absent here.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - All reports correctly assign malware = 0.\n   - No malicious behavior is present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the code's purpose as error class definitions.\n   - No overinterpretation of the numpy import or class attributes.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent and justified across all reports.\n\n**My Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risk or vulnerabilities identified.\n\n**Final Justification:**\n\nThis code is a standard, well-structured set of custom exception classes for error handling in a power grid modeling library. It contains no executable logic, data flow, or external interactions that could pose security concerns. The class attributes are only annotated and not used in a way that could introduce risks. The import of numpy is only for type annotations and does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The reports are accurate and comprehensive.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- There are no security concerns with this code snippet.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type        | Score | Justification                                              |\n|-------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0      | No malicious behavior detected.                              |\n| Obfuscated        | 0      | Code is straightforward class definitions, no obfuscation. |\n| Security Risk     | 0      | No vulnerabilities or risky behaviors present.             |\n\nThis concludes the review.",
