{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the power-grid-model library to handle various error scenarios.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; all error classes are defined statically within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks—no data flows or external outputs are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow pathways; the code only declares classes and attributes without execution flow.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of class attributes with type annotations inside class bodies; no actual assignment or logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for various error types, inheriting from built-in exceptions and each other. No input/output, data processing, or dynamic code execution is present. The attributes like 'failed_scenarios' and 'error_messages' are declared but not initialized or used within methods, indicating these are merely type hints for future use or documentation. No obfuscated code, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are detected. The code structure aligns with standard Python practices for defining custom exceptions. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or supply chain attack vectors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of custom exception class definitions for error handling in a power grid modeling library. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data flow, and no security risks. It appears safe and intentionally designed for error classification.",
