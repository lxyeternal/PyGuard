{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for error handling within the power-grid-model library.",
  "sources": "Import of numpy as np.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input/output points identified.",
  "flows": "None, as the code only defines exception classes and does not process data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward class definitions with no unusual constructs or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only class definitions for error handling, including inheritance and type annotations. There are no functions, no data input/output, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious logic. All classes are standard exception subclasses with docstrings. The import of numpy is typical for handling arrays and does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The structure and content are consistent with normal library error class definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical set of custom exception classes for a library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any data handling, network operations, or system modifications. The likelihood of malicious intent is extremely low.",
