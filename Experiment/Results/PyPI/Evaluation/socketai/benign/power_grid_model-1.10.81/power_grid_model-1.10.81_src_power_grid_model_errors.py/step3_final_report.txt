{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for error handling in the power-grid-model library.",
  "sources": "Class attribute declarations with type annotations, import of numpy for type hints.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output, network activity, or external data handling.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; only class definitions with type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of class attributes with type annotations but no initialization or methods; no malicious or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from standard Python error classes. The numpy import is used only for type annotations, with no data processing or dynamic code. Attributes are declared but not used, serving as documentation or placeholders. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is syntactically correct and follows standard practices for defining exception classes. The absence of executable logic, data handling, or network activity indicates no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for defining custom exceptions, and poses no security threat. The scores assigned in the reports—malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0—are appropriate and consistent with the code's characteristics.",
