  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, structure, and potential security implications.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is purely class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from standard Python error classes.\n- No executable code, data processing, input/output handling, or network activity.\n- The import of numpy is only used for type annotations; no data manipulation or logic involving numpy arrays.\n- Class attributes with type annotations are declared but not initialized or used in methods, indicating they serve as documentation or placeholders.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious patterns.\n- The code aligns with standard practices for defining custom exceptions in Python libraries.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n\n- **Presence of class attributes with type annotations**: These are not problematic per se but suggest that in actual implementation, these attributes might be initialized or used. Their presence alone does not introduce security risks.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n\n- **No functional logic or methods**: While not an error, the classes are purely declarative. This is typical for exception classes, but if the attributes are meant to be used, they should be initialized or documented accordingly. However, this does not impact security.\n\n### Scores and their reasonableness:\n\n- **Malware score**: All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score**: All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Risk score**: All reports assign 0.5 or below, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- The reports correctly identify that there is no malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation.\n- The only minor point is that the presence of class attributes with type annotations, without initialization, could be flagged as a potential issue if the code were to be used maliciously to inject hidden data. However, in this context, they are harmless and standard for documentation purposes.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **The code is safe, standard, and does not pose any security risks.**\n- **The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the content.**\n- **No changes are necessary to the scores or conclusions.**\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (clear, straightforward class definitions)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall, this code is purely boilerplate exception class definitions for a library, with no malicious or security concern.**",
