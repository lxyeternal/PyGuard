{
  "purpose": "Define custom error classes for the power-grid-model library, facilitating error handling and categorization.",
  "sources": "Import of numpy library for handling array types; no input data sources in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted inputs; the classes are purely for error categorization and do not process data directly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; the code solely defines error classes with no dynamic or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions inheriting from standard error types, with type annotations for some attributes. There are no input/output operations, data handling, network activity, or code execution commands. The use of numpy is limited to type annotation and does not imply malicious intent. The classes are well-structured for error handling in a larger application, and no malicious or suspicious elements are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of error class definitions for a power grid modeling library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
