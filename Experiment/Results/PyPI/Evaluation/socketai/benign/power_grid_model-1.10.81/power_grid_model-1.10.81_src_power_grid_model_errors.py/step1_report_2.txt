{
  "purpose": "Define custom error classes for the power-grid-model library to handle various exceptions.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes and imports numpy.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, input/output, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow from sources to sinks as there are no input or output operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code appears to be standard class definitions for exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports numpy and defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from RuntimeError or other custom errors. These classes include class variables with type annotations, but no methods or executable code. No input, output, or data handling occurs. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. All classes are for error handling specific to power grid modeling, with clear and appropriate naming.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward class definitions for custom exceptions in a power grid modeling library. It shows no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It is standard boilerplate code for error handling, with no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
