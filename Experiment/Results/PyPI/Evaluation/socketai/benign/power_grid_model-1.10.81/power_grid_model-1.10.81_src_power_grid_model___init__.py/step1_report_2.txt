  "purpose": "Import statements for the Power Grid Model package, setting up dependencies and enums for power grid simulation and analysis.",
  "sources": "Imports from the 'power_grid_model' package modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data; no data processing or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "The code only imports modules and constants; there are no data flows or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns observed. The license headers and import statements are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only import statements, licensing comments, and a docstring. No executable logic, data processing, network communication, or sensitive operations are present. There are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. The imports suggest a modular design for a power grid modeling library but do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard library import statements for a power grid modeling project. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a typical setup code for a larger application or library.",
