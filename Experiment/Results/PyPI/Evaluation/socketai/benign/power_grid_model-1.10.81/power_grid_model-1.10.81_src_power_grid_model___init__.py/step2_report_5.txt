  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\nAll reports describe the code as merely a set of static import statements from the 'power_grid_model' package, with no dynamic execution, data processing, network activity, or suspicious constructs. They consistently conclude that the code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  **No.** The code is purely static import statements with no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in Logic:\n- **Logical flaws?**  \n  **None.** The reports correctly identify that the code is just dependency imports and makes no unwarranted assumptions.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`, which is appropriate. There is no malicious behavior, code injection, or backdoor present.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`, which is correct. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n\n- **Risk Score:**  \n  All reports assign `0` (or very close to it). Given the absence of any dynamic or risky operations, this is justified.\n\n### Challenging Claims and Assumptions:\n- The reports assume that static import statements are inherently safe, which is reasonable. No evidence suggests otherwise.\n\n### Consistency of Scores:\n- The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- The code is purely static imports with no execution, data handling, or external communication.  \n- No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.  \n- The package appears to be a domain-specific library for power grid modeling, and the import statements are standard.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign and does not pose any security risk. The reports are accurate, and no changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nAll assessments are appropriate given the code snippet.",
