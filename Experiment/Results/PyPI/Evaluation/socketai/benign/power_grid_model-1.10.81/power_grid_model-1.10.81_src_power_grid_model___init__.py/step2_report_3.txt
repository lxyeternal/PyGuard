  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Malware:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is solely composed of static import statements with no dynamic execution, data processing, or network communication.\n   - No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors are identified.\n   - The code is purely declarative, serving as setup dependencies for a larger project.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that there are no functional or security flaws in this static import snippet.\n   - The logic and reasoning are sound; no misinterpretations or assumptions are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Assigned:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0\n   - These are consistent with the analysis that this code is benign.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all evidence points to benign static imports with no malicious activity, there is no justification for high risk scores.\n   - The risk scores are appropriately set to zero.\n\n5. **Potential Vulnerabilities Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as harmless.\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities are based on unfounded assumptions.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - The confidence levels are high (1.0), reflecting certainty in the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Clear, static import statements with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** **0** — No security risks identified.\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThis code snippet is a standard, benign set of import statements for a power grid modeling library. It does not pose any security threat or contain malicious code.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese align with the consensus of the reports and the detailed analysis.",
