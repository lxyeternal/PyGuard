  "purpose": "Import statements for the Power Grid Model project, including various modules, classes, and enumerations used within the package.",
  "sources": "The imported modules and classes, which are from the 'power_grid_model' package and are static references; no external input or data reading is observed.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data are present in this snippet; no network, file, or environment variable operations are performed.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks within this code snippet; it's purely import statements establishing module dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious constructs; all imports are from the same package and are static references with no dynamic execution or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "This code contains only import statements that include classes, functions, and constants from a local package 'power_grid_model'. It adheres to standard Python import syntax with no apparent dynamic execution, data handling, or malicious constructs. There are no sources of untrusted data, no sinks where such data could be exploited, and no evident flows. The code is purely declarative, setting up dependencies for further processing.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign code snippet consisting solely of import statements, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be part of a larger project setup and does not perform any data processing or external interactions that could pose a security threat.",
