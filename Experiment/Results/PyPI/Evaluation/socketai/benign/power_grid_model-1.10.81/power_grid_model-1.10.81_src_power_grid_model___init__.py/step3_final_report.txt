  "purpose": "Static import statements for the power grid modeling library, setting up dependencies for a larger project.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'power_grid_model' package modules.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static dependency setup only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from a domain-specific library related to power grid modeling. There are no functions, data processing, network communication, environment variable access, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is purely declarative, serving as dependency setup, which is a common benign pattern. All reports correctly identify the code as static, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, obfuscated score to 0, and risk score to 0, with high confidence. No signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of static import statements for a power grid modeling library. It poses no security threat, contains no malicious code, and is free of obfuscation. The assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
