  "purpose": "Import statements for the Power Grid Model project, setting up dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Code reads package modules and specific components from the power_grid_model package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or input/output operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only static imports are used.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for various modules and components within a package. There are no functions, data processing, or dynamic code execution. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code, such as code injection, network activity, or credential handling. The imports are from the 'power_grid_model' package, which appears to be a structured, domain-specific library related to power grid modeling. All elements seem to be standard package dependencies and metadata definitions, with no malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is purely declarative, importing modules from a known package. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is benign, serving as setup or configuration for a larger application.",
