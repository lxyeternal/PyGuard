  "purpose": "Build configuration script for a Python package with C++ extensions, managing dependencies, platform-specific flags, and packaging.",
  "sources": "Dependency imports, environment variables (e.g., CXX, POWER_GRID_MODEL_NO_BINARY_BUILD), filesystem paths for cleanup, and build setup functions.",
  "sinks": "Environment variables influencing build flags and behavior, filesystem operations (binary removal), and dependency inclusion.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (environment variables, dependency modules) influence build flags and cleanup operations, affecting the build process and output.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables (e.g., CXX, POWER_GRID_MODEL_NO_BINARY_BUILD) to control build behavior, which could be exploited to hide malicious extensions or alter build outputs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard build setup for a Python package with C++ extensions, involving dependency management, platform detection, cleanup, and packaging. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The reliance on environment variables for build configuration is typical but introduces a minimal security risk if manipulated maliciously. The code's logic is straightforward, and no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation are evident. The potential for misuse of environment variables is acknowledged but does not constitute malicious activity in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, well-structured build configuration with no malicious behavior. The low risk score reflects typical concerns associated with environment variable manipulation in build systems but does not indicate actual malicious activity.",
