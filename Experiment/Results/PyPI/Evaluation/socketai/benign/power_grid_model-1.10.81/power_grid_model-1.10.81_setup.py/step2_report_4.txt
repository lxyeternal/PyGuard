  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Summary:** The script is a typical build setup, handling dependencies, platform-specific flags, and packaging. No suspicious code or malicious behavior is observed.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** This is consistent. The reasoning is sound; no issues found.  \n- **Conclusion:** The code appears safe and standard. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing dependency management and platform-specific build logic. No malicious behavior detected.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.  \n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score (0.1) due to the conditional build logic and environment variables, which could theoretically be exploited to hide malicious extensions.  \n- **Justification:** While no malicious activity is present, the ability to disable or modify build behavior via environment variables introduces a minimal risk.  \n- **Recommendation:** The risk score of 0.1 seems reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Summary:** The script manages build configuration with environment variables that influence compilation flags and binary removal. It notes potential exploitation if environment variables are maliciously manipulated but finds no actual malicious code.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.  \n- **Assessment:** The slightly higher risk score reflects awareness that environment variables controlling build behavior could be misused.  \n- **Justification:** The risk score of 0.2 is appropriate given the potential for malicious manipulation, even if not currently exploited.  \n- **Recommendation:** The score seems justified; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing standard build setup, dependency handling, and cleanup. No malicious behavior or suspicious code.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the content. The reliance on environment variables for build configuration is noted but not inherently malicious.  \n- **Recommendation:** The risk score is appropriate; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Summary:** Standard build configuration, platform detection, dependency management, no suspicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code. No malicious behavior detected.  \n- **Recommendation:** The score is reasonable; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is justified. The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variations (0.1 or 0.2) are justified due to the use of environment variables that influence build behavior, which could be exploited if manipulated maliciously.\n\n### My Final Estimation:\n- **Malware:** **0** — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is transparent and well-structured.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — low, but acknowledging potential misuse of environment variables to alter build behavior or hide malicious extensions.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured build setup script with no malicious intent. The minor risk associated with environment variable manipulation is typical in build systems and does not indicate malicious activity. The scores are appropriate and consistent across reports.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware=0, obfuscated=0.  \n- Set risk=0.1 to reflect minimal but acknowledged potential for misuse.",
