  "purpose": "Static type hint definitions and import statements for the power-grid-model library, intended solely for static analysis and type safety.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules, defining type aliases and descriptive comments.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or handle untrusted data or perform runtime actions.",
  "flows": "N/A; static code with no data flow or execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static type hinting with clear, readable code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists exclusively of import statements, type alias definitions, and descriptive comments. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or dynamic execution. The code is static and intended for type checking, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with its static, benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static setup for type hints with no malicious or suspicious elements. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
