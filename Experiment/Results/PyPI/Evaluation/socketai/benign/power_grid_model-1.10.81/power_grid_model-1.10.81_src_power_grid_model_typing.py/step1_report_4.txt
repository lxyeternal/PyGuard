{
  "purpose": "The code provides type hints and imports for the power-grid-model library, defining data structures and type aliases for component attributes.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (_core.dataset_definitions, _core.power_grid_meta, enum) and local variable definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or outputs; no external data handling, network communication, or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily establishes type annotations and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns. No dynamic code execution or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of static type annotations, import statements, and variable definitions for type hinting. All imported modules are from the same package, with no external or untrusted data inputs or outputs. No network activity, data processing, or user interaction is present. The code appears to be well-structured, standard, and without suspicious logic or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard type hinting and import setup for a Python library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and benign.",
