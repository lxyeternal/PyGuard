  "purpose": "Type hint definitions for the power-grid-model library, including various imported types and a custom type alias.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (`power_grid_model._core.dataset_definitions`, `power_grid_model._core.power_grid_meta`, `power_grid_model.enum`) and the local variable `_ComponentAttributeMappingDict`.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, output, or external effects detected; the code mainly defines type hints.",
  "flows": "The type alias `ComponentAttributeMapping` uses data types from imported modules, but no dynamic data flow or untrusted input processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. The code uses standard Python type hints and static imports, with no code execution or data manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines type hints and imports types from internal modules to support static type checking. There are no functions, user inputs, data processing, or system interactions. The import statements are standard and include pylint disable comments, which are common in static code. The variable `_ComponentAttributeMappingDict` is a type hint for a dictionary with complex key-value types, but it doesn't perform any dynamic or malicious actions. Overall, the code is straightforward, static, and adheres to typical Python type hinting practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for type hinting and static analysis purposes. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a standard part of a library's static typing infrastructure.",
