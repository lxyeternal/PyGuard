  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to verify the claims and ensure the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code is for type hints and imports from internal modules. No data processing.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The report correctly states that the code is static, purely for type hinting, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. These are appropriate given the static nature and lack of suspicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, defining type hints and data structures.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No dynamic data handling, no external effects, and standard practices are observed.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines type hints, imports, and a complex type alias.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Again, static type hinting with no data processing or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Correctly assessed. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar static type hinting and import statements.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines type hints and data structures, no runtime code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Static, safe, standard practice.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is static, purely for type hinting, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the absence of any malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n- Security risk scores are 0, as there's no indication of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. The code appears safe, static, and intended solely for type hinting and static analysis purposes.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risk exists in this code snippet. The assessments are consistent and justified.",
