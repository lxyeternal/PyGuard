{
  "purpose": "The code provides type hints and imports for the power-grid-model library, defining data structures and type aliases for component attributes and metadata.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (`power_grid_model._core.dataset_definitions`, `power_grid_model._core.power_grid_meta`, `power_grid_model.enum`) and local variable assignment (`_ComponentAttributeMappingDict`, `ComponentAttributeMapping`).",
  "sinks": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code primarily defines type hints and imports without executing untrusted data or performing I/O operations.",
  "flows": "N/A - No runtime data flow occurs; only static type definitions and imports are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns detected; the code is standard for type hinting and module importation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and types from internal modules related to dataset definitions and metadata, used for type hinting in a larger project. It defines a dictionary type `_ComponentAttributeMappingDict` and a union type `ComponentAttributeMapping` for flexible attribute mapping. No dynamic execution, input handling, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured static type hinting module without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign type hinting module used for static analysis and type safety within the power-grid-model library. It contains no suspicious or malicious behavior, no data leaks, and no external code execution. Overall, it is safe with no security risks.",
