  "purpose": "Provide type hints and import necessary components for the power-grid-model library.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules, definitions of type hint variables.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; mainly static type hint definitions and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. Imports are from known library modules, no dynamic execution, no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, type hint definitions, and descriptive comments. No external data is read, no user input is processed, and no sensitive operations are performed. The type hinting and import structure are standard and do not suggest malicious intent. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard type hint and import setup for a Python library, with no malicious or suspicious elements. It appears safe and intended for static type checking only.",
