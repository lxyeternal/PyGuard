  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine if the conclusions are justified based on the code.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code consists solely of import statements, type alias definitions, and descriptive comments.\n- No data processing, user input, network activity, or external data handling is present.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are evident.\n- The code is static and purely for type hinting, which is standard in Python projects.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n**Purpose:** Import and type hint definitions.\n\n**Analysis & Conclusion:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a static setup for type hints, with no malicious intent.\n\n**Risk & Malware Scores:** Both at 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n**Purpose:** Define type hints and data structures.\n\n**Analysis & Conclusion:** The assessment is correct; the code is purely structural, with no runtime effects or malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:** Both 0, fitting the code.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n**Purpose:** Type hint definitions, type aliases.\n\n**Analysis & Conclusion:** The review is consistent; the code is static, no data flow or dynamic behavior.\n\n**Scores:** Both 0, appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n**Purpose:** Type hints and imports for data structures.\n\n**Analysis & Conclusion:** The code remains static, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:** Both 0, justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n**Purpose:** Type hints and attribute mappings.\n\n**Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is purely static, with no runtime or external effects.\n\n**Scores:** Both 0, fitting.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward static code.\n- **Security Risk:** All are 0, which is justified.\n\n**Potential Discrepancies:** None observed. The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **My Final Expert Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0 — No security risk present.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard static type hinting setup with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The reports are thorough and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No further action needed. The supply chain security risk for this code is negligible.",
