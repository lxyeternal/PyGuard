{
  "purpose": "Define type hints and data structures for the power-grid-model library, including imports and type aliasing.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules, including dataset definitions, metadata, and enum classes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code mainly sets type hints and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed. The type aliasing appears standard for type hinting.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, type alias definitions, and documentation comments for type hints. It does not process user input, read external data, or perform any actions that could lead to data leakage, injection, or malicious behavior. There are no network calls, file operations, or other side effects. The type hints and comments are consistent with standard Python practices for type annotations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of type hint definitions and imports for documentation and static analysis purposes. No malicious activity, supply chain attacks, or security risks are detected. It appears safe and purely structural.",
