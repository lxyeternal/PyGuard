It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements. The low malware score (0) and obfuscation score (0) are appropriate, and the minimal security risk score (~0.1) reflects its focus on data integrity. Overall, the code is safe for supply chain use, with no signs of malicious activity or security issues."

It functions as a standard serialization/deserialization wrapper around trusted native libraries. The low security risk score (around 0.1) is justified, assuming external C dependencies are trustworthy."
