  "purpose": "Define common enumeration types used in the power-grid-model library for modeling power system components and calculations.",
  "sources": "Import of enum module, class definitions for various enumeration types",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input handling or data output functions present",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code consists solely of enum definitions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. All code appears to be straightforward enum declarations with descriptive comments.",
  "analysis": "The code only declares various IntEnum classes to represent constants used within a power grid modeling library. There are no functions, data input/output, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or system modifications are present. The code includes detailed comments for each enum member, which suggests clarity and intent for maintainability. Overall, the code is a standard enum definitions module with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign, well-structured set of enumeration definitions for a power grid modeling library. It contains no malicious code, data leaks, or security risks. The code serves its purpose of defining constants and does not introduce any security vulnerabilities.",
