  "purpose": "Defines common enumerations for the power-grid-model library used in power grid simulations and analysis.",
  "sources": "Imports enum module, defines enumeration classes with constant values.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or data sinks are present in the code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code solely defines constants and enums without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hidden code, or obfuscation detected. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious constructs. The enums are straightforward and match standard power grid parameters.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of enumeration class definitions, each representing specific categories and options for power grid modeling. No input handling, data processing, or external interactions are present. The enums are static, with no dynamic code, execution, or external resource calls. The presence of detailed docstrings and clear constant definitions indicates a benign purpose aligned with modeling standards. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of enumeration definitions used for modeling power grid components and parameters. It appears to be clean, non-malicious, and solely intended for domain-specific use. No security issues or malicious activity detected.",
