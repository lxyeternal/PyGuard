{
  "purpose": "Define various enumerations used within the power-grid-model library for power system simulations and analyses.",
  "sources": "Import of enum module, definition of multiple IntEnum classes and their members",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data outputs, only enum definitions with static values",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data inputs; code solely defines static enums",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of enumeration class definitions that map descriptive labels to constant integer values. The enum names and values appear to be designed for consistency with a C++ core, and the comments clarify their purpose. There are no data inputs, outputs, or runtime behaviors. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious logic is present. The code is static and appears to be part of a library's type definitions, with no malicious or security-risk behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of enumeration definitions intended for use in a power grid modeling library. It contains no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is purely static, well-structured, and documented. No potential security threats or malicious intent are detected.",
