  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checkting the code content, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as straightforward enum definitions for a power grid modeling library.\n- No dynamic code, data handling, or external interactions are present.\n- The enums match standard domain-specific constants.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected.\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1, with malware and security risk scores at 0, which is consistent given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code contains only enum class definitions with static values. There are no input handling, data processing, or network operations.\n- No vulnerabilities, backdoors, or malicious constructs are present.\n- The code's purpose is purely definitional for modeling purposes.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; no logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign malware and security risk scores as 0, which is justified.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, matching the absence of obfuscation.\n- Confidence is 1, as the analysis is thorough and consistent.\n\n### Justifications:\n- Since the code is purely enum definitions with no runtime or external interactions, a malware score > 0 would be unwarranted.\n- The detailed comments and matching domain standards reinforce the benign nature.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code is static and standard.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a standard, well-documented set of enumeration classes for a power grid modeling library. No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior is present.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- All reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The code is benign, with no security issues.\n- The scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: **malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0**.",
