{
  "purpose": "Defines common enumerations for the power-grid-model library, including types related to loads, transformers, branches, calculations, faults, and measurement types.",
  "sources": "Imports enum module; class definitions with constant integer values; comments describing each enumeration and member.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted input or data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A - No data flow or processing occurs; the code only defines static enums.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or dynamic execution. The constants are standard and match typical enumeration patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of enumeration classes used for categorizing various power system elements and parameters. It contains descriptive comments and no signs of malicious intent. There are no dynamic code executions, input handling, or external data operations. The constants are all integer values that correspond to standard enumerations, and the code is clean and well-structured. No anomalies, obfuscated logic, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard enumeration definition module for a power system modeling library. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe and purely declarative.",
