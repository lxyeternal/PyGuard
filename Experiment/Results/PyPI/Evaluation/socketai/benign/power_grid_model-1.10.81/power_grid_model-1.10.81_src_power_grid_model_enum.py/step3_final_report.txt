{
  "purpose": "Defines enumerations for power grid modeling parameters, matching C++ core values for consistency.",
  "sources": "Enum class definitions with static constant values, no input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external outputs; purely static definitions.",
  "flows": "N/A - static enum definitions without data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, well-documented enum classes.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of enum class definitions representing various power grid components and parameters. It contains no dynamic code, input handling, or external dependencies. The comments clarify purpose and match standard domain values. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present. The code is static, domain-specific, and intended for use as constants in larger applications. Given these observations, there is no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and purely definitional with no malicious or security concerns. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all appropriately set to 0, with high confidence. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
