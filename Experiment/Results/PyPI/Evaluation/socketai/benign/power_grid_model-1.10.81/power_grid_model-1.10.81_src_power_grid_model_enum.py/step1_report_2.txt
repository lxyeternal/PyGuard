{
  "purpose": "Defines various enumeration classes used in the power-grid-model library for representing types, strategies, and measurement categories in power grid modeling.",
  "sources": "Imports 'enum' module; class definitions with enum members and associated comments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, no data handling or I/O operations, no network activity, and no sensitive data processing observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely defines enumerations without runtime data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward enum definitions with descriptive comments. No obfuscated patterns, hidden code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily comprises class definitions inheriting from IntEnum, providing named constants for various power grid parameters. It includes descriptive comments for each enum and member, which aid understanding. There are no functions, dynamic code execution, or data processing logic. The presence of detailed comments and standard enum patterns suggests benign intent. No hardcoded secrets, network operations, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of enumeration definitions for a power grid modeling library. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no security risks. It is purely definitional with no active or risky operations.",
