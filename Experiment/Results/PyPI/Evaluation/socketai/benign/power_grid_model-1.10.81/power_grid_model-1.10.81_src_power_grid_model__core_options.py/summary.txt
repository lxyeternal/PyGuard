  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard wrapper around external C functions for options management. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The low risk score is appropriate, with a very minimal concern due to reliance on external core functions. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use."
