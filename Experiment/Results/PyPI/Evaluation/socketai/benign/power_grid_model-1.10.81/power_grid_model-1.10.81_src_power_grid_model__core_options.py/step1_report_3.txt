{
  "purpose": "Defines classes for managing power grid options, wrapping underlying C/C++ functions for setting various parameters.",
  "sources": "Imports from external modules: 'power_grid_model._core.power_grid_core', particularly functions like 'create_options', 'destroy_options', and various 'set_' functions.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flow to external systems, no network or file operations, and no handling of untrusted input or output.",
  "flows": "Initialization of 'Options' instance calls 'create_options' (source) and assigns to '_opt'. Setter methods invoke underlying 'set_' functions (sinks) with parameter data. No untrusted data flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behaviors such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. The code strictly manages options through well-defined setters and does not include malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a wrapper around external C/C++ functions for managing power grid options, including creation, destruction, and setting parameters. It uses a class-based structure with property decorators and custom setters. No external input handling, network communication, or file I/O is present. The functions invoked are typical for C bindings. The code appears to be standard wrapper code for a C library, with no signs of malicious intent, suspicious behaviors, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign wrapper for external C functions managing power grid options. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected. It functions as intended for its purpose of managing configuration options.",
