{
  "purpose": "Defines an Options class with associated OptionSetter for managing configuration options in a power grid model.",
  "sources": "Imports from power_grid_model._core.power_grid_core, specifically functions and classes such as create_options, destroy_options, and setter functions like set_calculation_type.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data handling, network operations, or external data processing observed.",
  "flows": "The Options class creates an options pointer via pgc.create_options(), then sets various options through the OptionSetter instances which call corresponding pgc.set_* functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior; the code primarily wraps C API functions for options management. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a wrapper around C API functions for options management in a power grid model. It initializes options through pgc.create_options() and destroys them upon deletion. The OptionSetter class enables setting various options via corresponding setter functions from the pgc module. No external data input, network activity, or suspicious operations are present. The code is straightforward, primarily interfacing with a native extension, with proper encapsulation. There are no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard wrapper for managing options in a power grid modeling system. It performs no malicious actions, does not handle untrusted data insecurely, and contains no obfuscated or suspicious logic. Overall, it appears safe and legitimate.",
