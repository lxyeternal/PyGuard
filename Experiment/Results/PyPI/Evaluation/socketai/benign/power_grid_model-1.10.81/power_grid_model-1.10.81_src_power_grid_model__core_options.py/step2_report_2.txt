  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a wrapper around C API functions from `power_grid_model._core.power_grid_core`.\n- It manages options creation/destruction and setting various parameters.\n- No untrusted data handling, network operations, or external data processing is present.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are evident.\n- The functions invoked are typical for C bindings and appear benign.\n- The resource management (creation/destruction) is standard, though reliance on `__del__` can sometimes be problematic if exceptions occur, but this is not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Report-by-report review**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Accurate; straightforward wrapper, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `securityRisk=0`, `confidence=1`.\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned; no issues. \n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Similar to Report 1; safe wrapper, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `securityRisk=0`, `confidence=0.9`.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly less confident but still reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same as above; standard wrapper, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `securityRisk=0`, `confidence=1`.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem correct.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Noted that the core functions could be malicious if they are, but the code itself is just a wrapper.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly higher at 0.2, which is cautious but acceptable.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `securityRisk=0.2`, `confidence=0.9`.\n- **Assessment:** The risk score of 0.2 is cautious but reasonable, given that the core functions could theoretically be malicious if compromised.\n\n**Verdict:** The score is justified, but perhaps slightly conservative. If the core library is trusted, the risk could be lowered further, but given the information, it's acceptable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Similar to others; standard interface, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `securityRisk=0.2`, `confidence=0.9`.\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable, considering the external core functions.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious code is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Mostly 0 or 0.2, reflecting minimal or low security risk, which is appropriate for wrapper code relying on external trusted libraries.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- The **security risk scores** of 0.2 in reports 4 and 5 are acceptable but could be lowered to 0 if the core library is fully trusted and verified. However, without explicit trust, a cautious 0.2 is justified.\n- The **malware and obfuscated scores** are correctly assigned as 0 across all reports.\n- The **confidence scores** are reasonable, given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (low, depending on trust in external core library)\n\n**Summary:** The code appears safe, with scores appropriately reflecting the lack of malicious activity or obfuscation. The only caveat is the reliance on external C functions; if those are compromised, risks could arise, but from this code alone, the security posture is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Continue to verify the integrity and trustworthiness of the core library (`power_grid_model._core.power_grid_core`) to ensure overall security.",
