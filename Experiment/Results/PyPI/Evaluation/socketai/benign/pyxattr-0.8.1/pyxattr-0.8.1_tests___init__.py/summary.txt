  "conclusion": "Most reports indicate benign code with appropriate low scores. Report 4 shows suspicious patterns, justifying higher scores, but in the absence of actual code, these should be moderated. Overall, the scoring aligns with the evidence and descriptions provided. No significant adjustments are necessary, but moderation of high suspicion scores in Report 4 is advisable."
