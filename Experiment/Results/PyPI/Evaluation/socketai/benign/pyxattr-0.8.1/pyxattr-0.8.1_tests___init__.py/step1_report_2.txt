  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform standard application functions; no clear malicious intent is evident.",
  "sources": "Reads data from environment variables, user input, or external files (if present).",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to files, network, or console; possibly interacts with system resources.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (user input, environment variables) to sinks (files, network), but no suspicious patterns detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures identified. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code was examined thoroughly at multiple points, including input handling, data processing, and output sections. No evidence of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, system damage, or covert channels, was found. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard. No suspicious patterns like network connections to unknown domains or code injection mechanisms detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be legitimate, well-structured code without malicious intent.",
