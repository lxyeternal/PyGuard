{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for building and distributing a Python C extension module called 'pyxattr', which manipulates filesystem extended attributes.",
  "sources": "Reading configuration data such as package metadata, version, author info, URLs, and dependency imports.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no code execution, data exfiltration, or network activity is observed.",
  "flows": "The script primarily flows from static configuration data to the setup() function, with no dynamic or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns detected. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules for setup, defines package metadata and extension configuration, and calls setup() with static data. There are no indications of malicious behavior or suspicious logic. The use of macros for version and author info is standard. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or external network interactions are present. The code appears to be a typical setup script for a Python C extension.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup configuration for a Python package without malicious intent or security risks.",
