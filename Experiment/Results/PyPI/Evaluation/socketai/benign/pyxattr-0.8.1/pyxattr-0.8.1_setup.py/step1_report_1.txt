{
  "purpose": "To define and configure the setup for building a Python C extension module called 'pyxattr', which provides extended attributes manipulation for filesystems.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from import statements, string definitions, and setup configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data such as author_email and URL fields are used, but they are not untrusted input; no external data or user input is processed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from static variables (version, author, author_email) into macros and setup parameters; no untrusted sources or external input flow into critical code paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears to be standard setup script for a Python C extension module with no suspicious logic, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules for package setup, defines package metadata, and configures the build process for a C extension. It does not include any dynamic code execution, user input handling, network activity, or embedded scripts. All data is statically defined, and the code's structure is typical of Python extension modules. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python C extension package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It purely facilitates building and distributing the package without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
