{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for building a Python C extension module named 'pyxattr'. It defines package metadata and build configuration for the extension.",
  "sources": "Static metadata definitions (author, email, version, URLs), source file 'xattr.c', macros embedding version and author info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external inputs; no sinks that could lead to data leaks or execution effects.",
  "flows": "Static data assigned to macros and parameters; no dynamic data flow or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and follows standard packaging patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools, defines package metadata, and configures the extension build with static parameters. It contains no user input, network activity, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution. The macros embed static metadata into the extension. All data is hardcoded, and the structure is typical for a Python extension package setup. No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard setup script for a Python C extension module with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's static and benign nature.",
