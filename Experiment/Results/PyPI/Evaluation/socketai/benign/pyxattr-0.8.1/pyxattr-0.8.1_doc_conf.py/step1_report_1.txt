  "sources": "Import statements (`import sys, os`), sys.path modification (`sys.path.insert`), and configuration variables setting.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that handle untrusted data or perform insecure operations. No network, file, or data leakage sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks. The code is solely configuration for documentation generation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code appears to be standard documentation setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file, setting up project info, extensions, output options, and paths. It does not contain any dynamic code execution, network operations, or handling of untrusted input. All variables and imports are related to documentation build settings. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious logic are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign, standard configuration file for Sphinx documentation generation with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
