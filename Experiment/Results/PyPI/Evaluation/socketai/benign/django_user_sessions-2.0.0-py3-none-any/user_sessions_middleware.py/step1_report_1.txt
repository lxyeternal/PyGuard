  "purpose": "Middleware for managing user sessions, setting cookies with session data including IP and user agent.",
  "sources": "Reads request data such as COOKIES, META (REMOTE_ADDR, HTTP_USER_AGENT), and session engine configurations.",
  "sinks": "Sets session cookies via response.set_cookie, saves session data with request.session.save()",
  "flows": "Request data (COOKIES, META) -> SessionStore initialization -> Session modification -> Response cookie setting",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious external calls, or malicious patterns detected. The code uses standard Django session management practices.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, handles potential import errors gracefully, and manages session data by incorporating IP and user agent information. It saves session data conditionally and sets cookies securely based on settings. The logic appears consistent with typical Django middleware for session handling, with no signs of malicious data exfiltration or backdoors. There are no unusual dynamic code executions, obfuscated parts, or external network calls. The overall structure follows standard practices without anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a standard Django session middleware with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It securely manages session cookies and data without any suspicious patterns.",
