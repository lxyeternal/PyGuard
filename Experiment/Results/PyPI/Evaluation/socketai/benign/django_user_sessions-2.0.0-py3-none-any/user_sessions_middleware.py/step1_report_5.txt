  "purpose": "Middleware for managing user sessions in a Django web application, attaching IP and user-agent info, and handling session cookies.",
  "sources": "Reading request cookies, request metadata (REMOTE_ADDR, HTTP_USER_AGENT), session engine module, and session data via request.session.",
  "sinks": "Setting session cookies in HTTP response with potential sensitive session data.",
  "flows": "Request cookies -> request.session initialization -> session modifications -> response.set_cookie with session key and data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; no unusual or suspicious functions; no external network activity; no data exfiltration or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django middleware implementation for session management. It imports modules conditionally based on Django version, uses request and response objects securely, and handles session data and cookies properly. The session data is stored and retrieved from the configured session engine. The code correctly manages session expiration, cookie attributes, and headers without any signs of malicious intent or unusual behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, standard Django session middleware implementation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It properly manages session cookies and data without exposing sensitive information or executing malicious actions.",
