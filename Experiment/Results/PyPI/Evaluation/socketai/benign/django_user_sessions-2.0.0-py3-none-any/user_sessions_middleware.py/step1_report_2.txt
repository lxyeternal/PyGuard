  "purpose": "Middleware to manage user sessions by storing IP, user agent, and session data, and setting session cookies in Django.",
  "sources": "Request headers (REMOTE_ADDR, HTTP_USER_AGENT), request.COOKIES, session store methods, settings variables.",
  "sinks": "response.set_cookie() method, session store.save() method.",
  "flows": "Request headers -> session store initialization; Session modification -> response.set_cookie with session key; Saving session data -> response.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; standard Django session handling. No suspicious code or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Django middleware implementation for session management. It reads request headers to initialize session data and conditionally saves session info and sets cookies on response. No suspicious or malicious activities such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are present. All functions appear to follow standard practices for session handling. The code lacks any external network communication, obfuscated logic, or hidden behaviors that could indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate Django session middleware with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It adheres to typical session management patterns without any anomalies or backdoors.",
