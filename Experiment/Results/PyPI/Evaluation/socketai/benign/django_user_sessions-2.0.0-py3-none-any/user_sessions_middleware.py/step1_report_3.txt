  "purpose": "Middleware to manage user sessions by storing IP and user agent information, and handling session cookies.",
  "sources": "Request cookies (request.COOKIES), request metadata (request.META), session storage (engine.SessionStore), settings (settings.*), and response object.",
  "sinks": "response.set_cookie, request.session.save, and patch_vary_headers (modifies response headers).",
  "flows": "Request cookies and meta data -> request.session initialization -> session modification -> response.set_cookie with session data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. Use of deprecated importlib fallback is standard. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. No dynamic code execution, no suspicious domain connections, or data exfiltration detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard Django session middleware with added tracking of IP and user agent data in the session store. It loads session data from cookies, updates session state, and sets cookies in the response. The code checks for session modification before saving and setting cookies, avoiding unnecessary operations. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or privacy violations are present. The only potential concern could be if session data is improperly handled elsewhere, but within this code, it appears standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of session management middleware with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It handles sessions responsibly and securely, with no evidence of sabotage or malware.",
