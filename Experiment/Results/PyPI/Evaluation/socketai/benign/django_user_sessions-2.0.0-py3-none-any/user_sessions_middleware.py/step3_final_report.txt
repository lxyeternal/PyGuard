  "purpose": "Django middleware managing sessions, capturing IP and user-agent, and setting session cookies securely.",
  "sources": "Request cookies (COOKIES), request META data (REMOTE_ADDR, HTTP_USER_AGENT), session store initialization.",
  "sinks": "Response cookies (set_cookie), session.save() which writes session data to storage.",
  "flows": "Request data (COOKIES, META) → session store initialization → session modification → response cookie setting and session saving.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code follows standard Django practices with fallback imports for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of Django session middleware, adding IP and user-agent info to session data, handling session expiration, and setting cookies accordingly. It avoids obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious external calls. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security flaws are evident. The fallback imports are standard for compatibility. The session is only saved if modified or configured to always save, and cookies are set with security options based on settings. The code does not perform any network activity or data exfiltration. Overall, it is a benign, well-structured component.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure Django session middleware with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
