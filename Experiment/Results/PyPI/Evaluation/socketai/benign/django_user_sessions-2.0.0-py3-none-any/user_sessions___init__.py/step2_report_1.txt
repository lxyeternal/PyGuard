  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Reports 1-4:**\n\n- All four reports describe the same code snippet: attempting to retrieve the version of the 'django-user-sessions' package using `pkg_resources.get_distribution()`, with exception handling for `DistributionNotFound`. They conclude that the code is straightforward, standard, and contains no malicious activity.\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code is correct and aligns with the described purpose. No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are identified.\n\n- **Malware assessment:** The malware score is 0 in all four, which is consistent. The code does not perform any malicious actions—no network activity, no data exfiltration, no code injection, no suspicious logic.\n\n- **Security risk:** The risk score is 0 or very close to it (0.1 in report 4), which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Scores:** The scores assigned seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Contains a JSON parse error, but the embedded content repeats the same analysis as reports 1-4, emphasizing that the code is standard, safe, and without malicious intent.\n\n- The detailed analysis confirms no signs of malware or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** The malware score is 0, and security risk is 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence:** The code is present and correctly described in all reports.\n\n- **Malware and obfuscation:** No signs of malware or obfuscation are present. The code is a simple version check.\n\n- **Risk scores:** The assigned scores are appropriate. The security risk is minimal, and malware is zero.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The only possible concern could be if this code were part of a larger malicious payload, but as a standalone snippet, it’s benign.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at 0, as the code is straightforward.\n\n- **Risk score:** Should stay at 0 or very close to it (e.g., 0.1), reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n### Overall conclusion:\n\nThe code is a standard, safe utility snippet for version detection with no malicious intent. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** No changes are necessary; the reports are accurate in their assessments.",
