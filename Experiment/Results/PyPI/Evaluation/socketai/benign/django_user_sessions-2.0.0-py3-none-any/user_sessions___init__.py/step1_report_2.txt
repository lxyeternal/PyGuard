  "purpose": "Retrieve the version of the 'django-user-sessions' package if installed.",
  "sources": "get_distribution function from pkg_resources, reading the package version; exception handling for DistributionNotFound.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or output vulnerabilities detected.",
  "flows": "Calling get_distribution to obtain package version; fallback to setting __version__ to None if package not found.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious behavior observed; straightforward version retrieval with standard exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to get the version of a specific package using pkg_resources. It correctly handles the case where the package is not installed by setting __version__ to None. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behavior is present. The code relies on standard library functions and proper exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, standard dependency version check with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
