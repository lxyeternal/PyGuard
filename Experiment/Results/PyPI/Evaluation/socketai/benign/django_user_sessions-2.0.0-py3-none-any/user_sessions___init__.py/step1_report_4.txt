  "purpose": "Retrieve the version information of the 'django-user-sessions' package if installed.",
  "sources": "get_distribution('django-user-sessions').version in the try block",
  "sinks": "None present; no data is being written or sent over network",
  "flows": "N/A; only reads package info, no untrusted data flow",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward package version retrieval, no obfuscation or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to obtain the version of a specific package using pkg_resources. It handles the case where the package is not installed by catching DistributionNotFound. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. The code does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or execute untrusted code. The structure is simple and standard for version detection, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package version check with proper exception handling, no malicious behavior detected, and no security risks identified.",
