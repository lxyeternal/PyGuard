{
  "purpose": "Retrieve the version of the 'django-user-sessions' package if installed.",
  "sources": "The get_distribution function call, which reads the installed package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external sinks; exception handling is local.",
  "flows": "Attempt to get package version; on failure, set version to None.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward use of pkg_resources without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code uses pkg_resources.get_distribution to obtain the version of a specific package, with exception handling for DistributionNotFound. It performs a simple, standard operation without processing untrusted input, performing network activity, or executing malicious code. No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. The exception handling is appropriate and does not introduce security issues. The code's purpose is benign, and the logic is clear and correct.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility snippet for version detection of a Python package. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is effectively 0, consistent with the code's behavior.",
