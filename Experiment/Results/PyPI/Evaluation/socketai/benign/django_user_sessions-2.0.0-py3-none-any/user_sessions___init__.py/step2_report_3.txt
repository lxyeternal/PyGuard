  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: attempting to retrieve the version of 'django-user-sessions' using `pkg_resources.get_distribution()`, with exception handling for `DistributionNotFound`.\n- The code is straightforward, standard, and does not involve untrusted data, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- The security risk scores are mostly 0, with one report assigning 0.1, which is marginal and likely due to a conservative default or minor concern.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** The code functions as intended for version retrieval; no issues or malicious activity are present.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No errors, flaws, or mistakes are evident in the code or the reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports correctly identify the code as non-obfuscated.\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly assign malware scores of 0.\n- **Security risk:** No significant security risks are present; the minimal 0.1 score seems to be an overly cautious default.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring Justification:\n- **Malware score (0):** No malicious activity or suspicious behavior is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score (0):** The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score (~0):** The code is a simple utility with no security concerns; the one 0.1 score is marginal and perhaps unnecessary.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned are reasonable; no changes are necessary.\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no anomalies or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Security risk score:** 0 (or 0.1 if a conservative approach is preferred)\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard, safe utility snippet with no security concerns.**",
