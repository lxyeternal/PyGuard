  "purpose": "Retrieve the version number of the 'django-user-sessions' package if installed.",
  "sources": "get_distribution('django-user-sessions').version, the import of DistributionNotFound and get_distribution",
  "sinks": "None; no data is being written out or sent over a network.",
  "flows": "Input is the package name 'django-user-sessions'; the flow is from the get_distribution call to setting the __version__ variable.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and does not contain any unusual or obfuscated constructs. It handles exceptions properly and does not contain hardcoded secrets or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions to access installed package distributions. It attempts to get the version of 'django-user-sessions', and if the package is not found, it sets __version__ to None. There are no suspicious behaviors such as network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious logic. The structure is simple and standard for version checking.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a standard way to check for a package's version and handle its absence. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks.",
