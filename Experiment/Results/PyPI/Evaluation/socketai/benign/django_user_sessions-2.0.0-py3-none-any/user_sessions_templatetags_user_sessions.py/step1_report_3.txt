{
  "purpose": "To provide utility filters for user agent parsing and IP geolocation in Django templates.",
  "sources": "The 'location' function reads an IP address input; 'geoip()' loads GeoIP2 data.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external network communication; the code only performs data processing and warnings.",
  "flows": "The 'location' function calls 'geoip()' to obtain GeoIP2 object, then accesses city or country data.",
  "anomalies": "Uses warnings.warn() to emit warnings; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code; no external data leaks or malicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines regex patterns for browser and device detection, then provides filters to parse user agent strings and resolve IP geolocation. It includes standard error handling and conditional GeoIP2 initialization. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. Usage of warnings is typical and does not pose security threats. No external network communication beyond what GeoIP2 performs internally. No signs of malware, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation. Overall, the code appears safe and intended for legitimate purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Django template utility module for user agent and IP geolocation processing. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, and the security risk is minimal.",
