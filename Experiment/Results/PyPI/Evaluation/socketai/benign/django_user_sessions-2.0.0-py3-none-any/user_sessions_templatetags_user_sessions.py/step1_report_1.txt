{
  "purpose": "Provide utilities to parse user agent strings into human-readable device and browser info, and to resolve IP addresses to geographical locations.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the user agent string for device() and browser() functions, and IP address for location() function.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include use of the geoip() function which performs IP geolocation lookups, and string formatting for output.",
  "flows": "Input data (user agent/IP address) flows into regex matching or geoip lookup, then outputs formatted strings.",
  "anomalies": "The geoip() function performs dynamic import of GeoIP2; however, there are no hardcoded credentials, suspicious network calls, or backdoors present. The use of warnings.warn() on exceptions is benign and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code aims to translate user agent strings into readable browser and device names, and IP addresses into geographic locations. It uses regex patterns for matching user agent components and performs IP geolocation via Django's GeoIP2 library, with fallback exception handling. No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The dynamic import of GeoIP2 is a typical pattern, and the warnings are benign. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network attacks, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, standard, and does not exhibit malicious intent or security risks. It performs typical user agent parsing and IP geolocation tasks without suspicious activity.",
