{
  "purpose": "The code provides Django template filters to interpret user agent strings into human-readable device and browser info, and to determine geographic location from IP addresses using GeoIP.",
  "sources": "Input data is taken from 'value' parameters in the 'device' and 'location' functions, specifically user agent strings and IP addresses.",
  "sinks": "Location function may access external geoip database; no direct data leaks or sensitive operations are evident.",
  "flows": "User agent string → device/browser matching → formatted string; IP address → geoip database → location data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. Use of warnings for exception handling is standard. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious activity detected. The code's purpose is straightforward and appears safe.",
  "analysis": "The code defines regex patterns for user agents and devices, providing filters for readable device and browser names, and attempts to resolve IP to location using Django's GeoIP. Exception handling is present but standard; no malicious behavior or data exfiltration patterns are evident. No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious network activity, no obfuscation, and no code injection points are present. Use of warnings for exceptions is standard for debugging or operational logging. Overall, the code appears to serve legitimate functions with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for interpreting user agents and IP locations within a Django project. No malicious behavior, malware, or supply chain security issues are detected. It is safe to use from a security standpoint.",
