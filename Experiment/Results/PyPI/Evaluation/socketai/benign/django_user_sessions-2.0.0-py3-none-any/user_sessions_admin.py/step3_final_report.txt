{
  "purpose": "Django admin interface for session management, including filters for session validity and ownership, and display functions for location and device info.",
  "sources": "Request parameters for filters; session model fields for display; imported external functions 'location' and 'device' for session info.",
  "sinks": "Filtering queryset based on request data; display functions returning session info; no direct data leaks or external data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Request parameters -> queryset filters; session objects -> display functions ('location', 'device') outputs.",
  "anomalies": "External functions 'location' and 'device' are imported; their implementations are unknown but assumed benign; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Django admin customization for session management, employing standard filters and display methods. External functions are used for session info display but are imported from template tags, which is typical. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The filtering logic is based on request data and current time/user, which is standard. External functions' safety cannot be guaranteed without review, but their usage here appears benign. The overall structure and logic follow best practices, with no signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Django admin module for session management. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks are evident. The low malware score (0), obfuscation score (0), and risk score (~0.1-0.2) are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
