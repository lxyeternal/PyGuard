{
  "purpose": "The code defines an admin interface for managing user sessions in a Django application, including filters and display methods.",
  "sources": "User input is indirectly read via Django admin filters and URL parameters for filtering session data.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leakage points include the display of user-related data in admin interface, but no direct data exfiltration or malicious network activity is observed.",
  "flows": "Filters (ExpiredFilter and OwnerFilter) receive URL query parameters and filter the queryset accordingly. Display functions generate session-related info for admin display.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. The imported modules and functions are standard and seem to serve legitimate purposes. The use of 'location' and 'device' functions depends on external tags but appears to be benign. No obfuscated or misleading code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides Django admin customizations for session management with filters and display functions. It uses standard Django features and external template tags. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling are detected. The filtering logic is straightforward and based on trusted data. No insecure data handling or network activity is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, benign Django admin customization for session management. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks based on the provided code.",
