{
  "purpose": "The code defines Django admin interface customizations for managing user sessions, including filters and display options.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the database models (Session, User), request object (request.user), and external template tags (device, location).",
  "sinks": "Potential data flows involve filtering querysets based on user input (request parameters) and displaying session data, but there are no direct sinks leading to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Input from request parameters (e.g., filter values) influences queryset filtering; template tags may process session data for display.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are present. The code uses standard Django practices for admin customization. The external template tags (device, location) are imported but their implementation is unknown, though their usage appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code implements custom Django admin filters and display logic for user sessions, including filtering by validity and ownership. The filters rely on current time and request user data for filtering, which is standard. The external functions 'device' and 'location' are used to enhance display but their implementations are not shown; they could potentially introduce risk if malicious, but they are assumed to be legitimate. No dynamic code execution, unsafe SQL, or data leaks are evident. There are no indications of obfuscated or malicious code snippets. The code is straightforward, using typical Django patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, safe implementation of Django admin customization for session management, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code.",
