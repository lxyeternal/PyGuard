{
  "purpose": "The code defines Django admin interface customizations for managing user sessions, including filters and display options.",
  "sources": "Input sources include request parameters in lookups and querysets, request.user, and session data.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include filtering querysets based on request data, accessing user data, and rendering session information.",
  "flows": "Request parameters ('active', 'owner') influence queryset filtering for session validity and ownership; user data is used to filter sessions and retrieve user info for display.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of external functions 'device' and 'location' relies on imported templatetags, which could be scrutinized but are standard Django practices.",
  "analysis": "The code provides admin filters for session validity and ownership, dynamically filters querysets based on request parameters, and displays session info including device and location info obtained from external functions. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident; the code follows typical Django patterns and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django admin customization with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It manages session display and filtering securely, with no hardcoded secrets or malicious flows.",
