  "purpose": "Define URL patterns for session management in a Django application, including listing sessions and deleting specific or other sessions.",
  "sources": "URL pattern definitions, including route strings and view imports",
  "sinks": "Routing requests to views; no untrusted data handling within this code fragment",
  "flows": "URL requests match patterns and invoke corresponding views; no data flow from untrusted sources is evident in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard Django URL configuration",
  "analysis": "The code imports URL functions and views, then defines URL patterns for session listing and deletion. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. The views are imported but their internal logic isn't shown, limiting deeper security analysis, but the URL routing itself is safe. All reports correctly identify the code as standard, with malware scores of 0 and low security risk scores. The pattern with a primary key parameter is typical and not inherently risky. No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure Django URL configuration for session management. The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
