  "purpose": "Define URL routing patterns for user session management in a Django application.",
  "sources": "The code reads route definitions and imports views related to session management.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform dangerous operations are present.",
  "flows": "URL patterns route incoming requests to specific view classes; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns detected. The code structure appears standard for Django URL routing.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary Django URL functions and views related to session management. It defines three URL patterns: one for listing sessions, one for deleting other sessions, and one for deleting a specific session identified by a primary key. The use of path and re_path is typical. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious code constructs are present. All components align with standard practices, and no malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard URL configuration for session management in a Django app, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
