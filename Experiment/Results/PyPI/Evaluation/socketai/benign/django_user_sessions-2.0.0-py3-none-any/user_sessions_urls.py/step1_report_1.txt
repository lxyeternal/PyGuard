{
  "purpose": "Defines URL patterns for user session management in a Django application.",
  "sources": "Imports from django.urls and views from user_sessions and local modules, which provide data about sessions.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; URL patterns route user requests to views, but do not process untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "URL patterns map incoming request paths to specific class-based views for session listing and deletion.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures detected. No use of dynamic execution or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up URL routes for session management, using Django's path and re_path functions to connect URLs to class-based views. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The views themselves are not shown, so potential vulnerabilities there cannot be assessed, but the URL configuration appears standard and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Django URL configuration for session management without any apparent malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain obfuscation or suspicious behavior. Overall, it appears safe.",
