  "purpose": "Define URL patterns for user session management views in a Django application",
  "sources": "Imports from django.urls and views from user_sessions and current module",
  "sinks": "None present; the code only defines URL routes and views without handling untrusted data",
  "flows": "No data flow from external input to sensitive operations; URL patterns are static and defined at compile time",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; the URL patterns are standard",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary Django URL functions and specific views for session management. It then defines a URL namespace 'user_sessions' with three URL patterns: two using 'path' and one using 're_path'. These patterns map URLs to class-based views responsible for listing sessions, deleting other sessions, and deleting a specific session by primary key. The URL regex captures a 'pk' parameter, but it is a straightforward pattern without dynamic code execution or untrusted input handling. There are no signs of malicious code, secret leaks, or obfuscation. The code serves a typical routing purpose, with no suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard URL configuration for session management in a Django app, with no evidence of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It is a typical, safe implementation for routing views.",
