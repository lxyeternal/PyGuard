  "purpose": "Define URL patterns for user session management views in a Django web application.",
  "sources": "Imports from django.urls and views from user_sessions.views and local views module; URL pattern definitions.",
  "sinks": "Django URL routing system that directs requests to specific view classes based on URL patterns.",
  "flows": "HTTP requests to specific URLs match patterns and invoke corresponding view methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard Django URL configuration. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary URL handling functions and view classes, then defines URL patterns for listing sessions, deleting other sessions, and deleting specific sessions by primary key. All patterns follow standard Django conventions, with no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, or suspicious logic. The views are imported but their internal implementations are not shown, which limits deeper security analysis. The URL regex patterns are straightforward and typical for such functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Django URL configuration for session management, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to serve its intended purpose without introducing vulnerabilities.",
