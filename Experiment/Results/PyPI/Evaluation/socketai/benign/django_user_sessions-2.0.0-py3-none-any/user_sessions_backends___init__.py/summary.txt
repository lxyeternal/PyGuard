  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low malware and obfuscation scores. Report 4's patterns suggest moderate suspicion, justifying slightly elevated scores. Overall, the supply chain risk remains low, with careful monitoring recommended for code exhibiting dynamic execution or unvalidated data handling."
