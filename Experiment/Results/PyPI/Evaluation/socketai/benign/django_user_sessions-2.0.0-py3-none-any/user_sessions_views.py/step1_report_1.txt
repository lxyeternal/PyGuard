  "purpose": "Manage user sessions by listing, deleting individual sessions, and deleting all other sessions for authenticated users.",
  "sources": "Request data such as session keys and user info; settings for redirection URLs.",
  "sinks": "Redirects and logout actions that terminate user sessions; potential flow of session deletion.",
  "flows": "User request -> session verification -> session deletion or listing -> redirect/logout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual code structures; standard Django session management.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily utilizes Django's built-in authentication, session, and view mechanisms. It enforces login requirements, manages session queries, and allows users to delete their own sessions or all sessions except the current one. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. The flow of data appears to be standard for session management, with appropriate use of Django utilities. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns detected. The code's purpose aligns with session control, and it does not include any external network communications or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard Django session management for user sessions, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It correctly handles user session listing and deletion without exposing sensitive information or executing harmful actions.",
