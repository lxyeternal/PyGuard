Session filtering uses timezone-aware queries, and session deletion correctly logs out users. URL resolutions and redirections are straightforward. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. All actions conform to expected session management patterns, with no suspicious data leaks or network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate session management views with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It adheres to Django best practices and does not contain malware or security flaws.",
