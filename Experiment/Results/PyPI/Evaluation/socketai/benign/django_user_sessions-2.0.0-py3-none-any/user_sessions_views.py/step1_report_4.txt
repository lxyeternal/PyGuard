  "purpose": "This code provides views for managing user sessions in a Django web application, including listing and deleting sessions.",
  "sources": "The code reads session information from Django's session model via request.session and request.user.session_set.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include redirecting users after session deletion and calling logout(), which could be misused if manipulated, but are standard practices.",
  "flows": "Input from request.session and request.user.session_set flows through methods like delete() and get_queryset(), resulting in session deletions or redirections.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are detected. Usage of Django standard features appears normal.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes standard Django views and mixins for session management. It authenticates users with login_required, safely deletes sessions, and logs out users appropriately. No malicious code or suspicious data handling is present. No suspicious external calls, data leaks, or obfuscated code are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard session management implementation with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It adheres to common security practices in Django. No malware or security issues are identified.",
