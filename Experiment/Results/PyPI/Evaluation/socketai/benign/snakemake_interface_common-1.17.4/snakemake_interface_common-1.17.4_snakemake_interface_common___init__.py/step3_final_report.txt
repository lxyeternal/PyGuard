  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code reading input data, environment variables, network connections, file operations, and potential obfuscation indicators.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows leading to network transmission, file modification, or environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or environment variables potentially flow into network or file operations; obfuscation may mask these flows.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation scores, minimal or suspicious code formatting, inconsistent code structure, potential concealment of malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets are either benign, missing, or minimal. Reports 1, 2, and 3 correctly identify no malicious activity, assigning zero malware and obfuscation scores, with low security risk. Report 4 shows limited data with low suspicion, justified by low confidence and risk scores. Report 5 indicates high obfuscation (0.8) and suspicion but no concrete malicious functions, leading to a low malware score (0.2), moderate security risk (0.3), and moderate confidence (0.4). The high obfuscation score aligns with suspicion, but without evidence of malicious activity, the malware score remains low. Slightly increasing the malware score in Report 5 to 0.3 could better reflect the suspicion associated with obfuscation. Overall, the scores are consistent with the descriptions, with minor adjustments recommended for Report 5.",
  "conclusion": "Most code snippets are benign or absent, with no evidence of malicious activity. Suspicious obfuscation in one report warrants cautious scoring but does not confirm malicious intent. The overall security risk remains low. Slightly increasing the malware score for obfuscated code could improve accuracy, but current scores are reasonable.",
