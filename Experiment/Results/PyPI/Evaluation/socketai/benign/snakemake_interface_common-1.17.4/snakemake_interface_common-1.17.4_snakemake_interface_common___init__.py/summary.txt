  "conclusion": "Most code snippets are benign or absent, with no evidence of malicious activity. Suspicious obfuscation in one report warrants cautious scoring but does not confirm malicious intent. The overall security risk remains low. Slightly increasing the malware score for obfuscated code could improve accuracy, but current scores are reasonable."
