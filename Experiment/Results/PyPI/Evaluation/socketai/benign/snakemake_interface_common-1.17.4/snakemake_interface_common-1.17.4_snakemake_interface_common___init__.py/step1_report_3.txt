  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or functionality, but without seeing the actual code content, it's unclear what specific operations are intended.",
  "sources": "Potential data input sources may include environment variables, user input functions, file reads, or network requests, but the specific locations cannot be identified without code details.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could be data writes, network transmissions, system modifications, or external calls, but no explicit sinks can be identified without the code content.",
  "flows": "Without the actual code, it is not possible to trace source-to-sink data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be identified due to the absence of code details. The code appears to be empty or missing.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is empty or not included, so no analysis of suspicious or malicious behavior can be performed. No sources, sinks, or flows are observable, and there are no unusual patterns or hardcoded secrets evident.",
  "conclusion": "There is insufficient code content provided to perform a meaningful security review. No malicious behavior or security risks can be assessed without the actual code.",
