  "purpose": "Utility class for managing enum choices, parsing, and filtering, facilitating conversion between enum members and string choices.",
  "sources": "Enum member definitions and string manipulations within class methods",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, network, or file I/O involved",
  "flows": "Enum members are converted to choice strings via item_to_choice; input strings are parsed back to enum members through parse_choice, with filtering via skip_for_all",
  "anomalies": "Type annotation in _parse_choices_into incorrectly specifies 'choices' as str instead of an iterable; no malicious anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code provides a straightforward enum utility with methods for listing, parsing, and formatting choices. The only technical anomaly is a type annotation mismatch in _parse_choices_into, which is a bug but not malicious. No suspicious or malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation are present. The code performs safe string operations and enum lookups. The abstract method skip_for_all is meant to be overridden, and its default implementation is benign. The overall security risk is minimal, with scores aligning with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard enum utility class with a minor bug in type annotation. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is present. The security risk is very low, and the malware score is zero. The minor bug should be corrected for clarity, but it does not impact security.",
