{
  "purpose": "Defines attribute types with associated modes and kinds, facilitating type annotations and behavior in a larger application.",
  "sources": "Imports from dataclasses, enum, and typing modules; class and method definitions reading no external input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources; no external output or data transmission present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code solely defines data structures and properties.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs detected. The code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two enum classes (AttributeMode, AttributeKind) and a dataclass (AttributeType) with properties and methods to manage attribute metadata. It uses standard Python features with no external data inputs, outputs, or operations that could be malicious. No dynamic execution, network calls, or credential handling are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical data structure definition with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It appears safe and standard for use in larger codebases.",
