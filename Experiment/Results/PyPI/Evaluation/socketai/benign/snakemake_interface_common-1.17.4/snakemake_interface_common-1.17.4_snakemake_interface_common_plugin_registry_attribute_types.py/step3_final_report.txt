  "purpose": "Defines metadata structures for attribute management using enums and dataclass.",
  "sources": "No external input; static class and enum definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow to untrusted sources or external systems.",
  "flows": "N/A; static definitions without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, well-structured code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of enum and dataclass definitions for attribute metadata, with no dynamic behavior, external data handling, or malicious constructs. It is static, readable, and uses standard Python features. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious intent are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The reasoning across reports is accurate and aligns with the code's purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static data structure definition with no security risks or malicious behavior. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
