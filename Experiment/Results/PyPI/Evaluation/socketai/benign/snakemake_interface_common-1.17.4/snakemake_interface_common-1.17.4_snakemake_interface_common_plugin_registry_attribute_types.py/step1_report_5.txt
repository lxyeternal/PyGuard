  "purpose": "Define data structures for attribute metadata including modes and kinds, using enums and dataclasses.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules; class and method definitions; property and method implementations.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data is read from or written to external sources.",
  "flows": "No external data flows are present; code only defines types and methods.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two enums, AttributeMode and AttributeKind, for categorizing attribute properties. It then defines a dataclass AttributeType with fields for class type, mode, and kind, with default values. Methods include property checks for optionality and class type, and a method to convert an attribute to required mode. The code is straightforward, with no dynamic execution, network calls, or other suspicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation of metadata classes for attributes, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is a benign component likely used for type or attribute management within a larger system.",
