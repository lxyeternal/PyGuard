{
  "purpose": "Define enumerations and a data class for attribute metadata with configurable properties",
  "sources": "None explicitly reading untrusted input; only class definitions and property methods",
  "sinks": "None; no data output, network access, or system calls present",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; purely static class and property definitions",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; straightforward class and enum definitions, no hardcoded secrets or dynamic execution",
  "analysis": "The code consists of enum definitions and a data class with properties and a method to convert attribute modes. It appears to serve as a type/model descriptor for other code. There are no input or output operations, no network access, and no evidence of malicious behavior. The code structure is standard and adheres to common Python practices. No anomalies, obfuscated code, or malicious intents are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static class and enum definitions used for attribute metadata configuration. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
