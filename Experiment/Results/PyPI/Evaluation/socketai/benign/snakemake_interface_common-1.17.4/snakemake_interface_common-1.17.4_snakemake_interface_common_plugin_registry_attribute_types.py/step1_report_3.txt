  "purpose": "Define data structures and enums for attribute types, modes, and kinds used in a larger application or framework.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library modules: dataclasses, enum, typing. Class definitions with properties and methods.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data flows to untrusted sources; code mostly defines types and simple methods.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; code defines static classes and properties with no runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward and purely structural.",
  "analysis": "The code creates enumerations for attribute modes and kinds, and a dataclass 'AttributeType' with properties and methods to manage attribute metadata. All parts use standard Python features and serve as data structures. No dynamic execution, no external data handling, and no suspicious or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign implementation of data structures for attribute metadata management. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks.",
