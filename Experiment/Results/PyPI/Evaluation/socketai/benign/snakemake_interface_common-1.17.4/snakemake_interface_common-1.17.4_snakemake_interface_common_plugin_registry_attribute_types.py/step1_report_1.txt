  "purpose": "Define enumerations and a data class for attribute metadata management, including attribute modes and kinds.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes and methods, no input or external data is read.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, I/O, or external data manipulation occurs.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; there are no data flows from sources to sinks in this static code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears standard and straightforward. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two Enums for attribute modes and kinds, and a dataclass for attribute type metadata. The class includes properties to check modes and kinds, and a method to convert an attribute to a required mode. There are no inputs, outputs, external calls, or dynamic behaviors. All constructs are typical for type and metadata management in Python.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard, well-structured, and appears benign. It is unlikely to contain malicious behavior or security risks. There are no signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious intent.",
