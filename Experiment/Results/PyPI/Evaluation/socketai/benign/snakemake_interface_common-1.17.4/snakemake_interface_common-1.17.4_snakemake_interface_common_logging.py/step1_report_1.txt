{
  "purpose": "Define a function to retrieve a logger singleton from the snakemake logging module.",
  "sources": "The import statement within the get_logger() function: 'from snakemake.logging import logger'.",
  "sinks": "The return statement returning the logger object; potential use of logger for logging purposes.",
  "flows": "Input source: import statement -> Output: returning the logger object.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; the import is local to the function, which is acceptable. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines metadata variables about the author and license, which are benign. The get_logger() function imports a logger object from the snakemake.logging module at runtime and returns it. This is a standard pattern for lazy importing and singleton access. There are no dynamic code executions, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. The import is local to the function, reducing the risk of side effects at module load. Overall, the code appears straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard utility function to retrieve a logger from the snakemake package. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It is a benign code snippet, serving a logging purpose with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
