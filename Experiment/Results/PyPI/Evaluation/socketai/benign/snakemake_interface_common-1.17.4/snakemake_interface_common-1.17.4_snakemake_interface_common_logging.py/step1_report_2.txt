  "purpose": "Define a function to retrieve the singleton logger instance from the snakemake logging module.",
  "sources": "Import statement within get_logger() that imports logger from snakemake.logging.",
  "sinks": "Return statement that provides access to the logger instance; potential to invoke logger methods elsewhere.",
  "flows": "get_logger() imports logger from snakemake.logging and returns it, allowing further use of logger methods.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code constructs; straightforward import and return pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code defines metadata attributes and a simple function that imports and returns a logger object from an external module. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. The import inside the function is a common pattern to avoid import-time side effects and is not inherently malicious. The code's simplicity and clarity suggest normal behavior without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves a basic utility purpose to retrieve a logger instance and contains no suspicious or malicious behavior. It appears legitimate and safe.",
