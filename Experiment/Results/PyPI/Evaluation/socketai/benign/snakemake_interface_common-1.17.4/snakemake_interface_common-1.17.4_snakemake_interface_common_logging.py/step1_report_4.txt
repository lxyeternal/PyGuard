{
  "purpose": "Define a function to retrieve a singleton logger instance from the snakemake.logging module.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only imports a module internally within the function.",
  "sinks": "The logger object returned could potentially be used elsewhere, but no malicious activity is evident here.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is evident in this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code only includes metadata variables and a simple function that imports and returns a logger object from snakemake.logging. The import is local within the function, minimizing side effects. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward utility function for retrieving a logger, with no malicious intent or security concerns identified.",
