{
  "purpose": "Define a function to retrieve the singleton logger from the snakemake.logging module.",
  "sources": "The function imports the logger object from snakemake.logging when called.",
  "sinks": "The logger object could potentially be used to log untrusted data, but no direct data sinks are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "The function imports the logger module and returns it; there are no data flows involving untrusted input or output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. The code imports a known logging module without any obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines metadata variables and a function to retrieve a logger object from snakemake.logging. The import is deferred until the function call, which is normal. No untrusted input, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. The code is straightforward and follows standard practices for logging.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility function for retrieving a logger instance, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
