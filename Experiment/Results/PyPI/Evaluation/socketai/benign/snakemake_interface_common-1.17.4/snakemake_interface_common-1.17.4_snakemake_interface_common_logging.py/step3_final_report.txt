  "purpose": "Retrieve the singleton logger object from the snakemake.logging module for logging purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement within get_logger() function: 'from snakemake.logging import logger'.",
  "sinks": "Return of the logger object; no untrusted data flows or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Function call to get_logger() leads to import of logger, then returning the logger object; no external data or untrusted input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution detected. The import is local, standard, and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code defines metadata variables and a function get_logger() that imports and returns a logger object from snakemake.logging. The import is local within the function, a common pattern to delay import or prevent side effects. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with high confidence. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code serves a utility purpose and does not perform any malicious actions or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function for retrieving a logger object from snakemake.logging. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain at zero across all categories.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
