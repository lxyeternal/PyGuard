  "purpose": "To retrieve and return the singleton logger instance from the snakemake.logging module.",
  "sources": "The import statement within the get_logger() function that imports 'logger' from snakemake.logging.",
  "sinks": "Return statement that outputs the logger object; no untrusted data flow present.",
  "flows": "Import from snakemake.logging -> return logger; no data from untrusted sources flows into sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines metadata attributes and a simple function that imports a logger object from an external module. The import is local within the function, which minimizes side effects. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears standard for a utility module, with no signs of data exfiltration or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and serves a logging purpose. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
