  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for rules with properties 'name', 'lineno', and 'snakefile'.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources; class properties are defined but not populated.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; no untrusted data handling or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths; code only defines an abstract interface.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes an abstract interface with three properties, using standard Python features. No external data inputs, no data processing, and no side effects are present. The code appears to be a typical interface definition without malicious or suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward definition of an abstract base class with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
