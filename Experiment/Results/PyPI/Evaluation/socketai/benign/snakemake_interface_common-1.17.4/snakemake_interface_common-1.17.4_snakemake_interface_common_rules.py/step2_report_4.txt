  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code imports `ABC` and `abstractmethod` from `abc`, and `Path` from `pathlib`.\n- It defines an abstract class `RuleInterface` with three abstract properties: `name` (str), `lineno` (int), and `snakefile` (Path).\n\n**Security and Malware Analysis:**\n- The code is a straightforward interface definition, with no runtime data handling, no external data sources, no data sinks, and no system interactions.\n- There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.\n- The code does not perform any I/O, network activity, or execute any dynamic code.\n- The purpose appears to be structural, serving as a contract for subclasses.\n\n**Review of Reports:**\n- All reports concur that the code is a standard Python interface with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- The confidence levels are high (1.0 or 1), and all reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or security concerns are identified.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports. This is appropriate; the code is purely structural.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0, as the code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0, since there's no potential for security risk in a static interface definition.\n\n**Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n- No discrepancies are apparent.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- The code is a simple, safe, and standard abstract class interface.\n- There are no security risks, malware, or obfuscation concerns.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the consensus and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard Python abstract class defining an interface with no security issues or malicious behavior. The reports are accurate and consistent. No changes to scores are necessary.",
