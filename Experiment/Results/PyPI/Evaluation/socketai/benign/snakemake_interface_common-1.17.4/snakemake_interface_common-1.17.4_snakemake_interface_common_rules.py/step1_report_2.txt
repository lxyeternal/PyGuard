  "purpose": "Defines an abstract base class interface for rules, specifying properties for name, line number, and associated file.",
  "sources": "Import statements: 'abc' for abstract base classes, 'Path' from 'pathlib' for filesystem paths.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input or output operations.",
  "anomalies": "Uses standard Python features for defining abstract classes; no unusual code, obfuscation, or hidden behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code declares an abstract class with three abstract properties, serving as an interface. There are no input/output operations, no data manipulation, and no external data sources or sinks. The code is straightforward and appears to serve as a structural component within a larger system. No signs of malicious or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple abstract class definition with no malicious intent or security risks. It functions as an interface for rule objects, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security concerns.",
