{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class interface for rules with properties: name, lineno, and snakefile.",
  "sources": "None; the code only declares an interface and imports, does not read external data.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, storage, or output functions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink as no runtime data handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and adheres to standard Python conventions; no unusual or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports ABC and Path, then defines an abstract class 'RuleInterface' with three abstract properties: name (str), lineno (int), and snakefile (Path). It is a typical interface pattern, with no external data input, output, or side effects. No suspicious behavior, malware indicators, or security risks are apparent in this static snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python interface definition with no malicious or suspicious elements. It does not perform any data processing or system interactions that could pose security concerns.",
