  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class interface for rules with properties for name, line number, and associated file path.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines an abstract class with property methods.",
  "sinks": "No data processing or handling of untrusted data; no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows present; no source-to-sink paths.",
  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual constructs. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports ABC and abstractmethod to define an abstract base class, RuleInterface, with three property methods: name, lineno, and snakefile. These are abstract properties, meaning subclasses must implement them. The code appears to be part of a larger framework, likely for rule definitions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. No obfuscation or malicious code structures are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply defines an interface for rule objects without any malicious intent or security issues. It appears safe and standard for defining abstract classes in Python.",
