{
  "purpose": "Defines an abstract base class interface for rules with properties 'name', 'lineno', and 'snakefile'.",
  "sources": "Imports 'ABC' and 'abstractmethod' from 'abc', and 'Path' from 'pathlib'. No data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines an interface with abstract properties.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up an abstract class 'RuleInterface' with three properties that subclasses are expected to implement. It imports standard Python modules without any dynamic code execution or external data handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data leakage. The code appears to serve as a structural component for larger applications.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward abstract interface definition with no malicious or security-risk behaviors. It is safe and intended for structural purposes within a larger codebase.",
