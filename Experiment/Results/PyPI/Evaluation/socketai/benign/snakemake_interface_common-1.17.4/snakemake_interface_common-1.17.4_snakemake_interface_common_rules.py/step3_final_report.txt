  "purpose": "Define an abstract interface with properties 'name', 'lineno', and 'snakefile' for subclasses to implement.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "None; there are no data flows from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward abstract class with standard Python syntax.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, defines an abstract class with three abstract properties, and contains no runtime logic, external data handling, or suspicious constructs. All reports confirm its benign, static nature. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's static, structural purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python interface definition with no security concerns or malicious elements. The reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications to the scores are necessary.",
