{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for error handling in a Snakemake workflow environment, including detailed error formatting.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are primarily class parameters such as 'rule', 'lineno', 'snakefile', and exception arguments passed during error instantiation.",
  "sinks": "Error message construction and formatting functions that could potentially display untrusted input if error details are derived from untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Exception arguments (args) are formatted and joined into error messages, which are then raised as exception instances. No external data flows into sensitive sinks unless passed as error message arguments.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code uses standard exception handling and formatting logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines exception classes with custom formatting for error messages, incorporating optional source location info (rule, lineno, snakefile). The '_get_spec' method constructs descriptions based on class attributes, and 'format_arg' recursively formats nested exceptions or strings. The 'InvalidPluginException' class extends 'ApiError' with a formatted message involving plugin name and error message. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated constructs, or suspicious behaviors are present. The data flow is straightforward, primarily handling error message formatting without external inputs influencing untrusted sinks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of custom error classes for a workflow management system. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious code. It appears to be a legitimate part of a larger system's error handling framework.",
