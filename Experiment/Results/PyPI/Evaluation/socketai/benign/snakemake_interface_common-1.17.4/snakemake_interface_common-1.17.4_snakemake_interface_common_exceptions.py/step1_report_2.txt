  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for error handling in a Snakemake workflow, including detailed formatting for error messages.",
  "sources": "Reads data from exception instances and optional rule objects, including their attributes like rule name, line number, and file path.",
  "sinks": "Formats error messages and exception details for display or logging, using string concatenation and formatting.",
  "flows": "Exception instances and their attributes serve as sources, with formatted error messages as sinks; data flows from exception data to string output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily establishes custom exception classes with detailed formatting logic for error reporting. It accesses attributes of exceptions and rule objects to construct human-readable messages. There are no inputs from external untrusted sources, no file or network operations, and no dynamic code execution. The logic appears straightforward and standard for error handling. No signs of malicious intent or sabotage detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements structured exception handling and message formatting for a Snakemake workflow environment. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It is a benign error handling module with no security risks.",
