{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for a workflow management system, with detailed formatting and error reporting features.",
  "sources": "Reads metadata about the rule, snakefile, and exception arguments for error reporting.",
  "sinks": "Uses exception message construction, string formatting, and class attributes; no data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Input data (error arguments, rule info) flow into exception message formatting, but no external data or network operations occur.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Exception handling and message formatting are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exceptions with detailed formatting and context reporting for workflow errors. It uses class attributes, sys.version_info for version-specific behavior, and string manipulation. No untrusted data sources or dangerous sinks are present. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected; code appears to be standard error handling logic for a workflow system.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of custom exception classes for error reporting, with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
