{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for error handling in a Snakemake environment, with detailed message formatting including optional context such as rule, line number, and snakefile.",
  "sources": "Exception arguments, rule attributes, system info used in error message construction.",
  "sinks": "Formatted error messages displayed or logged, potentially including untrusted data if exception args are externally derived.",
  "flows": "Exception args and rule attributes flow into formatted strings via format_arg and __init__, ultimately producing error messages.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward exception handling without obfuscation or external resource access.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes with detailed formatting. It does not perform dynamic code execution, network activity, or handle external data beyond exception arguments. The formatting functions could include untrusted data if exception args originate from untrusted sources, but this is typical in error handling. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The exception classes serve purely for error reporting, with no security vulnerabilities detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured error handling for a Snakemake environment, with no malicious intent or security risks. The minimal potential for information leakage via error messages is a common concern but not specific to malicious activity. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting the standard nature of error message formatting.",
