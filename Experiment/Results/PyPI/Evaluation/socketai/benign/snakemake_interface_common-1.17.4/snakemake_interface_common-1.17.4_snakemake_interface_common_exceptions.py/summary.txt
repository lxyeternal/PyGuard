  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured error handling for a Snakemake environment, with no malicious intent or security risks. The minimal potential for information leakage via error messages is a common concern but not specific to malicious activity. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting the standard nature of error message formatting."
