{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling API and workflow errors within a Snakemake-related environment, including detailed error formatting.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include exception arguments, rule attributes, and system version info.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or external resource access.",
  "flows": "Input exceptions and their arguments are processed and formatted for display; no external data flow or untrusted data handling detected.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of exception class definitions with custom formatting methods, primarily for error reporting in a workflow management context. It accesses attributes of exception objects, system info, and rule objects. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or external data handling are present. The code appears to be straightforward, intended solely for error message formatting and exception hierarchy.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as custom exception handling classes with enhanced formatting. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident.",
