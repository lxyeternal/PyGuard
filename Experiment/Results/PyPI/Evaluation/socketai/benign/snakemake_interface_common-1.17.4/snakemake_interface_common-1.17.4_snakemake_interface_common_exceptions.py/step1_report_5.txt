{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for error handling in a Snakemake workflow, including detailed formatting of error messages.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are the arguments passed to exception classes, rule attributes, and system information like sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "Error message formatting and exception raising, which could potentially display untrusted input if misused, but no direct data leakage or external calls are present.",
  "flows": "Error information flows from exception instantiation to message formatting and finally to exception raising, without external data sinks or network calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code. The code appears to be straightforward error handling classes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes with detailed message formatting, leveraging system info and rule attributes. No input from external sources is processed beyond exception parameters. No external network, file, or system modifications are observed. It relies on standard Python features and exception handling patterns. The class uses internal attributes and formatting methods to construct error messages, with optional rule context. No suspicious or malicious code, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors, is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom error classes for a workflow system, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured, with no external data or network interactions, and focuses solely on error message handling.",
