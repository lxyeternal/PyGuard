  "purpose": "This code implements a singleton plugin registry that dynamically discovers and loads plugins based on a naming convention, validating their attributes and types.",
  "sources": "pkgutil.iter_modules() for module discovery; importlib.import_module() for dynamic loading; attribute access for validation.",
  "sinks": "None directly; potential risk if malicious modules are introduced into the environment, as they could be loaded dynamically.",
  "flows": "Module discovery via pkgutil; filtering by prefix; import via importlib; validation of attributes; registration in self.plugins.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code; straightforward validation; no obfuscation; no external data leaks or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard plugin management pattern using dynamic discovery and import, with attribute validation to ensure plugin integrity. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The primary security concern is the potential for malicious modules to be loaded if environment trust is compromised, but the code filters modules by prefix to mitigate this risk. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate given the context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, well-structured plugin registry with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The main risk stems from environment trustworthiness, not the code itself. The current scores are justified and should be maintained.",
