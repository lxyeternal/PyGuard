  "conclusion": "The code is a set of legitimate filesystem utilities with platform-specific safeguards. The primary security risk is potential command injection via untrusted file paths in subprocess calls. No malware or malicious intent is detected. To mitigate risks, input sanitization should be implemented before passing file paths to system commands."
