  "purpose": "Configuration script for building Sphinx documentation, handling environment detection, URL resolution for source code links, and notebook preprocessing.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, module inspection, file paths, regex patterns for URL rewriting.",
  "sinks": "URL generation for source code links, modification of notebook source content.",
  "flows": "Source code inspection and environment variables feed into URL resolution and notebook preprocessing functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, standard practices used.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard documentation build configuration script utilizing environment detection, source code inspection, and URL resolution. It modifies internal scikit-learn classes solely for documentation fixes. No untrusted input is executed or transmitted, and no network activity or data leaks are present. The functions are well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads. The patching of scikit-learn internals is benign and documented. Overall, the code is safe, transparent, and typical for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured configuration script for Sphinx documentation with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals indicate a safe and standard setup.",
