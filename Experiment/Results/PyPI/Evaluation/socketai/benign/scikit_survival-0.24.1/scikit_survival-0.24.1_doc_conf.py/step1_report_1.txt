  "purpose": "Configuration and setup for building scikit-survival documentation using Sphinx, including custom preprocessors and link resolvers.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (READTHEDOCS), imported modules (e.g., os, sys, re, inspect), file paths (sksurv.__file__), source code files (via inspect), and notebook content.",
  "sinks": "Generated URLs for source code links, URLs for online documentation, or URL replacements in notebook content.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> sys.path modifications; source code inspection -> URL generation; notebook preprocessing -> URL rewriting.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; URL preprocessing is standard for documentation generation. Patch functions modify sklearn internals but do not perform malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a configuration script for Sphinx documentation, with added functionalities for URL resolution, notebook preprocessing, and module patching. It handles environment-specific settings (like RTD detection), dynamically constructs source code URLs for linking, and modifies scikit-learn internals to avoid documentation issues. All actions appear consistent with documentation build processes. No obfuscated code, malware, or malicious behaviors are evident. The URL processing ensures proper source linking, and the notebook preprocessor adjusts links without data exfiltration or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a configuration and utility script for building documentation, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. All modifications and URL handling are typical for documentation generation workflows.",
