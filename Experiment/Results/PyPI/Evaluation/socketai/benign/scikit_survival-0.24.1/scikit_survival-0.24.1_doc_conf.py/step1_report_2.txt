{
  "purpose": "The code is a configuration script for building documentation for the scikit-survival Python package using Sphinx.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (READTHEDOCS), file system paths, and imported modules such as sksurv, sys, os, re, and inspect.",
  "sinks": "Potential sources include source code files for linking and source code inspection; however, no untrusted input is processed in a way that leads to data leaks or code execution.",
  "flows": "The code accesses environment variables to determine build environment, inspects source code for documentation linking, and preprocesses notebooks for documentation. No untrusted data flows into executable or vulnerable code paths.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The only dynamic parts relate to documentation linking and environment detection, which are standard in documentation scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily manages documentation build settings, including environment detection, path management, and URL resolution for source code linking. It modifies Sphinx extension configurations and notebook preprocessing for documentation purposes. There are no indications of malicious intent, code injection, or data theft. The only dynamic behavior involves environment variable checks and source code introspection, which are safe in this context. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard documentation build configuration for the scikit-survival project, with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It performs environment detection, path management, and source code linking for documentation without executing untrusted code or handling untrusted input in a harmful manner.",
