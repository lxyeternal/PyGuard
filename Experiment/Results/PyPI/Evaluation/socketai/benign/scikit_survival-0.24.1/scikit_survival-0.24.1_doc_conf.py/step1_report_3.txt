  "purpose": "Configuration and setup script for building documentation of the scikit-survival project using Sphinx.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (READTHEDOCS), imports from standard libraries and third-party packages (nbconvert, nbsphinx, sksurv), source files (notebooks, rst files).",
  "sinks": "None detected; no code writes or transmits untrusted data, no external network connections are initiated or data exfiltrated.",
  "flows": "No malicious or suspicious data flow paths identified; the code mainly performs configuration, source code introspection, and URL manipulation for documentation purposes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual dynamic code execution, or suspicious code constructs detected. The only potentially notable aspect is the URL rewriting in notebooks, which is standard for documentation pipelines.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily configuration and utility functions for documentation generation, including environment detection, path setup, URL resolution, and custom preprocessors for notebooks. No code segments indicate data leakage, malicious network activity, or backdoors. The functions related to source code inspection and URL resolution are standard for documentation link management. The patching of scikit-learn internals is benign and intended to fix documentation issues. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard documentation build configuration with no signs of malicious intent or malicious code behavior. It mainly manipulates documentation paths, URLs, and Sphinx settings for project documentation generation. No malware or security risks are present.",
