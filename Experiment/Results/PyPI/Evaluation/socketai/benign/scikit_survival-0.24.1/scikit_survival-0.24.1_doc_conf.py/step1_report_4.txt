{
  "purpose": "This code is a configuration script for building the documentation of the 'scikit-survival' Python package using Sphinx and related tools.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables ('READTHEDOCS'), system paths, and module metadata; it also accesses source files and notebook content for processing.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are evident where untrusted data is used to execute commands, send data over the network, or access sensitive information.",
  "flows": "Data flows include environment variables influencing configuration, module source code for source link resolution, and notebook content for preprocessing, but none involve untrusted user input affecting security or system behavior.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated sections. The code primarily performs configuration and URL generation for documentation, with no signs of malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily manages documentation build configurations, including path setup, extension configurations, source code linking, and notebook URL rewriting. It safely accesses environment variables, module attributes, and source files without executing untrusted code or external commands. The URL resolution function carefully constructs links to source code lines on GitHub, which is standard practice. The notebook preprocessor modifies URLs in markdown cells to relative links, which is a benign operation. There are no indicators of data exfiltration, remote control, backdoors, or malicious code injections.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate configuration script for Sphinx documentation. It performs no malicious actions or security risks. It is standard in scope and implementation, with no malicious intent detected.",
