{
  "purpose": "The code provides a mixin class for survival analysis models, offering methods to predict survival and hazard functions, and to evaluate model performance using the concordance index.",
  "sources": "No external input sources are directly read; data is passed via function arguments such as prediction arrays, feature matrices, and structured arrays.",
  "sinks": "No suspicious sinks are present; data is processed internally and returned as arrays or functions without external communication or side effects.",
  "flows": "The data flows from input parameters (prediction arrays, feature matrices, structured arrays) through internal methods to output results such as survival functions, hazard functions, or the concordance index.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The code uses standard libraries and methods, with clear, documented functions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of survival analysis utilities using numpy and scikit-survival. It defines methods for predicting survival and hazard functions, and calculating the concordance index, with no external data or network communication. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are observed. The structure and logic are typical for such statistical modeling code. The code does not perform any unsafe operations, code injection, or data leaks. It appears to be a legitimate, purpose-driven library class with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard survival analysis mixin with no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks detected. It is safe for use in production systems.",
