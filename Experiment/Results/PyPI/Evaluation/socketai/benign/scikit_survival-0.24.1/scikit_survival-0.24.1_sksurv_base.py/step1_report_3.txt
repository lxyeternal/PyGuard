{
  "purpose": "The code provides a mixin class for survival analysis, offering functions to predict survival and hazard functions, and to evaluate model performance using the concordance index.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the 'baseline_model' parameter (model object), 'prediction' arrays, and input features 'X' and labels 'y' for scoring.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the use of 'concordance_index_censored' function for evaluation and 'np.empty' for array creation, but no untrusted data is directly written to sensitive locations or transmitted externally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (prediction, model, data arrays) into functions that generate survival/hazard functions or scores, with no external data transmission or system modifications observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or malicious code constructs detected. The code appears to be standard implementation of survival analysis functions using common libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of survival analysis mixin functions, relying on external libraries (numpy, sksurv). It contains no indications of malicious behavior such as code injection, backdoors, or unauthorized data transmission. It reads input data from function parameters and processes them locally to generate statistical outputs. There are no signs of obfuscation, unusual dynamic code execution, or hidden behaviors. The use of standard functions and licensing comments suggests it is legitimate and intended for statistical modeling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign implementation of survival analysis utilities with no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is safe for use and does not contain malicious or suspicious activity.",
