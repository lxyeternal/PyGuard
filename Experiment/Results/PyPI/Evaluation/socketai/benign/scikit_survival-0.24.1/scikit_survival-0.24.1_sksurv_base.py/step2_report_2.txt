  "review": "Let's review each report carefully, assessing the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the assigned scores.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward survival analysis mixin, with no anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** The reasoning is sound; the code uses standard libraries, clear logic, and no suspicious constructs.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** The conclusion aligns with the analysis. No issues here.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it describes a standard implementation with no malicious behavior.\n- **Analysis:** The reasoning is consistent; the code reads model attributes and performs statistical computations without suspicious operations.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion is justified.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard survival analysis utility with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** The reasoning is detailed and consistent; no suspicious data handling or code constructs are observed.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** The securityRisk score is slightly above zero, but given the code's benign nature, this seems conservative. No malware or obfuscation concerns.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports; standard implementation with no malicious intent.\n- **Analysis:** The reasoning confirms the absence of suspicious behavior, with legitimate use of libraries and data.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and justified.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a typical survival analysis class with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** The reasoning is thorough; no suspicious patterns or external threats are identified.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly lower confidence, but still consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, which aligns with the code's purpose and structure.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation is detected; all reports confirm clarity and standard libraries.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Very low (0.1) in some reports, justified by the absence of external data leaks, backdoors, or unsafe operations.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a standard, well-structured survival analysis utility class.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious intent or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, standard code)\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, mostly due to the potential for misuse in untrusted environments, but no actual risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, legitimate, and appropriate for use in production environments.",
