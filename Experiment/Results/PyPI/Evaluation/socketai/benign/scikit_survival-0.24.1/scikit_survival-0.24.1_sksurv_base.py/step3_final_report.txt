  "purpose": "A survival analysis mixin providing functions to predict survival and hazard functions, and compute concordance index.",
  "sources": "Model attributes (e.g., unique_times_), input data (X, y), and prediction scores.",
  "sinks": "Returns of functions, external metric calculation (concordance_index_censored). No external data leaks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into prediction functions; outputs are survival/hazard functions or metrics.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of survival analysis utilities, utilizing common libraries (numpy) and straightforward logic. It calls model methods to retrieve survival and hazard functions, and computes the concordance index using an external metric. No suspicious data handling, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present. The code is well-structured, with clear parameter usage and documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign survival analysis utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. It is well-structured, transparent, and safe for use.",
