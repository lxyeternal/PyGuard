  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's logic, potential security issues, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code is a survival analysis mixin, with no external input sources besides passed parameters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No suspicious sinks; data flows are standard.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The report correctly identifies the code as a straightforward, legitimate implementation with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — justified.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — justified.  \n- Risk: 0 — justified, as no security concerns are evident.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, standard survival analysis functions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No suspicious external data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns or code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is standard, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — justified.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — justified.  \n- Risk: 0 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, standard survival analysis utilities.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data transmission or external communication.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is benign, with a security risk score of 0.1, which is marginally above zero. Given the absence of any suspicious activity, this might be slightly overestimated but is acceptable as a conservative estimate.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — justified.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — justified.  \n- SecurityRisk: 0.1 — acceptable, given no real vulnerabilities.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard survival analysis functions, no external threats.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No suspicious data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate utility class, with no malware or malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — justified.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — justified.  \n- SecurityRisk: 0.1 — acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores align with the report's findings.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard survival analysis methods.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks or suspicious data flows.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a typical implementation with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — justified.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — justified.  \n- SecurityRisk: 0 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; all should be 0.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports, which is acceptable given the lack of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations\n\nBased on the detailed review:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 or 0.1 — I suggest 0.0, as there's no security risk identified.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, well-structured survival analysis utility with no security concerns. The slightly elevated risk scores in some reports are conservative but acceptable; I would set them to zero for clarity.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is safe, legitimate, and contains no malware or obfuscation. The risk scores could be lowered to zero, reflecting the absence of security issues.",
