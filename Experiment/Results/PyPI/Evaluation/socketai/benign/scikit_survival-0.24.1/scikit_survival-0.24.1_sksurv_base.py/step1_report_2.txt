{
  "purpose": "The code provides methods for survival analysis, including predicting survival and cumulative hazard functions, and computing concordance index, primarily for use in statistical modeling and evaluation.",
  "sources": "The code reads model attributes (e.g., 'unique_times_', model methods like 'get_survival_function', 'get_cumulative_hazard_function'), input data 'X' and structured array 'y'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data could be risk scores or input features 'X' and 'y', but there are no explicit data leaks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Input data 'X' and 'y' flow into methods for predictions and scoring; risk scores are computed and returned, but no untrusted data is sent externally or manipulated maliciously.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements. The code relies on standard libraries and model attributes, with no signs of malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of survival analysis functions, including prediction and scoring, with clear parameter descriptions and method structures. No data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code is present. All operations are related to statistical computation and model evaluation. The imports and method calls are typical for such tasks, with no dynamic code execution or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate survival analysis utility class with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as expected for its purpose, with no evidence of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
