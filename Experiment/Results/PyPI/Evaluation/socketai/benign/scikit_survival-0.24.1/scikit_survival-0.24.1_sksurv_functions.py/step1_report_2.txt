  "purpose": "Implement a configurable step function for use in mathematical or machine learning models.",
  "sources": "Input data for the step function (x and y arrays), domain parameters, and evaluation points (x in __call__).",
  "sinks": "Evaluation of the step function at input values, no external data sinks or network connections present.",
  "flows": "Input data (x, y) -> __init__ method storing parameters -> __call__ method evaluating function at given points.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. No unusual code constructs or obfuscation detected. Uses numpy and sklearn validation without external or unsafe calls.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for a piecewise constant (step) function with configurable parameters and domain. It performs input validation, array operations, and evaluation without executing external code or network activity. The logic is straightforward and intended for mathematical modeling. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or obfuscation, are present. It strictly adheres to normal Python and numpy usage patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a mathematical step function with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain any suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The code is safe for use in a larger project context.",
