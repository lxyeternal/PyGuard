  "purpose": "Define a customizable step function for mathematical computations with configurable domain and parameters.",
  "sources": "Input data `x` and `y` arrays during class instantiation, evaluation input `x` in `__call__` method.",
  "sinks": "The `__call__` method processes `x` values; no data is written or transmitted outside the environment.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from instantiation and evaluation parameters; no external data flow or network activity observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual dynamic code, or obfuscation detected. The code is a standard mathematical class implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and performs data validation and numerical operations. The class `StepFunction` constructs a piecewise step function with configurable parameters, including domain limits. The `__call__` method evaluates the function at provided points, ensuring inputs are within the specified domain. There are no indications of malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, network activity, backdoors, or code injection. The structure is straightforward, and all operations are typical for mathematical modeling. No suspicious code patterns or hidden functionalities are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a standard mathematical step function class with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The code appears safe and suitable for use in data processing or modeling tasks.",
