  "purpose": "Implementation of a mathematical step function with configurable parameters and domain constraints.",
  "sources": "Input parameters x, y, a, b, and domain; internal validation functions.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or network communication; evaluation occurs locally.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into class initialization and __call__ method for evaluation; no external data leaks or network flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a standard, well-structured class for a piecewise step function, including input validation, domain management, and evaluation logic. It does not perform any external communication, dynamic code execution, or contain suspicious patterns. The implementation is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, benign mathematical utility implementing a configurable step function. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
