  "purpose": "Implementation of a mathematical step function that maps input values to output based on specified thresholds and parameters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to __init__ (x, y, domain), method __call__ (x), and property domain.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data; no output functions that leak data or execute system commands.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from method parameters through computations to output, with no external calls or data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual dynamic code execution, or suspicious variable use.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for a mathematical step function with configurable parameters and domain constraints. It performs input validation, ensures consistent array lengths, and clips input values to the domain. The implementation is straightforward, using numpy for numerical operations. No network operations, system commands, or external data handling are present. The code appears to be a standard mathematical utility without any malicious or suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a mathematical step function with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It operates purely as a mathematical utility without any malicious behaviors or external communication.",
