{
  "purpose": "Define a mathematical step function class for use in data processing or modeling.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to the constructor (__init__) and __call__ method; class attributes.",
  "sinks": "None present; the code does not perform any network operations, file I/O, or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Input data to constructor parameters, then to __call__ method for evaluation; no external data flows or outputs observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is a standard implementation of a step function.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for a step function with methods for initialization, evaluation, and representation. It uses numpy and sklearn utilities for data validation. The class performs input validation, range checks, and mapping of input values to output values based on the defined step function. No network activity, file operations, or dynamic code execution is present. The code is well-structured, documented, and appears to serve a mathematical or data processing purpose without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign mathematical utility class implementing a step function. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling mechanisms. No security risks or malware indicators are present.",
