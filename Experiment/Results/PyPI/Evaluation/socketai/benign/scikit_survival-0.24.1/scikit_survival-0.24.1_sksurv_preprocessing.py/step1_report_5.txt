{
  "purpose": "Implementation of a scikit-learn compatible transformer for encoding categorical features using one-hot encoding.",
  "sources": "Data input from pandas DataFrame during fit, fit_transform, and transform methods.",
  "targets": "Transformation methods that modify or create new DataFrame columns, primarily data encoding operations.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through fit_transform or transform, encoding categorical columns into numeric representations, with internal state tracking categories and feature names.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior observed. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Use of standard scikit-learn and pandas operations. No network access or system modifications present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a scikit-learn transformer class for categorical data encoding. It uses standard pandas and scikit-learn validation functions. Methods include fitting, transforming, and feature name handling, with no external data fetching, network calls, or system modifications. No malicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code segments detected. The code appears to be a typical implementation of a feature encoder aligned with common data processing workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of a categorical feature encoder for machine learning pipelines. No evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The code solely performs data transformation tasks using common libraries without any suspicious behavior.",
