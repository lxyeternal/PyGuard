  "purpose": "A scikit-learn transformer class for encoding categorical features using one-hot encoding, with options to drop categories with a single value.",
  "sources": "DataFrame columns with object or category dtype, especially during fit and transform methods.",
  "sinks": "Transformed DataFrame with encoded categorical features, no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Data is read from input DataFrame, categories are identified, and encoded features are generated and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic detected. External function `encode_categorical` is a dependency but appears benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a scikit-learn transformer for categorical encoding. It performs data validation, identifies categorical columns, encodes them, and manages feature names and categories. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are evident. The external dependency `encode_categorical` could be scrutinized further, but based on the context, it appears to be a typical encoding function. The code does not perform network operations, file I/O, or system modifications. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured implementation of a categorical encoder for machine learning pipelines. No malicious activity or security risks are present. The low risk score is appropriate, assuming external dependencies are trustworthy.",
