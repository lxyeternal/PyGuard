{
  "purpose": "The code implements a custom OneHotEncoder class for encoding categorical data, compatible with scikit-learn pipelines.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from pandas DataFrame objects passed to fit, fit_transform, and transform methods. It accesses DataFrame columns and their categories.",
  "sinks": "Potential data modifications occur within DataFrame column manipulations, and encoded feature names are generated. No direct sinks for untrusted data leading to system effects are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input DataFrame into the encode_categorical function, and resulting encoded columns are stored and returned. Encoded data replaces original categorical columns during transformation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior detected. The code follows typical scikit-learn transformer pattern, with proper checks and attribute settings. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a scikit-learn compatible transformer for one-hot encoding categorical features. It retrieves categorical columns, encodes them, stores feature and category info, and performs consistent transformations. All operations seem standard, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious network activity, or data exfiltration. External function encode_categorical is assumed to perform encoding reliably. The code uses validation and feature checks properly. No suspicious code flow, hardcoded credentials, or harmful system calls are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a scikit-learn transformer for categorical encoding, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a typical, well-structured data processing class, with no anomalies or malware detected.",
