  "purpose": "Implementation of survival analysis estimators including Kaplan-Meier, Nelson-Aalen, and cumulative incidence functions, using numpy and scipy for statistical calculations and validation.",
  "sources": "Input data arrays for event indicators and times, read via check_y_survival and check_array functions.",
  "sinks": "Outputs are survival probabilities, confidence intervals, and inverse probability weights; no external system interactions or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays through validation functions into statistical computations, producing survival estimates and confidence intervals as outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected; code is standard, well-documented scientific implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard survival analysis calculations with proper validation, uses common scientific libraries, and contains no external communication or obfuscated segments. It implements well-known statistical formulas for survival functions, hazard estimates, and confidence intervals, with appropriate validation and error handling. No signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent implementation of survival analysis estimators. No malicious activity, sabotage, or security risks are detected. The minor security risk score in one report (0.1) is unjustified given the code's nature and should be set to 0. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly assigned as 0. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use.",
