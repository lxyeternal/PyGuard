  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent implementation of survival analysis estimators. No malicious activity, sabotage, or security risks are detected. The minor security risk score in one report (0.1) is unjustified given the code's nature and should be set to 0. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly assigned as 0. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use."
