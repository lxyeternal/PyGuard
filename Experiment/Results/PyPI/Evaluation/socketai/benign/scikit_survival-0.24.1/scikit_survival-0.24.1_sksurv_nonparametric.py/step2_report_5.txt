  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the evidence they present, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a legitimate implementation of survival estimators, no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.0\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the detailed analysis. The code is standard, well-documented, and uses common scientific libraries. No suspicious behaviors or code patterns are identified.\n- **Verdict:** The scoring appears reasonable. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, the code is a standard survival analysis implementation with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.0\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is thorough, emphasizing the absence of suspicious code, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- **Verdict:** The scores are appropriate. No change necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is a standard survival analysis library, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.95\n- **Assessment:** The only point of contention is the `securityRisk=0.1`. Given the detailed analysis and absence of any suspicious code, this seems overestimated.\n- **Recommendation:** Set `securityRisk=0` to reflect the thorough analysis indicating no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a legitimate survival analysis implementation, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.0\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent and comprehensive.\n- **Verdict:** The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard survival analysis implementation, with no malicious activity or sabotage.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** The confidence score is slightly less than 1, which is reasonable given the generality, but the analysis indicates no issues.\n- **Recommendation:** Keep as is, or consider increasing confidence to 1.0, but it's acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, which is justified given the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Security risk:** Reports 1, 2, 4, and 5 assign 0, which is appropriate. Report 3 assigns 0.1, but based on the detailed analysis, this overestimates the risk.\n\n### Final Estimated Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no signs of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (code is clear and well-structured)\n- **Security risk:** **0** (no vulnerabilities or malicious activity detected)\n\n### Additional Justification:\n\n- The code performs standard statistical estimations using numpy, scipy, and scikit-learn.\n- No network activity, file operations, or code obfuscation are present.\n- The detailed analysis confirms the code's legitimacy and safety.\n\n**Summary:** I agree with the reports' assessments, with a slight correction to reduce the security risk score in Report 3 to 0. The malware and obfuscation scores should remain at 0 across all reports.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Security Risk | Confidence |\n|---------|---------|--------------|----------------|------------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0              | 1.0        |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0              | 1.0        |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | **0**          | 0.95       |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0              | 1.0        |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0              | 1.0        |\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms the code's integrity and safety.",
