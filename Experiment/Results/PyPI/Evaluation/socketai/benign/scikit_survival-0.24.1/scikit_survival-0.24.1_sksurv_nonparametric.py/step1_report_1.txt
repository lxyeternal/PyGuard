{
  "purpose": "This code provides statistical estimators for survival analysis, including Kaplan-Meier, Nelson-Aalen, and cumulative incidence functions, with methods to compute confidence intervals and inverse probability weights.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from structured arrays, array inputs such as event indicators, times, and risk indicators. Uses numpy functions for data processing and validation functions for input correctness.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include survival probabilities, confidence intervals, inverse probability weights, and cumulative incidence functions. No code writes to files or external systems.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays (event indicators, times) through estimation functions, with computations for risk counts, survival probabilities, and confidence intervals, returning statistical summaries. No external untrusted data flows to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious control flows detected. The code strictly performs statistical computations and data validation. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or misleading variable usage observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements well-known survival analysis estimators using numpy and scipy, with input validation and detailed documentation. The functions operate on data arrays, compute counts and risks, and produce statistical estimations. No network activity, file operations, or system modifications are present. The code appears to be standard, legitimate scientific computation code without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate implementation of survival analysis estimators with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It follows standard practices for data validation and statistical computation. No suspicious or malicious code segments detected.",
