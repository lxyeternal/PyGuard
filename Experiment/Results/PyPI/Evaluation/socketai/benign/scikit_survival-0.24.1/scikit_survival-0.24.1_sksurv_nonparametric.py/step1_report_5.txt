{
  "purpose": "This code implements statistical estimators related to survival analysis, including Kaplan-Meier, Nelson-Aalen, and cumulative incidence functions, with support for confidence intervals and various variance estimators.",
  "sources": "Code reads input data from function parameters, including event indicators, survival times, and structured arrays representing survival data.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include functions computing inverse probabilities and confidence intervals, which could leak untrusted or sensitive data if misused, but are standard for statistical tools.",
  "flows": "Input data (events, times) flow into estimation functions; outputs include survival probabilities, confidence intervals, and weights; no suspicious data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The code employs standard numpy/scipy functions for statistical calculations and proper data validation. No obfuscated language features or unnecessary dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs statistical survival analysis using standard methods (Kaplan-Meier, Nelson-Aalen, etc.). It includes data validation, structured handling of survival data, and confidence interval calculations. No network calls, system modifications, or suspicious external interactions are detected. The functions and class are consistent with their intended statistical use. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration or backdoors, are evident. The code is well-structured, uses open-source libraries appropriately, and appears to be part of a legitimate survival analysis package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of survival analysis estimators, with no malicious behavior or sabotage detected. It appears to be a legitimate, open-source statistical tool for survival data analysis. No security risks or malware signals identified.",
