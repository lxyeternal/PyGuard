{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions and classes for survival analysis, including estimators for survival functions, hazard functions, and cumulative incidence in the context of censored and competing risks data.",
  "sources": "Reads structured array input 'y' for survival data, including event indicators and times; accesses numpy arrays and scipy.stats for statistical calculations.",
  "sinks": "Returns estimated survival probabilities, confidence intervals, inverse probability weights, and other statistical measures; no evident data leaks or untrusted data processing occurs.",
  "flows": "Input structured arrays (y) -> internal computations and statistical estimations -> output arrays of survival functions, confidence intervals, weights, or cumulative incidences.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; all functions perform standard survival analysis calculations. No use of dynamic code execution, obfuscated features, or unusual variable names. The code relies solely on well-established scientific libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically implements survival analysis estimators with proper parameter validation, checks, and standard statistical formulas. It uses numpy and scipy for calculations, adhering to typical patterns in statistical software. No signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, file manipulation, or covert data collection. The code appears well-structured, readable, and consistent with standard survival analysis methodology. There are no signs of obfuscation or hidden malicious intent. The functionality is aligned with established survival analysis techniques, and all operations are transparent and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of survival analysis estimators with no detectable malicious behavior or sabotage. It is designed for statistical calculations related to survival functions, hazard functions, and cumulative incidences, and relies solely on scientific libraries. There are no indications of security risks or malware within this module.",
