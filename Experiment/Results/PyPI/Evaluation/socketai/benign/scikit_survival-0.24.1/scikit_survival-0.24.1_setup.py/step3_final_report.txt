{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a setup and cleanup utility for a Python package involving Cython and C++ extensions, managing build artifacts and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads input from environment variables, filesystem (os.walk, Path), and package configuration data.",
  "sinks": "Deletes cache and build files using shutil.rmtree and Path.unlink, which are standard cleanup operations.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (filesystem, environment variables) lead to cleanup functions and dependency checks; no untrusted data flows to security-sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected; code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The script performs routine build and cleanup tasks, including dependency verification, extension compilation, and artifact removal. It does not execute untrusted code, connect to networks, or manipulate data in suspicious ways. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's operations are typical for open-source package setup scripts involving Cython and C++ extensions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to routine cleanup operations. All reports correctly identify its safe and standard nature. Final scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 (reflecting routine cleanup), confidence=1.",
