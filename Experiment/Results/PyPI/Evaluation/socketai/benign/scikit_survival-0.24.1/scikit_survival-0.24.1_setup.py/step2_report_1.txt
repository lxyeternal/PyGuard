  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and the appropriateness of the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard build and cleanup script for a Python package involving Cython and C++ extensions. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is sound. The code performs typical setup and cleanup routines with no signs of malicious activity. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard build procedures, dependency checks, and cleanup routines. No suspicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe securityRisk score is very low (0.1), which seems reasonable given the benign nature of the script. No malware or obfuscation, and the reasoning is consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a typical setup script managing Cython extensions, dependency checks, and cleanup. No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nScores align with the analysis. No suspicious activities are present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, standard build/cleanup operations with dependency verification and extension compilation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAppropriate scores; no malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above; standard build and cleanup routines, dependency checks, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious code. The scripts do not execute untrusted code, do not perform network activity, or contain backdoors. **Final malware score: 0.0**\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation or code hiding techniques are present. The code is clear, well-structured, and typical for build scripts. **Final obfuscated score: 0.0**\n\n- **Risk Score:** The scripts are standard build utilities with no malicious intent. The only minor concern could be the use of `shutil.rmtree` and file unlinking, but these are standard cleanup operations. The reports assign very low security risk scores (0.1), which is reasonable. **Final risk score: 0.1**\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.1\n\nThese scores reflect the benign, standard nature of the code. The detailed reasoning across all reports confirms that there are no malicious or obfuscated elements, and the minimal security risk is due to routine cleanup operations.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nThe overall assessment aligns with the reports. No further action is necessary, and the code is safe.",
