{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for building and cleaning a Python package with Cython extensions, primarily for compiling C/C++ extensions from specified sources.",
  "sources": "Sources are primarily located in the 'sksurv' directory for Cython and C++ files, and environment variables are checked for build options.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network, file writing, or system command execution are present in the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from source files in 'sksurv' (for compilation) and environment variables (for build options); no untrusted data flows to critical operations such as network or file system modifications.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are evident. The code follows typical setup script procedures with standard library usage and Cython integration.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup activities: cleaning build artifacts, managing Cython extension compilation, and ensuring dependencies and source code are present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. It verifies Cython version, handles extension compilation, and updates submodules as needed. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious system modifications are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate build and setup script for a scientific Python package involving Cython extensions. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or malware indications. Its primary function is to compile Cython and C++ extensions safely.",
