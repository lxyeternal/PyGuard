{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to facilitate the setup, build, and clean processes for a Python package involving Cython extensions and C++ sources.",
  "sources": "File system operations (os.walk, Path), environment variables (os.environ), input modules (setuptools, numpy, Cython, sys), and package source files.",
  "sinks": "Deletion of files/directories during cleanup, import statements, and build processes. No execution of untrusted input data or network operations observed.",
  "flows": "Initialization options gather files for deletion; build functions import and check modules; setup processes compile Cython extensions from source files; cleanup removes specific cache and build files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code performs standard build and cleanup routines. No obfuscated or misleading code patterns. No dynamic execution of untrusted data or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs routine setup and cleanup operations for a Python package with Cython extensions. It checks for the presence of required modules and versions, manages source files, and prepares extensions for compilation. The cleanup class deletes cache and build files safely. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or network activity. All operations are typical for package setup scripts. The absence of any obfuscated code, dynamic code execution from untrusted sources, or malicious side effects suggests a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard build and cleanup script for a Python package with Cython/C++ extensions. There are no indications of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It appears to be an ordinary, safe setup utility.",
