{
  "purpose": "This script is used for setting up, cleaning, and compiling a Python package with Cython extensions, primarily related to the 'sksurv' library.",
  "sources": "User inputs via command line arguments (sys.argv), environment variables (os.environ), file system reads (os.walk, Path.exists), and package imports (packaging.version, setuptools, numpy, Cython).",
  "sinks": "File deletions (shutil.rmtree, Path.unlink), potential extension compilation (cythonize), and module import checks (import Cython, numpy).",
  "flows": "Environment variables and command line arguments influence execution flow; file system checks and reads inform extension compilation; imports validate dependencies; cleanup deletes files/directories based on traversal; extension setup is performed based on configuration and conditions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors detected. The script performs standard setup and cleanup operations with no suspicious data exfiltration or malicious network activity. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code manages package setup, including cleaning build artifacts, checking for dependencies (Cython, numpy), and configuring Cython extensions. It performs standard validation, such as verifying Cython version and Eigen source directory presence. The cleanup class deletes cache files and build directories, which is typical for build scripts. It conditionally cythonizes extensions unless building source distributions or cleaning. No code is found that interacts with external networks, handles sensitive data, or performs unauthorized actions. All operations align with normal build processes, with no anomalies or suspicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided script is a standard build and setup utility for a Python package with Cython extensions. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code adheres to typical package setup practices and performs no suspicious activities.",
