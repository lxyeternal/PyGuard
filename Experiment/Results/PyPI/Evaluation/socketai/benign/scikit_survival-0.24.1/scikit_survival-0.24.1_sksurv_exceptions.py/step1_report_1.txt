  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling errors related to non-comparable pairs in censored event time data.",
  "sources": "No sources of input or data; the code only defines a class.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data processing or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow; this is a simple class definition with no runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class definition extending ValueError, with a descriptive docstring. It is a common pattern for custom exceptions in Python. No code injection, no data leaks, no use of environment variables, no malicious activity, and no obfuscated code. It is well-structured and adheres to standard coding practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard custom exception class with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
