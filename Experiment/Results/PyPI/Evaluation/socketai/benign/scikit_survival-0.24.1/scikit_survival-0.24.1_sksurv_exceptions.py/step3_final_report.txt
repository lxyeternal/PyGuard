  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling cases where censored event times lack comparable pairs.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code is a class definition with a docstring.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the class is a static exception definition with no runtime data movement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with standard class syntax and documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple class inheriting from ValueError, with a descriptive docstring. It contains no data processing, external input/output, dynamic execution, or obfuscation. The class is a standard pattern for custom exceptions in Python. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The code's purpose is clear, and it does not involve any security-sensitive operations or obfuscation techniques. The code's benign nature is confirmed by all reports, and no issues or risks are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard custom exception class with no malicious intent or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate. No further action or concern is necessary.",
