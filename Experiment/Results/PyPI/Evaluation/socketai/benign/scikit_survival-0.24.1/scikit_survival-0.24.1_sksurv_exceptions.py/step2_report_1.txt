  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the reported issues, scores, and potential risks.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code: a simple custom exception class inheriting from ValueError, with a descriptive docstring.\n- No data processing, external input/output, or dynamic code execution is involved.\n- The code is straightforward, well-structured, and adheres to standard Python practices.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security risks are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** The code does not contain any problematic issues; it's a benign class definition.\n- **Malware:** Score is 0 in all reports, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** Score is 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk:** Score is 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** All reports correctly identify the code as a standard, harmless exception class with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Scores and reasoning:\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the code.\n- The confidence level is 1.0, which is justified, as the code is straightforward and well-understood.\n- No adjustments needed based on the evidence.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- Since the code is only defining an exception class, it cannot be malicious or obfuscated.\n- The purpose of the class is clear, and it fits into typical exception handling patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk involved)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a benign, standard custom exception class with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** No further action or concern is necessary for this code snippet.",
