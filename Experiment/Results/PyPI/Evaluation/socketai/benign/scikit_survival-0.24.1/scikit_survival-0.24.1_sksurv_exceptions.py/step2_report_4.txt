  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the details:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports describe the code as a straightforward class definition of a custom exception inheriting from `ValueError`.\n   - The original code snippet confirms this: it's a minimal, standard class with a descriptive docstring.\n   - No data processing, external input/output, or dynamic code execution is present.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are detected.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they all correctly identify this as a benign, standard pattern.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n   - The descriptions of the code's purpose and behavior are accurate.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1.0, which seems justified.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is a simple exception class with no malicious activity, no reason exists to assign a higher risk score.\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports assign `malware` = 0, which is correct.\n   - No malicious behavior is suggested or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code and analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Code is straightforward and clear.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risk present.\n\n### My Reasoned Estimate:\n\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of this code, I would assign:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:** This code snippet is a standard, harmless custom exception class with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.",
