  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple, standard Python class defining a custom exception inheriting from `ValueError`.\n- The code is free of data processing, external input/output, or dynamic code execution.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security risks are detected.\n- The purpose across reports is consistent: to handle errors related to non-comparable or missing pairs in censored event time data.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code is a benign class definition, with no suspicious or malicious behavior.\n- The reports' confidence levels are all 1.0, which seems appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, aligning with the absence of malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the straightforward class definition.\n- The security risk score is 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code; no discrepancies or unreasonable scores are apparent.\n- The purpose of the code is clear, and the code matches the described purpose.\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Conclusion and my own assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, benign custom exception class.\n- There is no malware, obfuscation, or security concern.\n- The risk score should be 0, as there is no indication of any security threat.\n- The malware score should remain 0.\n- The obfuscated score should remain 0.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the reports' findings.",
