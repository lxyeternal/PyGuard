  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling specific errors related to incomparable data pairs in censored event time data.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; class definition and docstring within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; code is only defining an exception class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors are present; straightforward class declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a GPL-licensed class inheriting from ValueError with a descriptive docstring. It is a simple, standard Python class definition intended for use in exception handling. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. It solely defines a custom exception for specific error handling related to data comparisons in statistical or data processing contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal, benign exception class definition with no malicious intent or security risks.",
