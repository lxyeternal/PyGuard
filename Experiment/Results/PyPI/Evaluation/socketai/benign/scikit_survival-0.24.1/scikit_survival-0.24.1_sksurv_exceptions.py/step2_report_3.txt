  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the correctness of the findings, the scoring, and any potential security implications.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code: a simple custom exception class inheriting from ValueError with a descriptive docstring.\n- The code is straightforward, with no data processing, external input/output, or dynamic behavior.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are present.\n- The consistent conclusion across reports aligns with expectations for such a benign class definition.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly identify that the code is just a class definition with no malicious or suspicious content.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- **Logical or reasoning flaws?**  \n  No. The reports are accurate; the code is benign, and their conclusions are justified.\n\n### Score Evaluations:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- No reason exists to assign a higher risk or malware score since there's no malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- Some reports mention that the code \"appears to be part of a larger data analysis library,\" which is reasonable, but this does not impact the security assessment—it's just contextual.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the simplicity and clarity of the code, the reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard, harmless custom exception class with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify that this is a benign, standard Python exception class with no security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate, and there is no need for adjustment.",
