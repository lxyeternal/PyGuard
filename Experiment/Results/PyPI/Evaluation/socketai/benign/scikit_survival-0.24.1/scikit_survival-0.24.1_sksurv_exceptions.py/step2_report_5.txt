  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple class definition for a custom exception inheriting from `ValueError`.\n- The code is consistent across reports: no data processing, no external input/output, no dynamic code, no obfuscation.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which is correct.\n- The security risk is 0 in all cases, consistent with the benign, non-executable class definition.\n- The confidence scores are 1.0, which seems appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Confirming the issues:**\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious activity, obfuscation, or security flaws.\n- It is a standard custom exception class, commonly used in Python for error handling.\n- No signs of code injection, data leaks, or suspicious constructs.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is accurate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is correct.\n- **Risk score:** Given the code's benign nature, a score of 0 is appropriate. No potential vulnerabilities or security risks are present.\n\n**Potential points of contention:**\n- The reports consistently assign a risk score of 0, which is justified.\n- The malware and obfuscated scores are also 0, matching the code's nature.\n- No changes are necessary for the scores.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a straightforward, benign class definition for a custom exception.\n- No malicious or suspicious activity is present.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's benign and standard nature.",
