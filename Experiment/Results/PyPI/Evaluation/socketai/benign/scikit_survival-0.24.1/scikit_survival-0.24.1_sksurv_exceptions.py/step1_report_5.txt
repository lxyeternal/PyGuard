{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling cases where censored event times lack comparable pairs.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; class definition does not include input handling.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present in the code.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow, input, or output operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard Python class declaration with a docstring.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward definition of a custom exception class inheriting from ValueError, with an informative docstring. It contains no input/output operations, no use of external data sources, no hardcoded credentials, and no suspicious constructs. The code appears to be part of a larger statistical or data analysis package but itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign class definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as a custom error indicator for specific data validation scenarios.",
