{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling cases where no comparable pairs are found in censored event time data.",
  "sources": "No input sources; the code is a class definition with a docstring.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no data processing, I/O, or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the class is only a type definition with no runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of anomalies; the code is straightforward and contains no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class inheriting from ValueError, with a descriptive docstring. It is a typical pattern for exception handling in Python. No external data, dynamic code execution, or suspicious logic is present. The code appears to be part of a larger data analysis library, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple class definition serving as a custom exception. It contains no malicious behavior, no obfuscated code, and poses no security threats. It is a benign, standard pattern in Python programming.",
