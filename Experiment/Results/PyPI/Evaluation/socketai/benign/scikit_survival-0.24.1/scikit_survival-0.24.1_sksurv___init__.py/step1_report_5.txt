{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for version reporting, system info display, and method patching for scikit-survival pipeline objects, as well as property accessors for risk scoring methods.",
  "sources": "Reads package versions using importlib.metadata.version, platform and sys modules for environment info, and input data X for prediction functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks identified. No external network communications or file manipulations are present.",
  "flows": "Input data X flows through transformation steps in predict methods, but no untrusted data is processed insecurely or sent externally.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; the code performs standard version checks, info display, and method patching. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for displaying system and dependency versions, patching scikit-learn Pipelines with custom prediction methods, and property accessors. Version retrieval is done via standard library functions with error handling. The predict functions perform data transformations and call underlying model methods. Patching functions modify the Pipeline class dynamically. No malicious or suspicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors is present. The code appears intended for benign extension or customization of scikit-learn pipelines.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility and patching script intended to enhance scikit-learn pipeline functionality with version info and prediction methods. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements and poses no security risks.",
