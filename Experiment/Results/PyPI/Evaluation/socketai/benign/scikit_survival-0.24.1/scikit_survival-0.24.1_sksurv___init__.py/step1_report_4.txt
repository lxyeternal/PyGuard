{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for displaying system and dependency versions, and extends the scikit-learn Pipeline class with additional prediction methods related to survival analysis models.",
  "sources": "Reads system information via platform and sys modules, fetches package versions using importlib.metadata.version, accesses object attributes such as self._iter and self.steps.",
  "sinks": "None identified that process untrusted data for effects like data leakage, system compromise, or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code primarily performs utility functions, method extensions, and version retrievals without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors detected. The code imports standard libraries, extends known classes, and retrieves package versions. It contains no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and third-party libraries, primarily for version reporting and extending the scikit-learn Pipeline class with additional survival analysis prediction methods. It uses exception handling when fetching package versions, which is normal practice. The functions extend existing classes without executing untrusted code or performing network operations. The patch_pipeline function modifies the Pipeline class to add new methods, which is a common pattern in Python for extending third-party libraries. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden payloads. The code is well-structured, readable, and focuses on utility and extension without suspicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, providing version info and extending a scikit-learn Pipeline with survival analysis prediction methods. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior is detected. It appears to be part of a standard package enhancement or utility module.",
