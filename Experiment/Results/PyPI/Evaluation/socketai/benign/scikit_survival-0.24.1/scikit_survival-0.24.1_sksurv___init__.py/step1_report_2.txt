{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for displaying system and dependency versions, as well as extending the scikit-survival Pipeline with additional prediction methods.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (importlib.metadata, platform, sys), third-party libraries (sklearn), and internal utility modules (.util). Reads package version info, system info, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions contain unsafe code execution or untrusted data handling. No data is sent over the network, written to files, or executed dynamically.",
  "flows": "The version retrieval flows from package name to version string. The show_versions() function reads system info and dependency versions, then prints them. The pipeline patch adds methods to the Pipeline class without executing untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code primarily performs version checks, info display, and method patching. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code checks for package versions, displays system and dependency info, and dynamically adds methods to scikit-learn's Pipeline class. All operations are straightforward, primarily involving information retrieval and method assignment. The version fetching uses try-except for PackageNotFoundError, which is standard. The patch_pipeline() function modifies existing classes in a benign manner. No suspicious or malicious activities are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility module aimed at enhancing scikit-survival functionality and system diagnostics. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
