{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for displaying system and dependency versions, and extends the scikit-learn Pipeline class with additional prediction methods for survival analysis models.",
  "sources": "Reads include version retrieval via importlib.metadata and package version checks, as well as attribute access within class methods and properties.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve method overrides and property definitions that access internal model steps, but do not process untrusted external data directly.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves package versions, calls transform methods on input data within prediction functions, and patches the Pipeline class with new methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code detected. The patching of the Pipeline class could modify behavior, but is transparent and controlled.",
  "analysis": "The code imports system and package version info, defines functions to display system/dependencies, and extends sklearn's Pipeline with survival analysis methods. These methods transform input data via existing pipeline steps and invoke model prediction functions, with no untrusted data processing or external network interactions. The version retrieval and patching are standard practices. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration are observed. The code's structure and logic are straightforward and legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility extension for survival analysis pipelines using scikit-learn, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It mainly reads package info, extends class methods, and patches existing classes without processing untrusted data or performing harmful actions.",
