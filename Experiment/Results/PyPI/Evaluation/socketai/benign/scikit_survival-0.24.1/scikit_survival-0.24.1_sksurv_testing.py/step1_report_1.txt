{
  "purpose": "The code provides testing utilities and helper functions for survival analysis estimators within the sksurv package, including assertions for survival function properties, concordance index, and hazard functions.",
  "sources": "Imports data from sksurv modules, numpy, pytest, and standard library modules; functions access internal sksurv modules dynamically via import_module and pkgutil.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is written or transmitted; no network connections, file writing, or external process invocation observed.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from test functions and helper methods into assertions for survival and hazard functions, with no external data sinks or outputs involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs. The dynamic import and inspection of modules could potentially be misused to load unintended modules, but within this context, it appears solely for testing utility discovery.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily defines assertion functions for survival analysis metrics, helper functions to identify estimator classes, and a factory class to generate test cases. The code uses safe Python introspection and standard library features. No code injection, malicious network activity, or data leakage mechanisms are present. The dynamic module loading is standard for testing frameworks and does not exhibit malicious intent. The code’s structure is clean, with no obfuscated or suspicious patterns. It does not perform any external communication, data exfiltration, or system manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard testing utility module for survival analysis estimators, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to serve purely as a testing aid within the sksurv library. The overall security risk is low.",
