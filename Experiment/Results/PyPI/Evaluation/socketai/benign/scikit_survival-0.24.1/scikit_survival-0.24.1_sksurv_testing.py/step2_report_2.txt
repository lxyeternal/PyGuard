  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the appropriateness of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code is for testing utilities within sksurv, importing modules dynamically for utility discovery.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data sinks or flows involving untrusted data.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated patterns. Dynamic import is standard for testing.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a standard testing utility, with no malicious behavior. The confidence score is high (0.9). Malware and security risk are both 0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThis report's reasoning is sound. The code is clearly for testing, with no signs of malicious activity. The scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for testing survival models, no external untrusted data involved.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data processing, only internal validation.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code performs internal validation with no malicious intent. Confidence is perfect (1.0). Malware and security risk are both 0 or very minimal.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is consistent. The code is a testing utility with no malicious activity. The scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Validation functions for survival models, class inspection, and test case generation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data processing or external communication.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard testing code, safe, with no malicious behavior. High confidence, minimal risk.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning aligns with the code's nature. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Validation of survival functions and metrics, no external data or network activity.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data sinks or malicious data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Safe internal validation code, no signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is thorough and correct. The scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for testing estimators, class and module inspection.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a testing utility with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is consistent. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** None of the reports identify actual issues or malicious code. They all conclude the code is safe, primarily utility functions for testing.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware scores of 0 or very close to 0, and security risks are minimal (~0.1). This aligns with the analysis.\n- **Risk justification:** Since no malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present, higher risk scores are unjustified.\n- **Obfuscation:** None of the reports detect obfuscation; the code is straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n**Malware score:**  \nGiven the detailed analysis, the code contains no malicious activity. I agree with the scores of 0 across all reports.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**  \nNo obfuscation detected; scores of 0 are appropriate.\n\n**Risk score:**  \nThe code is purely for testing and validation, with no external data handling or network activity. A risk score of 0.1 is reasonable, reflecting minimal inherent risk but acknowledging that dynamic module import can sometimes be misused in other contexts.\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are consistent with my assessment. The code is a safe, standard testing utility within the sksurv package, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
