  "purpose": "Utility functions for testing survival analysis estimators in the sksurv package, including assertions for survival and hazard functions, and class discovery for estimators.",
  "sources": "Internal module imports, dynamic module inspection, class and function definitions, data validation functions.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network activity, or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Data flows within test functions and class inspection routines; no external untrusted data sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs internal validation and utility functions for survival analysis estimators, using dynamic imports and class inspection. It includes assertions for properties of survival and hazard functions, and discovery of estimator classes within the package. All operations are confined to internal testing and validation, with no external communication or malicious behavior. The dynamic import is standard for test suites and does not pose a security risk in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard testing utility module for the sksurv package, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low malware score (0), obfuscation score (0), and minimal security risk (0.1) are appropriate given its purpose.",
