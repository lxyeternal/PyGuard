  "purpose": "Utility functions for survival data processing, including creation of structured arrays from arrays and dataframes, and data validation routines for survival analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from arrays, dataframes, and object attributes for constructing structured arrays and validating survival data.",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission or malicious data handling; internal data validation and structuring only.",
  "flows": "Input data (arrays/dataframes) flow into validation functions and structured array creation routines, with no external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; code is transparent and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard survival data validation, structured array creation, and pandas data handling. It uses common libraries and includes no network or file operations. The custom property descriptor is used for conditional attribute access, not maliciously. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The functions are well-documented and follow best practices for data validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe utility module for survival analysis data management. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low risk scores assigned are appropriate given its functionality.",
