  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors in an OVSDB application, including detailed error messages and fallback behavior.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; the code defines classes and strings.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leakage points.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from source to sink as there are no input/output operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior; standard class and exception definitions with string formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes custom exception classes inheriting from RuntimeError, with message templates for specific error scenarios (timeout and connection failure). The __init__ method formats messages with provided kwargs and handles exceptions during formatting. The use of class attributes for message templates and formatted strings is typical and safe. No dynamic code execution, external inputs, or data leaks are present. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious constructs are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes intended for error handling within an OVSDB application. There are no indications of malicious intent, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities. It appears to be well-structured, safe, and free from malicious code.",
