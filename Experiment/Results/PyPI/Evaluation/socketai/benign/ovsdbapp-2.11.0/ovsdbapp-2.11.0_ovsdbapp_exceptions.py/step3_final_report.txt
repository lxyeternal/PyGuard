  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for OVSDB application errors with message templates formatted via kwargs.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; exception message templates used internally.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; exception messages are used for error reporting only.",
  "flows": "Exception instantiation with kwargs leading to formatted messages; no external data flow involved.",
  "anomalies": "Use of string formatting in exception messages is standard; no anomalies or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements straightforward custom exception classes inheriting from RuntimeError, with message templates formatted using kwargs. Error handling around message formatting is appropriate. No external data, network, or file operations are present. The code is clear, standard, and free of obfuscation or malicious constructs. The message formatting could theoretically be misused if untrusted data were passed, but in this context, the messages are static templates, and the risk is negligible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and free of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The minimal risk associated with message formatting is acceptable given the context. The existing reports' scores of malware 0, obfuscated 0, and very low security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
