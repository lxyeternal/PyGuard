  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n\n- The code defines custom exception classes with message templates that are formatted with keyword arguments.\n- No external data input, no data leaks, no network or file operations.\n- The use of string formatting in exception messages is standard and safe in this context.\n- No obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious code is present.\n- The code is straightforward, with proper error handling for message formatting failures.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Review:\n\n#### Presence of Issues:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify that the code is standard, benign, and free of malicious behavior.\n\n#### Logical Flaws or Mistakes:\n- **Any errors or flaws?**  \n  No. The use of string formatting with `kwargs` in exception messages is common, and the try-except block for formatting errors is appropriate.\n\n#### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign `0` or `0.1`. Given the absence of any malicious activity, code injection, or external data handling, a malware score of **0** is justified.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`, which is correct. No obfuscation is present.\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  Slightly above zero in some reports (`0.1`), possibly reflecting a minimal concern about message formatting if misused. However, since no external input is involved, and messages are static templates, this is very low. A score of **0** would be more appropriate.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  All reports assign `0` or `0.1`. The overall risk is minimal; thus, **0** is appropriate.\n\n#### Potential Vulnerabilities:\n- The only potential concern is if untrusted data is passed into exception messages, which could lead to message injection or misleading logs. However, in this code, the messages are static templates, and the data is supplied via `kwargs`. Even if `kwargs` contain untrusted data, it is only used in string formatting, not code execution.  \n- The exception handling around message formatting is good practice.\n\n#### Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:\n- No such claims are present; all reports correctly conclude the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n- **Security risk score:** **0** (more accurate than 0.1)  \n- **Overall risk score:** **0**\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes with message templates. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores should reflect this, with all being zero or near-zero.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** The initial report scores are reasonable but slightly overstate the security risk; a score of **0** for malware, obfuscated, and risk would be more accurate.",
