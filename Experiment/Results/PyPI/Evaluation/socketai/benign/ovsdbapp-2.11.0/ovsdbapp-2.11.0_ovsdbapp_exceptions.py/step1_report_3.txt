  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to OVSDB application operations.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; class definitions are static.",
  "sinks": "Exception message formatting with keyword arguments; potential for message injection if misused, but not applicable here as messages are static strings.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; exception handling does not process external data directly.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior; exception messages are static and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a base exception class 'OvsdbAppException' that formats messages using provided kwargs, and two subclasses for specific error types. The message formatting uses string interpolation, but the messages are static templates. The constructor attempts to format these messages, catching exceptions if formatting fails. There is no indication of data leakage, malicious code, or external data processing. The code is straightforward and typical for error handling in Python. No suspicious or malicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exceptions with safe message formatting. There are no signs of malicious activity, supply chain risks, or security vulnerabilities.",
