  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - The code defines custom exception classes inheriting from `RuntimeError`.\n   - Exception messages are stored as class attributes with string formatting placeholders.\n   - The `__init__` method formats these messages with provided keyword arguments (`kwargs`) and handles formatting errors gracefully.\n   - No external input/output, data sources, or network/file operations are involved.\n   - The code appears to be a standard, straightforward implementation for error handling in a Python project.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:\n   - No signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or backdoors.\n   - No hardcoded secrets or external data handling.\n   - The string formatting is safe in this context, as messages are static templates.\n   - The code does not perform any dynamic code execution or external system calls.\n\n3. **Analysis of Reported Scores**:\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n   - Security risk scores are very low (0 or 0.1), which is reasonable given the benign nature.\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is standard, safe, and free of vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Assumptions**:\n   - While the use of string formatting in exception messages could theoretically be exploited if untrusted data were passed, in this context, the messages are static templates, and any data passed via kwargs is controlled within the application.\n   - The only minor point is the `securityRisk` score of 0.1 in some reports, possibly reflecting a very minimal concern about message formatting if misused, but this is negligible here.\n\n5. **Overall Justification**:\n   - The code is not malicious, obfuscated, or insecure.\n   - The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments are necessary based on the provided information.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk score**: 0.0 to 0.1 (minimal, mostly theoretical concern)\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0.05 (very low, just acknowledging the minor risk associated with message formatting, but practically safe)\n\n**Conclusion**: The code is benign, standard, and safe. The existing report scores are accurate, and no changes are necessary.",
