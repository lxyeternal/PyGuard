  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific errors in OvsdbApp, with formatted messages.",
  "sources": "Input data for exception message formatting via keyword arguments in constructors.",
  "sinks": "Formatted exception messages that could potentially include untrusted input data if misused, but this is limited to logging or display, not execution.",
  "flows": "Input data (kwargs) -> formatted message in constructor -> stored as self.msg and displayed in __str__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses standard exception class inheritance, formatted message strings, and no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes inheriting from RuntimeError, with message templates that are formatted using provided keyword arguments. The __init__ method attempts to format messages and falls back gracefully if formatting fails. The use of string formatting for exception messages is common practice. There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, malicious code, or obfuscated logic. The exception classes are straightforward, and no external or untrusted data is processed beyond message formatting, which is safe in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes with formatted messages. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It appears to be well-structured, secure, and free of malicious intent.",
