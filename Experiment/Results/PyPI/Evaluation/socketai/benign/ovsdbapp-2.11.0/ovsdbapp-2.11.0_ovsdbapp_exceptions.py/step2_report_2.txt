  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and the assessments provided.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from RuntimeError.\n- Exception messages are stored as class attributes with string formatting placeholders.\n- The __init__ method attempts to format these messages with provided kwargs, catching exceptions if formatting fails.\n- No external input, data sources, or sinks are involved.\n- No network, file, or external system interactions are present.\n- The code appears standard, safe, and free of malicious or obfuscated constructs.\n\n---\n\n### Issue-by-issue review:\n\n#### Reports 1, 2, 3, 4, 5:\n- **Purpose:** All aim to define custom exception classes for OVSDB application errors.\n- **Sources/Sinks:** No external data handling, no data leaks.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of string formatting with kwargs is common and safe here.\n- **Analysis:** The formatting is within exception message templates, and the code handles formatting exceptions gracefully.\n- **Conclusion:** All reports agree that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; no obfuscation is present.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is justified; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **SecurityRisk:** Reports 4 and 5 assign a very low score (0.1), citing potential for message injection if misused. While message injection could be a concern if external input were processed directly into logs or displayed, in this context, the exception messages are static templates, and the formatting occurs with provided kwargs, not raw user input. Therefore, even these minimal scores are somewhat conservative but acceptable.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n\n- Since no external data is processed, and the code is purely defining exception classes, the overall security risk remains negligible.\n- The potential for message injection is minimal here, given the context and the controlled use of message templates.\n\n---\n\n### Malware and obfuscation scores:\n\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, which is appropriate; the code is straightforward.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- The code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exceptions.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior is present.\n- The slight differences in security risk scores (0.1 vs. 0) are acceptable but could be uniformly set to 0 for clarity.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimates:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk, given the code's nature)\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, with no supply chain or security concerns. The exception message formatting is safe in this context, and the code serves a standard purpose within an application.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No further action needed. The reports are consistent and accurate.",
