  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to OVS database application operations.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or sends data to external systems or untrusted destinations.",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "Code uses string formatting with keyword arguments in exception messages but employs try-except to handle potential formatting errors. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines exception classes inheriting from RuntimeError, with customizable messages using string formatting. The __init__ method attempts to format messages with provided kwargs, catching exceptions if formatting fails. The use of string formatting is standard for exception messages. No external input handling, data leaks, or malicious behavior detected. The code appears to be a standard implementation for custom exceptions. No obfuscated code or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes with no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is well-structured, with no suspicious activities or vulnerabilities.",
