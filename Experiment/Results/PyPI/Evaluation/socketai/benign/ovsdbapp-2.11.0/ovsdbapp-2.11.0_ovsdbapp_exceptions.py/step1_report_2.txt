  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for OVSDB application errors with formatted messages.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted input sources detected in the code.",
  "sinks": "No output or data handling that could lead to data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of string formatting with kwargs in exception messages, which is safe here. No signs of malicious or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines exception classes inheriting from RuntimeError. The message attribute supports string formatting with kwargs, allowing dynamic message construction. The constructor attempts to format messages with provided kwargs and handles exceptions gracefully. The use of formatted strings in exceptions is typical and safe. No external input handling, no network activity, no file operations, and no code injection mechanisms are present. The code appears straightforward and designed for error handling without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for an OpenStack-related project. It contains no suspicious behavior, no malware, and no security risks. It solely handles internal error reporting with formatted messages. Overall, the code is benign and safe.",
