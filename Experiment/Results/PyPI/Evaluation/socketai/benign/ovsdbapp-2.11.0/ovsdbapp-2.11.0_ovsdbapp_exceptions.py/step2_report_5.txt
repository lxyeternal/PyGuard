  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes with no external input, data leaks, or malicious behavior.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None. The reasoning is sound, and the code is standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0. The report's scores are appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The code is benign, with no suspicious activity.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. Similar to Report 1, it describes a standard pattern for custom exceptions.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None. The reasoning is consistent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0. The scores are justified.\n- **Justification:** No malicious intent or vulnerabilities detected.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The code remains a typical exception class definition.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None. The analysis confirms safe message formatting.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0. The scores are appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. Again, standard exception classes with safe message formatting.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None. The reasoning is consistent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.1. The small security risk score accounts for potential misuse if untrusted data is passed as kwargs, but since the code only formats messages, this is minimal.\n- **Justification:** Slightly higher security risk score is reasonable, but no malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The code defines exception classes with formatted messages and no external data processing.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None. The reasoning is correct.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.1. Again, the small risk accounts for potential misuse but is justified.\n- **Justification:** No malware or malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. I agree with the overall malware score of 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; scores are appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** The minimal security risk scores (~0.1) are justified given the use of string formatting with kwargs, which could be misused if external data were passed unchecked. However, in the current context, the code does not process external untrusted data directly, so the risk remains low.\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n- The code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exception classes.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or high-risk behavior is present.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The scores are appropriate. No changes needed. The code is safe and free from security issues.",
