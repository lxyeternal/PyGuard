{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for IP normalization, UUID generation, validation, and extraction, likely used within larger network or database management systems.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters such as IP addresses, port strings, and UUID strings. External libraries may provide data, but code itself does not read external inputs directly.",
  "sinks": "UUID generation functions and validation functions. No direct data sinks that could leak data or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (IP strings, UUID strings) are processed through normalization, validation, or formatting functions. The UUID functions generate or validate UUIDs without external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns observed. The code appears to be standard utility functions without hardcoded secrets or malicious constructs. No network operations, code injection, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides IP normalization with error handling for IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, including port parsing with validation. UUID generation uses standard library calls, with options for dashed or hex formats. UUID validation compares input strings with generated UUIDs after formatting, ensuring correctness. get_uuid extracts UUIDs from command objects or strings. No external input streams, system calls, or network activities are present. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behaviors identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions for IP address normalization and UUID handling, implemented securely and transparently. There are no indications of malicious intent, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities in this module.",
