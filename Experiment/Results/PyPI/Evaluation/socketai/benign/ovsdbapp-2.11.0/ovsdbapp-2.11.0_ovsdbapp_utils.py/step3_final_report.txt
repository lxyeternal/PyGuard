{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for IP normalization, UUID generation, validation, and extraction, intended for internal data processing within a larger system.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as IP address strings, port strings, UUID strings, and command objects containing UUIDs.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write to external systems, files, or network, nor does it execute external commands.",
  "flows": "Input data (IP strings, UUID strings) are processed through normalization, validation, and extraction functions, with exception handling for invalid formats.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns; the functions are straightforward. The only minor point is that 'normalize_ip_port' assumes port presence, but exceptions are handled properly.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard utility functions for IP address normalization, UUID creation, validation, and extraction. It employs proper exception handling and relies solely on standard libraries. No network activity, external command execution, or obfuscation is present. The functions are designed for safe data processing, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. The input validation is appropriate, and error handling is correct. The code is clear, well-structured, and free of suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performs standard utility functions, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements. The security risk is minimal, and the malware likelihood is zero. The scores assigned in the reports are justified and consistent with the code's characteristics.",
