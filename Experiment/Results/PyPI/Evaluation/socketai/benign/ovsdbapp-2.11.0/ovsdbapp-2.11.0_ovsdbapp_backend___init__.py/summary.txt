  "malware_score": 0.5,
  "security_risk": 0.45,
  "obfuscated": 0.4,

  "conclusion": "The code shows moderate malicious potential primarily due to eval() on untrusted data and obfuscation. The overall supply chain security risk is moderate, with no confirmed malicious payloads but patterns that warrant caution. Scores are adjusted to reflect these findings, emphasizing eval() suspicion and obfuscation as key indicators."
