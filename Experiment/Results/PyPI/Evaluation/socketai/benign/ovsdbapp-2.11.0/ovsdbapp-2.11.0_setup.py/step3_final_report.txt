  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for distribution, importing setuptools and ensuring compatibility with multiprocessing.",
  "sources": "Import statements for setuptools and multiprocessing, configuration parameters passed to setuptools.setup()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; configuration parameters are static and standard",
  "flows": "Initialization and setup call without dynamic or untrusted data flow",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for Python packages, including licensing comments, import attempts for compatibility, and a call to setuptools.setup() with fixed parameters. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data leaks. The code is static, well-documented, and follows standard practices. The minimal security risk score assigned in some reports (0.1) is acceptable but could be considered zero due to the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's characteristics.",
