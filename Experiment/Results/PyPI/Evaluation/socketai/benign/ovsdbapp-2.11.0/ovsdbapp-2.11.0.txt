The scores should reflect this assessment, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a low security risk score (~0.2) due to the use of threading and exception handling which are standard practices. The overall confidence in this conclusion is high."

The overall supply chain security risk is moderate, with no confirmed malicious payloads but patterns that warrant caution. Scores are adjusted to reflect these findings, emphasizing eval() suspicion and obfuscation as key indicators."
