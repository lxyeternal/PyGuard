  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured abstraction layer for OVSDB command and transaction management, with no malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities detected. Its purely interface-based nature results in a minimal security risk, and the scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
