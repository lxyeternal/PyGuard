  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the technical details, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the same minimal code: importing `pbr.version`, creating a `VersionInfo` object with `'ovsdbapp'`, and assigning its `version_string()` to `__version__`.\n- The code is a standard pattern for managing package versioning in Python projects.\n- There are no input sources, data sinks, or data processing; the code only retrieves static version info.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are present.\n- The reports' confidence levels are high, and the conclusions are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  **No.** The code is benign, straightforward, and uses a common versioning pattern.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- **Any errors or logical flaws?**  \n  **No.** The reasoning is sound; the code is simple and well-understood.\n\n### Score review:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`. This is appropriate; no malicious activity is detected or implied.\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All assign `0`. The code is clear and not obfuscated.\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  All assign very low (0 or 0.1). Given the benign nature, this is justified.\n\n### Justification for scores higher than 0.5:\n- None of the reports suggest any reason to assign higher scores. The code is a typical versioning pattern with no malicious or risky behavior.\n\n### Potential assumptions or claims:\n- The reports correctly avoid assumptions; they recognize the code as standard version management.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Risk score:** **0**\n\nThe code is a benign, standard version retrieval snippet with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, and the scores reflect that. No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
