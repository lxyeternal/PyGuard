  "purpose": "Define and assign the version string of the 'ovsdbapp' package using pbr's VersionInfo utility.",
  "sources": "Importing pbr.version, accessing VersionInfo('ovsdbapp') to get version_string",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sink points identified; purely reading static package version information",
  "flows": "Import pbr.version -> create VersionInfo object -> retrieve version_string",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of a known versioning library with no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code imports a well-known package (pbr) to manage versioning, then assigns a version string to __version__ using the library's VersionInfo class. No user input, network operations, or dangerous constructs are present. The license comments are standard boilerplate and do not influence code security.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical version declaration using the pbr library, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
