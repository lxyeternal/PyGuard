  "purpose": "This code retrieves the version string of the 'ovsdbapp' package using the pbr.version library and assigns it to __version__.",
  "sources": "Import of pbr.version and creation of VersionInfo object with 'ovsdbapp'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static version retrieval.",
  "flows": "Import -> VersionInfo creation -> version_string() -> __version__ assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation for managing package versioning, utilizing a standard library. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or contain any malicious patterns. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and very low security risk scores. The confidence levels are high, reflecting the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and poses no security threat. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
