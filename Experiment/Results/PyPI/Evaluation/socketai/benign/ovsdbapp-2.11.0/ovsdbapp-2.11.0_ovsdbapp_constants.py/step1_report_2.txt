  "purpose": "Define constants and configuration parameters for network and security policies related to Open vSwitch and networking.",
  "sources": "Constant variable assignments, configuration strings, and tuples defining policy types and network settings.",
  "sinks": "No actual data processing or untrusted data handling present; no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks; code only sets constants and configuration parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors detected. The code appears to be standard configuration setup.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable definitions, constants, and configuration values related to network settings and policy types. It includes IP addresses, port numbers, maximum values, and policy/action constants. There are no functions, input handling, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded credentials beyond standard local IPs, and no suspicious or malicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign configuration setup with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a straightforward declaration of constants used in network management or Open vSwitch configurations.",
