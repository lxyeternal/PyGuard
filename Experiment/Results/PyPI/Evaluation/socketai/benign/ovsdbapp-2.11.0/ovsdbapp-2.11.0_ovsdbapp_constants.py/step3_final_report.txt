{
  "purpose": "This code defines static configuration constants for network connections, policies, and protocols used in a larger system, serving as a configuration module.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string literals and numeric constants representing IP addresses, ports, timeouts, and policy/action types.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static constants with no data flow or external input handling.",
  "flows": "None; the code is purely declarative with no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code contains straightforward constant definitions with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static constants and configuration parameters with no executable logic, input handling, or dynamic behavior. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The constants are typical for network configuration and policy definitions. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the benign, static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly assess its safety, and the scores are justified. No adjustments are necessary.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
