  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as static configuration constants with no dynamic or input processing.\n- No external dependencies, no data flows, no suspicious or malicious code.\n- All scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are 0, which aligns with the description.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, indicating high certainty.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Critical Evaluation:\n\n**Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n- The code is purely static constants; no issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present.\n- No code logic, no data processing, no input handling, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n\n**Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n- They correctly identify the code as benign configuration constants.\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- Malware score: all 0, justified given the benign nature.\n- Obfuscated score: all 0, correct as the code is straightforward.\n- Security risk: all 0, appropriate since no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are identified.\n\n**Potential for Higher Risk Scores:**\n- Since there's no malicious or suspicious activity, increasing scores would be unjustified.\n- The code's purpose is purely declarative, serving as configuration constants.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:**\n- Confirmed as 0 across all reports, justified.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:**\n- Confirmed as 0, justified.\n\n**Risk Score:**\n- Confirmed as 0, justified.\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n- No hidden behaviors, no obfuscation, no suspicious constructs.\n- The code is a typical constants module, common in network management systems.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the reports' conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a benign, static configuration module with no security concerns. No adjustments to scores are necessary.",
