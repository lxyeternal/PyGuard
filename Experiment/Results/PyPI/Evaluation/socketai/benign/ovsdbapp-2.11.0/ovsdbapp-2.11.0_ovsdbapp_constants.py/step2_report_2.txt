  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a static configuration/constants module.\n- No dynamic code, input handling, or external data processing is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0, which seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code matches the descriptions: purely constants, no vulnerabilities, no malicious code.\n- No errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports' logic or reasoning.\n- The reasoning in all reports is consistent and justified.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- **SecurityRisk:** All reports assign 0, justified given the static nature and lack of vulnerabilities.\n\n### Potential concerns:\n- The code includes default IP addresses and port numbers (e.g., '127.0.0.1:6640'), but these are standard defaults and not inherently risky.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present.\n- No dynamic or executable code that could be exploited.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code is purely declarative, with no runtime logic, no vulnerabilities, and no malicious intent, the scores of 0 are appropriate.\n- Any higher score would be unjustified unless additional context (like embedded secrets or malicious code) was present.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The reports are accurate, and their scoring is reasonable.\n- The code is benign, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward constants module with no malicious or risky elements. The reports are correct in their assessments, and the scoring is appropriate. No adjustments needed.",
