  "purpose": "Define constants and configuration parameters for network device management and policy enforcement.",
  "sources": "Constants are hardcoded; no external data sources or input reading present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data output.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only sets constants and fixed string values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code appears to be configuration constants only.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes various configuration parameters, such as default connection strings, timeouts, maximum lengths, policy priorities, QoS settings, NAT types, and routing policies. All values are hardcoded and straightforward, with no dynamic or user-input processing, no external dependencies or data handling. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The code appears to serve as a static configuration module without any obfuscated or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of static configuration constants for network management, with no malicious intent, no malicious code, and no security risks. It is purely declarative and does not perform any operations that could be exploited or malicious.",
