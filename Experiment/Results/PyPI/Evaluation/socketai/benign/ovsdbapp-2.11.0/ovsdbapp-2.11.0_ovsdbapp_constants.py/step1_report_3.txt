{
  "purpose": "Defines constants and default configurations for network and security policies related to Open vSwitch and network functions.",
  "sources": "No input data sources are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present; no data flows are indicated.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are evident as the code only defines constants and strings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hidden code, or unusual behaviors are present. All variables are straightforward constants and string literals. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of variable assignments for configuration constants related to network policies, connection defaults, and maximum value limits. It does not include any input handling, external data processing, or executable logic. The constants are standard and well-documented. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code appears to serve as a configuration or constants module for larger network management software.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration module defining constants and default values for network security policies and connections. There are no indications of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks within this code snippet.",
