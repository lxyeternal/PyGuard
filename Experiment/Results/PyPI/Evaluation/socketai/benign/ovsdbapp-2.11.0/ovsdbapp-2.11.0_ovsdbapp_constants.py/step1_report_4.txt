  "purpose": "Define constants and configuration parameters for network management, specifically related to Open vSwitch and network policies.",
  "sources": "Constants for connection strings, timeouts, maximum lengths, policy priorities, NAT types, actions, protocols, and routes.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no data is being processed from external sources or leading to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this code only defines static constants without dynamic data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only constant definitions, configuration parameters, and fixed string values related to network configurations. No input reading, data processing, or external data flows are evident. There are no hardcoded credentials, no code injection points, or malicious behaviors. It appears to be a standard configuration file or constants module intended for a larger system.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a configuration or constants definition for a network management system. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior is detected.",
