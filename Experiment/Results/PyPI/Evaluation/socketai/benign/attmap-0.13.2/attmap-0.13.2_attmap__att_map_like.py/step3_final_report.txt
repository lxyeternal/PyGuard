{
  "purpose": "Defines an abstract base class for multi-access data objects supporting key-value operations, serialization, and customization hooks.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters, add_entries method, internal data structures, external helper functions (get_data_lines, is_custom_map).",
  "sinks": "Serialization methods output YAML and string representations; no external system or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into internal structures via add_entries; data is retrieved or serialized through various methods; no external untrusted data flows into system or network.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Minor stylistic issue with Python 2 style metaclass declaration, but not security relevant.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, abstract data container class with methods for data addition, serialization, and representation. It uses standard modules and patterns, with external helpers assumed benign. No network, file, or system commands are present. The data flow is internal and controlled. The class is designed for extension, with abstract methods and hooks. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard abstract data container with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or high security risk. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) is appropriate given its functionality. No modifications are necessary.",
