{
  "purpose": "Provides ancillary utility functions for data representation, logging, and object handling.",
  "sources": "Function parameters such as 'data', 'fun_key', 'fun_val', and 'key'.",
  "sinks": "Formatting functions (e.g., get_data_lines), logger creation, and message formatting.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through formatting and processing functions, with no untrusted data being sent externally or executed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for copying objects, formatting nested data structures into strings, logging, and safe deletion messaging. It uses standard library modules and practices without invoking external commands or handling untrusted input in a dangerous way. The get_data_lines function processes nested mappings for representation but does not execute code or handle untrusted input dangerously. The logger setup is standard. Overall, no malicious behavior or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module with no signs of malicious activity. It primarily handles data formatting, logging, and safe messaging without external communication, code execution, or data leakage mechanisms.",
