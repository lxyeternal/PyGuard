  "purpose": "Utility functions for data handling, logging, copying objects, and generating safe messages.",
  "sources": "Reading data from mappings, environment variables, or input parameters; no external untrusted sources.",
  "sinks": "String formatting in safedel_message; no data leaks or external communication points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through functions like get_data_lines and safedel_message, with no external or unsafe operations.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic assignment of a copy method to objects is unconventional but benign; no obfuscation or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions that perform data rendering, copying, logging setup, and message formatting. It uses standard library modules and practices. No external system calls, network activity, or handling of untrusted data that could lead to security issues are present. The dynamic assignment of a copy method is unusual but not malicious. String formatting is safe. The functions do not contain any suspicious or malicious logic, backdoors, or obfuscation. The malware score is justified as 0, obfuscated as 0, and the security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of benign utility functions with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
