  "purpose": "Provides ancillary utility functions for data handling, logging, and object manipulation in Python projects.",
  "sources": "Reads from sys.version_info, imported modules, and parameters passed to functions (data, fun_key, fun_val, key).",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks for untrusted data that could cause harm; primarily logs, string formatting, and data structure manipulations.",
  "flows": "Data is processed via functions like get_data_lines which transform data into text; no untrusted data flow leading to sensitive operations or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Use of nested copy function attached dynamically to objects; no apparent security concern. The code appears standard with no suspicious behavior or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and provides utility functions: copying objects via deepcopy, formatting nested data structures into text, creating loggers with null handlers, identifying custom mappings, and generating log messages for deletions. No code injections, network activity, or malicious data leaks are present. The dynamic assignment of copy method is benign and common in utility code. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are detected. The overall code is straightforward and appears safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of utility functions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or insecure practices. The use of dynamic method assignment and logging is standard practice. The overall security risk is minimal.",
