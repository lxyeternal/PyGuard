{
  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for data representation, logging setup, and object handling, including safe data copying and mapping checks.",
  "sources": "Input data is read via function parameters (e.g., 'data' in get_data_lines, 'obj' in is_custom_map, 'key' in safedel_message). No external data sources are directly accessed in the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include formatting strings (e.g., in safedel_message), logging functions (via get_logger), and deepcopy operations (in copy). No untrusted data handling is explicitly performed or propagated to external systems.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through get_data_lines for rendering, possibly invoking user-defined functions fun_key and fun_val; data can be deep-copied via copy; logging setup produces a null handler; safedel_message generates static messages.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns. The code contains standard utility functions without obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or hidden behaviors. The copy function redefines copying behavior but is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code provides common utility functions: get_data_lines for formatted nested data display, get_logger for safe logging, is_custom_map to identify non-dict mappings, safedel_message for logging key deletion attempts, and copy for deep copying objects. All functions perform standard operations without any network activity, dynamic code execution, or suspicious side effects. No hardcoded secrets, malicious data leaks, or backdoors are present. The use of deepcopy is safe here, and the logging setup is non-intrusive. The code appears to be benign, intended solely for utility purposes in larger projects.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a set of utility functions with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is well-structured, uses standard practices, and does not contain any anomalies suggestive of sabotage or malware.",
