{
  "purpose": "Provides ancillary utility functions for data handling, logging, and object manipulation, primarily for processing nested mappings and logging activities.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, collections, and standard libraries; no external input sources are explicitly used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output directly to external systems observed.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows identified; functions operate on passed parameters without external input manipulation or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "The 'copy' function defines a nested 'copy' method which replaces or adds a 'copy' method to an object, which is unconventional but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are present. No obfuscated code or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code contains utility functions for data rendering, deep copying, logging setup, and mapping type checks. The get_data_lines function recursively generates string representations of nested mappings, which is standard. The copy function uses deepcopy and attaches a method dynamically, which is unusual but harmless. get_logger sets up a logger with a NullHandler, a common practice to avoid logging issues. is_custom_map checks for non-dict mappings, and safedel_message generates a standard message. No signs of malware, data exfiltration, or malicious logic are present. The code appears straightforward and intended for utility purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code with no malicious intent. It performs standard data rendering, logging, and type checking functions. There are no signs of malware, suspicious behaviors, or security risks within this module.",
