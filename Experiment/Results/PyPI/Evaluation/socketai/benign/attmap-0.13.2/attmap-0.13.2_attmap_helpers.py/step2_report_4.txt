  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Purpose: Utility functions for data handling, logging, object manipulation.  \n- Findings: No suspicious behavior, code injection, or malicious patterns. Dynamic assignment of `copy` method is benign.  \n- Malware score: 0  \n- Security risk: 0.2 (slightly above zero, but justified given the dynamic method assignment, though it's standard in utility code).  \n- Confidence: 0.9  \n**Assessment:** The code is benign, and the low risk score is reasonable. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Purpose: Utility functions for data handling, copying, logging, safe deletion messaging.  \n- Findings: No malicious behavior, no external system calls, no data leaks.  \n- Noted that `safedel_message` uses string formatting, but it's safe here.  \n- Malware score: 0  \n- Security risk: 0.1 (very low).  \n- Confidence: 0.95  \n**Assessment:** The code is standard utility code, with no malicious intent. The low scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Purpose: Data representation, logging, object handling.  \n- Findings: No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.  \n- Uses standard practices.  \n- Malware score: 0  \n- Security risk: 0.1  \n- Confidence: 1.  \n**Assessment:** The code is safe and benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Purpose: Utility functions for data rendering, copying, logging, mapping checks.  \n- Findings: No malicious behavior, no external communication, no obfuscation.  \n- The dynamic `copy` method is unusual but harmless.  \n- Malware score: 0  \n- Security risk: 0.1  \n- Confidence: 0.95  \n**Assessment:** The code is benign, with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Purpose: Similar utility functions.  \n- Findings: No malicious behavior, no network activity, no obfuscation.  \n- Uses standard library functions safely.  \n- Malware score: 0  \n- Security risk: 0.1  \n- Confidence: 1.  \n**Assessment:** The code is safe.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, which aligns with the code's nature as utility functions.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Zero across all reports; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2), justified by the dynamic method assignment, but overall very low.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (consistent with the reports, slightly elevated due to dynamic method assignment but not concerning)  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign set of utility functions with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reported scores are reasonable and consistent with the code analysis.",
