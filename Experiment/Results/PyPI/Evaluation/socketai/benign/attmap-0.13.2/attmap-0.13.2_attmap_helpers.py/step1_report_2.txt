{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for data handling, logging, and data structure inspection, including copying objects, rendering nested data as text, and logging.",
  "sources": "Imports standard libraries (logging, sys, copy, collections), and data passed into functions such as 'data' in get_data_lines, 'obj' in copy, and 'key' in safedel_message.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe usage of format strings in safedel_message, but it only constructs a string; no direct sink for untrusted data is present. No external network or system calls are made.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., data in get_data_lines) flows through rendering functions, and logging functions are prepared but not invoked within this code. The copy function assigns deepcopy to an object method but does not invoke it here.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, backdoors, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code are detected. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present. The only string formatting in safedel_message is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions for data processing and logging. The copy function adds a deepcopy method to objects, get_data_lines creates nested text representations of data structures, get_logger provides a logger with NullHandler, is_custom_map distinguishes mapping types, and safedel_message generates a deletion message. All functions use standard library features in conventional ways. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage. The code appears safe and standard for utility purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of benign utility functions with no indicators of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It functions as expected for data handling and logging tasks without introducing security vulnerabilities.",
