{
  "purpose": "Provides a class AttMap that converts nested mappings into attribute-accessible objects, enabling attribute traversal and comparison.",
  "sources": "Internal data stored in self.__dict__, data passed into __setitem__, _metamorph_maplike, and _final_for_store methods.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; data flows internally within class methods, with no network, file, or system interactions.",
  "flows": "Data is set via __setitem__, transformed in _final_for_store and _metamorph_maplike, stored in __dict__, and retrieved via __getitem__.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, no external system calls.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard utility for nested mapping conversion with attribute access, equality comparison, and safe data handling. It uses standard Python practices, handles specific data types like numpy.ndarray and pandas.Series/DataFrame with appropriate comparison logic, and manipulates internal data via __dict__. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The use of del self.__dict__[key] in __delitem__ is typical for custom dict-like classes. The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or dynamic code execution. The logging is for debugging purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility class for nested mapping handling with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are accurate and appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
