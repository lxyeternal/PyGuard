  "purpose": "Assign a version string to the __version__ variable in a Python package.",
  "sources": "No input sources; static assignment in code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or external interactions.",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version assignment with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple assignment of a version string to __version__, a common practice in Python packages. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no input, data flow, or malicious behavior. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), as the code is minimal and standard. No evidence suggests malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious or security concerns. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
