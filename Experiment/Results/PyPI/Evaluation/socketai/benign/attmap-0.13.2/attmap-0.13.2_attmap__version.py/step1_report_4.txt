  "purpose": "Defines the version of the package or module.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs.",

  "flows": "No data flow since only a version string is assigned.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a version string to a variable named __version__. It is a common practice in Python packages to specify version numbers. There are no sources of untrusted input, no sinks for data leakage, and no flow of data from sources to sinks. The code is minimal and appears standard.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is benign, serving as a version identifier. It does not contain malware or security risks.",
