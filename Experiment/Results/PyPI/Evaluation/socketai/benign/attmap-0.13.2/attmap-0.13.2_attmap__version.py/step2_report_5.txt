  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code only assigns a version string to the `__version__` variable.\n   - There are no inputs, data flows, or external interactions.\n   - The code is straightforward and adheres to common Python packaging practices.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Anomalies:**\n   - No suspicious code patterns, secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic are identified.\n   - The code is minimal and standard, with no indication of malware or malicious intent.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n   - The security risk score is 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The confidence level is 1 across all reports, indicating high certainty.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - Since all reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments, no score adjustments are necessary.\n   - The code snippet is very simple; even considering obfuscation, there's no reason to suspect hidden malicious behavior.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores reflect this appropriately.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my evaluation:**\n\n- The code is a standard version string assignment.\n- No changes needed to the reported scores.\n- The overall risk and malware scores should remain at 0.\n- The confidence remains at 1, as all evidence supports a benign assessment.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\nMaintain the current scores: **malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0**.",
