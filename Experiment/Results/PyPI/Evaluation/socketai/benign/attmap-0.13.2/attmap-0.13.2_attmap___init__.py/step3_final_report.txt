  "purpose": "Defines and exports package-scope classes, imports internal modules, and sets up alias mappings for the package.",
  "sources": "Internal module imports, including wildcard imports from attmap_echo and helpers.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; import statements are static.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('from .attmap_echo import *', 'from .helpers import *') which can obscure dependencies but are common in package init files.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package initialization script, importing internal modules and setting up exports and aliases. No dynamic code, network activity, or data leaks are present. Wildcard imports are noted but are typical in such files and do not indicate malicious intent. The malware score is 0, as there is no evidence of malicious behavior. The risk score is very low (around 0.1-0.2), primarily due to wildcard imports, which are a minor concern but not inherently malicious. Confidence in this assessment is high (above 0.8).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for a Python package's __init__.py, with no malicious activity or security risks detected. Wildcard imports are a minor concern but do not constitute malicious behavior.",
