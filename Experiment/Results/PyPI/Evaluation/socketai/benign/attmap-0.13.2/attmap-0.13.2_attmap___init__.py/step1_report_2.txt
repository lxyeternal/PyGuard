  "purpose": "Define package exports, imports, and aliases for various data structure classes and helper functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (_att_map_like, _version, attmap, attmap_echo, helpers, ordattmap, pathex_attmap), and the code itself for defining __all__ and __aliases__.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no untrusted input handling, network operations, or data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flows or untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('from .attmap_echo import *' and 'from .helpers import *') can obscure actual dependencies and introduce potential hidden behaviors or unintended code execution, but this is a common practice in package __init__ files and not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly sets up module-level exports and aliases for various classes and functions. It imports internal modules and defines __all__ and __aliases__ for package exports. No data input, network operations, or runtime behaviors are present. The wildcard imports ('import *') could hide potentially malicious or unintended code, but in the context of a package initialization file, this is a standard pattern. No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation is detected. Overall, the code appears to serve as an organizational bootstrap for the package, with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily organizational, defining exports and aliases for the package. No malicious behaviors, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident. The use of wildcard imports warrants cautious review in the broader package context but is not inherently malicious here.",
