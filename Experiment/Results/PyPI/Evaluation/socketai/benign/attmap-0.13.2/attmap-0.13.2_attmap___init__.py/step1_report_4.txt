  "purpose": "Define and export package-level attributes and imports for module initialization.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules, and list of exported symbols (__all__) and aliases (__aliases__).",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data sources, no external data or inputs are read in this code.",
  "flows": "N/A – this code is primarily about defining package exports and aliases, not data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual patterns; only standard package attribute definitions and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several internal modules and defines package attributes and aliases. It does not include any dynamic code execution, user input handling, network activity, or external data sources. The structure is consistent with typical Python package initialization files. No hardcoded credentials or malicious patterns are present. The use of wildcard imports (from .attmap_echo import *, from .helpers import *) is a potential concern in terms of namespace pollution, but not indicative of malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to be straightforward package setup code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initialization script defining imports, exports, and aliases without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
