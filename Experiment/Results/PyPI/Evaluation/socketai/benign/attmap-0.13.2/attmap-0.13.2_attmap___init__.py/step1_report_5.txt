  "purpose": "Define and export package-level classes, functions, and aliases for a Python package related to attribute mapping.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules, package attributes, and `get_data_lines` from unspecified sources.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no data handling, network, or untrusted input processing occurs in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows identified; module mainly sets up class references and aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. The wildcard import (`from .attmap_echo import *` and `from .helpers import *`) could be considered less explicit, but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages module imports, class aliasing, and defines `__all__` for exports. The wildcard imports could obscure the full list of imported symbols but do not suggest malicious intent. The use of `__aliases__` appears to be for internal alias management. No data input, network activity, or dynamic execution is present. There are no signs of obfuscation or malware. The code structure is standard for Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a typical package initialization file that sets up classes, functions, and aliases for use elsewhere. No malicious or security-related issues are detected in this code.",
