{
  "purpose": "The code defines and exports various classes and functions related to attribute mapping, including alias mappings.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (_att_map_like, _version, attmap, attmap_echo, helpers, ordattmap, pathex_attmap), and a function get_data_lines.",
  "sinks": "The only potential sink is the get_data_lines function, which could process external data if used elsewhere, but not directly in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Imports and module-level definitions do not involve data flow from untrusted sources within this fragment; the get_data_lines function, if invoked elsewhere, could be a flow point.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('from .attmap_echo import *' and 'from .helpers import *') which can hide imported elements and potentially introduce unexpected or malicious code if the imported modules are compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, class and variable definitions, and export configurations (__all__, __aliases__). The wildcard imports are suspicious because they obscure which functions or classes are included, possibly hiding malicious or unintended code. However, within this fragment, no direct malicious actions or secret behaviors are evident. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns are present. The presence of __version__ and get_data_lines suggests version tracking and data processing, but without their definitions, no malicious intent can be inferred from this snippet. Overall, the code appears to serve as a module setup with no clear malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code primarily establishes module exports and aliases with some potentially risky wildcard imports. No explicit malicious code or behaviors are present in this snippet. The main concern is the use of wildcard imports, which can conceal malicious or unintended code imported from other modules. Overall, low suspicion based on this fragment alone.",
