  "purpose": "An AttMap subclass providing fallback behavior for attribute access, returning the key or default when the attribute is unset, with handling for protected attributes.",
  "sources": "Attribute access via __getattr__, internal method _is_od_member, class instantiation.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, network, or file operations.",
  "flows": "Attribute name flows into __getattr__, which may return default or attribute name itself; no external or system flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "Use of _is_od_member without provided implementation; fallback returning attribute name itself could be misused but is standard for such utility classes.",
  "analysis": "The code extends a base class to provide fallback attribute retrieval, handling protected attributes by raising AttributeError. It attempts to call the superclass's __getattr__, and if that fails, it checks if the attribute appears protected or is an 'od member'. If so, it raises an error; otherwise, it returns the default or the attribute name itself. The logic is straightforward, with no external data leaks, malicious code, or obfuscation. The reliance on an internal method _is_od_member is benign if internal, but its implementation is not shown. Returning the attribute name as a fallback is a common pattern but could be misused if attribute names are maliciously crafted. Overall, the code is a benign utility with minimal security implications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, straightforward utility class for fallback attribute access, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
