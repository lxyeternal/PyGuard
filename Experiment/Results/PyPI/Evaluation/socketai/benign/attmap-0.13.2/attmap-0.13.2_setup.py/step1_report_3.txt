{
  "purpose": "The script is used for packaging and distributing a Python project named 'attmap', including reading dependencies and version info, and setting up package metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from files: 'requirements/requirements-all.txt', '_version.py', and 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "The data from files is used to set package dependencies, version, and long description; no untrusted data sinks or external network operations are present.",
  "flows": "File contents (dependencies, version, long description) flow into setup configuration parameters, which are then used to configure the package setup process.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code segments detected. The code follows standard packaging procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code reads dependencies from a file, extracts version info from '_version.py', and reads a markdown file for the long description. It then uses setuptools.setup() to package the project. No external network calls, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The use of standard libraries and common packaging practices indicates benign intent. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or malicious code injection detected.",
  "conclusion": "This script appears to be a standard setup script for Python packaging with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It performs expected operations for packaging a Python project without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
