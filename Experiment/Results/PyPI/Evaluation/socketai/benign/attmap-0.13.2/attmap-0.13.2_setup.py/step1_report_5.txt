  "purpose": "This script configures the setup and installation parameters for the Python package 'attmap', including dependencies, versioning, and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads version from '_version.py', dependencies from 'requirements' files, and long description from 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling; no code injection or execution of untrusted code found.",
  "flows": "Reads version and dependencies files, then uses this data in setup(). No flow of untrusted input to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "None observed; code follows standard setup.py practices without obfuscated patterns or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script reads version info from a file and dependencies from requirements files, then uses setuptools.setup() to configure the package. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no external data is processed in an insecure manner. The code structure is straightforward and typical for a setup script, with no signs of malicious modifications or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal, benign setup script for packaging a Python project. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
