{
  "purpose": "This script is designed to set up and configure a Python package named 'attmap' for distribution, including reading dependencies, version info, and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading version from a version file, reading dependencies from requirements files, reading README.md for long description, reading sys.argv for conditional setup dependencies.",
  "sinks": "Potentially passing untrusted data into the setup() function, especially dependencies and version strings, which could influence package behavior.",
  "flows": "Version and dependencies are read from files and passed into setup(), which is executed with all collected metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of dynamic string formatting is standard for setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup procedures for a Python package, including reading dependencies and version info from files, then calling setuptools.setup(). The code appears straightforward and conventional for package configuration. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network access, data exfiltration, or backdoors. No obfuscated or unusual language features are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It reads configuration data from local files and executes package setup accordingly. There is no evidence of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
