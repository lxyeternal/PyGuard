{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for a Python package named 'attmap', used to define package metadata, dependencies, and installation parameters.",
  "sources": "Reading dependencies from 'requirements/requirements-all.txt', reading version from 'attmap/_version.py', reading long description from 'README.md', and analyzing command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data input from requirements files, version file, and command-line arguments that could influence setup behavior.",
  "flows": "Reading dependencies and version info (sources) influence setup parameters (sinks).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code reads files for configuration without executing untrusted code or performing network operations. No obfuscated or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script reads dependency lists from specified requirements files, extracts version information from a version file, and reads the long description from a markdown file. It then configures package setup parameters, including dependencies, metadata, classifiers, and test requirements. The dynamic inclusion of 'pytest-runner' based on command-line arguments is standard practice. No signs of malicious code, such as hidden network activity, code injection, or backdoors, are evident. All data sources are local files or controlled inputs. The code structure follows typical setup.py conventions with no suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily reads configuration data and sets up package parameters without executing untrusted code or performing insecure operations.",
