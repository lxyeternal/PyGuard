  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It is a standard `setup.py` script for a Python package called `attmap`.\n- Reads dependencies from `requirements/requirements-all.txt`.\n- Reads version info from `attmap/_version.py`.\n- Reads long description from `README.md`.\n- Configures package metadata, classifiers, and optional dependencies.\n- Conditionally adds `pytest-runner` if certain command-line arguments are present.\n- No code execution, network activity, or obfuscated code observed.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  No, all reports agree that the code is standard, with no malicious or suspicious activity.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- **Any errors or flaws?**  \n  No. The code follows typical patterns for a `setup.py`. No logic errors or security flaws are evident.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`. This is appropriate given the absence of malicious code.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  All reports assign very low or zero, e.g., 0.1 or 0. This is reasonable, as the script is standard.\n\n### Specific points:\n- The **security risk** is minimal; the code reads local files and passes data into `setup()`. No untrusted data execution or network activity.\n- The **dependency on command-line arguments** for optional dependencies is standard and not suspicious.\n- No signs of code injection, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- **Claims about potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n  All reports correctly identify that the script reads from local files and does not execute untrusted code or perform network operations.\n\n- **Any inconsistencies?**  \n  No. All assessments are consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (minimal, due to dependency on external files, but standard practice)\n\n### My overall estimate:\nGiven the thorough review and the consensus, I agree with the reports' conclusions. The code is a typical, benign setup script with no security issues.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis setup script is safe and standard for Python packaging.",
