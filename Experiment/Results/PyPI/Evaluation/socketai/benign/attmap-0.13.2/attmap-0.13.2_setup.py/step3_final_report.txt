{
  "purpose": "This code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project named 'attmap'. It reads dependencies, version info, and description from local files, then configures package metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads dependencies from 'requirements/requirements-all.txt', version from 'attmap/_version.py', and description from 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network activity or code execution occurs.",
  "flows": "Reads local files (requirements, version, README) and passes data into setuptools.setup() without executing untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "Uses a common pattern to parse version string which assumes a specific format; potential fragility but not malicious. No obfuscation or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py for Python packaging, performing file reads and passing data to setuptools. No code injection, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. The dependency on local files is standard, and the conditional inclusion of 'pytest-runner' based on sys.argv is common practice. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious or security issues. The scores are appropriate, and there is no evidence of supply chain attack or sabotage.",
