{
  "purpose": "The script is used to configure the package setup for distribution, including reading dependencies and version info.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from a file, reads long description from README.md, reads dependencies from requirements files, and gathers setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is written or executed in an unsafe manner.",
  "flows": "Reads version and description files, processes dependencies, and passes parameters to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles package setup: it reads version info from a file within the package directory, loads dependencies from requirement files, and reads the project README. It then calls setuptools.setup() with these parameters. There are no dynamic code executions, no network operations, or hidden behaviors. Usage of the 'sys.argv' for conditional dependencies is standard. The code's structure and logic are typical for a Python package setup script and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This script appears to be a standard setup configuration for a Python package without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It is a typical setup script with no signs of malware, backdoors, or security issues.",
