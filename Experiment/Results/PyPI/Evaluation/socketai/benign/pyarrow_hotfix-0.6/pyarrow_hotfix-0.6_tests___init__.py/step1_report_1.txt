  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink pathways are evident; this is purely metadata in comment form.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of only license comment with no executable code; no anomalies or suspicious activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is only a license metadata comment, which does not execute or process data. It provides licensing information for the source code, including copyright and SPDX license identifiers. Since it contains no executable or imported code, there are no security concerns or malicious behavior. No sources, sinks, or data flows are present beyond the comment itself.",
  "conclusion": "The file contains only a license comment with no executable code, making it highly unlikely to contain malware or security risks. No anomalies or malicious behavior are detected.",
