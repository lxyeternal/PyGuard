{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite verifying the installation, uninstallation, and behavior of a pyarrow hotfix, involving reading local IPC and Parquet files and asserting correct behavior.",
  "sources": "Local files 'data.arrow' and 'data.pq' read via pyarrow functions, and internal hotfix management functions.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network activity, or data exfiltration; operations are confined to local file reads and assertions.",
  "flows": "Source data (local files) are read and processed within the test functions; no external data flows or untrusted inputs lead to external effects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected; code is straightforward and standard for testing.",
  "analysis": "The code performs local file reads, hotfix installation/uninstallation, and assertions to verify behavior. It uses standard testing practices with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or external communication. The logic is clear, and the purpose is solely to test internal library features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured test suite for pyarrow hotfix functionality, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
