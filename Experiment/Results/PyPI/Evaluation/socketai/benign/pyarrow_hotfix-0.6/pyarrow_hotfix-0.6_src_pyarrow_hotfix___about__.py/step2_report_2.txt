  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and analyze whether the conclusions are justified based on the code and the report's reasoning.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe minimal, static code that declares metadata: SPDX license identifiers, copyright notices, and a version string.\n- No input handling, data processing, external calls, or dynamic behavior are present.\n- The code appears to be standard boilerplate for open-source package metadata.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Assessment:** No issues, benign.\n- **Score justification:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, security risk is 0.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. The reasoning is sound.\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, standard metadata.\n- **Scores:** All zero, consistent.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Assessment:** Again, standard static metadata.\n- **Scores:** Zero across all categories.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, benign.\n- **Scores:** Zero.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion, standard license and version declaration.\n- **Scores:** Zero.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis:**\n\n- **Code presence:** Confirmed. The code is just variable assignments and comments.\n- **Malware risk:** None detected; all reports agree.\n- **Obfuscation:** None; code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** None; no dynamic behavior or external interactions.\n\n**Any discrepancies?**  \nNo. All reports are consistent and justified in their assessments.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0 across all reports, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should be 0, given the straightforward nature.\n- **Risk score:** Should be 0, as there's no security concern.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The code is standard package metadata, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**Final estimate:**\n\n| malware | obfuscated | securityRisk |\n|---------|--------------|--------------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0            |\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and reasoning provided.",
