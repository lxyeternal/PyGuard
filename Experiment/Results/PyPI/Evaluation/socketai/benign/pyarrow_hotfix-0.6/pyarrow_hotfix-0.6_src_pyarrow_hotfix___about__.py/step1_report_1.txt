  "flows": "None; static metadata assignments with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious patterns; only standard metadata comments and variable assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a SPDX license identifier, copyright notice, and a version variable assignment. These are typical for license compliance and package metadata. No input handling, no data processing, and no code execution are present. The code is minimal and standard for package documentation. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard license and version metadata with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves to declare license and version info and contains no harmful or suspicious behavior.",
