  "purpose": "Declare metadata including copyright and license information, and specify the package version.",
  "sources": "Constants such as the SPDX copyright and license comments, and the __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data input or output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows identified; static metadata declarations only.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of SPDX license identifiers and version string is standard for open-source packages; no suspicious or unusual code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments for licensing and copyright, along with a straightforward version string assignment. No runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions are present. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security concerns. This is typical metadata found in open-source package files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves only as metadata for the package. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
