  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "Import statements are static; no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and a license comment, indicating a benign setup snippet. No dynamic behavior, data processing, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is present. All reports correctly identify the code as harmless, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign import snippet with no malicious or security concerns. The current scores are appropriate and justified.",
