  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content Verification:**\n   - All reports describe code that consists solely of import statements from the `cvat_sdk` package and a license comment.\n   - The original code snippet confirms this: no functions, no data processing, no network activity, no user input handling.\n   - **Conclusion:** No issues or malicious behavior are present in the code itself.\n\n2. **Logical Flaws or Mistakes in Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent, detailed, and correctly identify that the code is benign.\n   - They accurately note the absence of suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or data flow.\n   - No logical flaws are evident in the analysis.\n\n3. **Scores Review:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Suggestion:** No changes needed; scores are reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports assign zero risk, no justification for higher scores is necessary.\n   - The code is purely import statements with no malicious or risky behavior.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - Correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n   - No malicious activity is detected or implied.\n\n6. **Challenging Assumptions:**\n   - The reports assume the code is benign based on static import statements.\n   - This is reasonable; no assumptions about hidden malicious behavior are warranted here.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis provided.\n   - No discrepancies observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### Overall Expert Judgment:\n\nGiven the nature of the code, I agree with the reports' assessments. The code is standard, benign import statements from a known SDK, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, and the current scores accurately reflect its benign nature.",
