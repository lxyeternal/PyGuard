  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is solely composed of import statements from the `cvat_sdk` package and a license comment.\n   - No dynamic code execution, data processing, network activity, or handling of untrusted data is present.\n   - The code is a typical setup snippet, likely used for initializing or configuring a client for the CVAT platform.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues:**\n   - None of the reports identify any anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n   - The code appears benign and standard for SDK importation.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Confidence: 1 (high confidence in their assessment)\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Malware: 0\n     - SecurityRisk: 0\n   - These scores are consistent with the analysis that the code is harmless.\n\n4. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Risks:**\n   - Since the code only imports modules and assigns a version string, there are no vulnerabilities or attack vectors present.\n   - The reports correctly dismiss any concerns about malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n\n5. **Malware and Obfuscation Scores:**\n   - Malware score: 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - Obfuscated: 0, consistent with straightforward import statements.\n\n6. **Risk Score Justification:**\n   - The overall risk score is 0, which is justified because:\n     - There is no malicious activity.\n     - No data flow from untrusted sources.\n     - No suspicious or obfuscated code.\n   - No reason to increase the risk score.\n\n7. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the code as standard SDK import statements.\n\n8. **Consistency & Final Estimation:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - Given the code snippet's simplicity and benign nature, the scores are appropriate.\n\n**Final Expert Assessment:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward, benign import snippet with no security risks, malicious intent, or obfuscation. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
