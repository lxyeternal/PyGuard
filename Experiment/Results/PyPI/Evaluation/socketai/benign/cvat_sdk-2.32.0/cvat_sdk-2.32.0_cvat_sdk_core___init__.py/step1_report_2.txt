  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; merely imports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports three components: Client, Config, make_client from cvat_sdk.core.client and VERSION as __version__ from cvat_sdk.version. It includes a license comment. The code is straightforward and does not perform any actions or data processing. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present. It is standard import code for a Python SDK module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import and version assignment with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign part of a larger SDK package.",
