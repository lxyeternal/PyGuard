  "purpose": "Importing classes and functions from the cvat_sdk library for client configuration and versioning.",
  "sources": "Imports from cvat_sdk.core.client and cvat_sdk.version modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no handling of untrusted data or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow is present in the provided code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears to be standard library imports with licensing comments.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only licensing comments and straightforward imports from a known SDK package. There are no signs of code injection, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors. The imports are from open-source SDK modules related to a CVAT AI platform, which are generally safe. No suspicious code structure, obfuscated code, or unintended behaviors are present. The purpose seems to be setting up a client for CVAT with no hidden or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign import snippet from the cvat_sdk library with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
