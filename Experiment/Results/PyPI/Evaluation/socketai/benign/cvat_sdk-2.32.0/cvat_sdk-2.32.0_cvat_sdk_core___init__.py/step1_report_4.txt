{
  "purpose": "Importing modules and functions from the 'cvat_sdk' package, likely for initializing or configuring a client connection to a CVAT server.",
  "sources": "Import statements accessing 'cvat_sdk.core.client' and 'cvat_sdk.version' modules.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs that process untrusted input; no network or sensitive data operations are present.",
  "flows": "N/A - No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only imports modules and variables.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from a well-known SDK package. It imports 'Client', 'Config', 'make_client' from the SDK's 'core.client' module, and a version string. There are no dynamic code executions, data processing, or network operations. The license comment indicates open-source licensing. The imports suggest subsequent use of SDK functions but do not exhibit malicious intent in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard import setup for using the CVAT SDK. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks in this fragment.",
