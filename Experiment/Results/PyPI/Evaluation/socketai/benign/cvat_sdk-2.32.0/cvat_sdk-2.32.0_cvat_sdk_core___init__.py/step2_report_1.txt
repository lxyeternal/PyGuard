  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the original code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is purely import statements from the `cvat_sdk` package, with no data processing, network activity, or dynamic behavior.\n   - The code is straightforward, benign, and typical for SDK setup.\n   - **Conclusion:** No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious code are present in the code snippet.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and thorough, correctly identifying that the code is benign.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n   - The assessments correctly note the absence of suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The current risk scores are all 0, which aligns with the benign assessment.\n   - Since there's no malicious activity, no reason to increase the risk score.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign `malware`: 0.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No suspicious claims are made; the reports are cautious and accurate.\n   - They correctly interpret the code as a standard import snippet.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable ratings are observed.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a simple, benign import snippet.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Personal Estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Final note:** The reports are accurate, and the code poses no security concern.",
