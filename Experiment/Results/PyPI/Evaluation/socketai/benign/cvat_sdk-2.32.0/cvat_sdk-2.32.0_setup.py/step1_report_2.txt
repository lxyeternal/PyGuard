{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup procedures for packaging and installing the 'cvat_sdk' Python library, including version parsing, requirement parsing, and metadata specification.",
  "sources": "Reading version from 'version.py', reading requirements from 'requirements/base.txt', reading README.md for long description, and package discovery via 'find_packages'.",
  "sinks": "The file reading functions are benign, mainly reading static files. No data is being written or sent externally. No user input or untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks.",
  "flows": "Static file content (version, requirements, long description) are read and processed locally during setup; no external data flow or untrusted input processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The version extraction regex appears standard. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup operations: reading version info from a local file, parsing requirements, and configuring package metadata. The functions include normal file I/O operations with no network activity, code injection, or malicious behavior. The regex for version parsing is straightforward and well-defined. Requirement parsing supports inclusion of other requirement files via -r flags, a common practice. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are evident. No user input or untrusted data sources are processed, and no external connections or data exfiltration is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It reads static files and prepares package metadata. Overall security risk is negligible, with very low confidence of malicious activity.",
