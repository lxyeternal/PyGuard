  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Summary:** The script performs standard setup procedures: reading version info, parsing requirements, and package metadata. No suspicious or malicious activity is detected.  \n- **Assessment:** The logic is straightforward, and the code operates only on local static files. The regex for version extraction is standard. No external data or network activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, Risk = 0.0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Fully benign.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard practices, no anomalies, and local file reads.  \n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious intent, no obfuscation, no external data flow.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, Risk = 0.0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Safe and typical setup script.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Summary:** Again, standard setup with local file reads, no suspicious patterns.  \n- **Assessment:** No dynamic code execution, no external data, no obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, Risk = 0.0.  \n- **Conclusion:** No security concerns.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Summary:** Same pattern—local file reads, no anomalies, standard practices.  \n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious behavior, no obfuscation, no external communication.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, Risk = 0.0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard setup code, no suspicious activity.  \n- **Assessment:** No external data, no obfuscation, no malicious patterns.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, Risk = 0.0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** All reports agree that the code is a typical setup script for a Python package, operating solely on local files with no suspicious or malicious activity detected.\n- **Malware Score:** Consistently 0 across all reports. No evidence of malicious behavior such as code injection, dynamic execution, or network activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as the code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports indicate negligible risk, consistent with the code's nature.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\nGiven the thorough analysis and consensus, I concur with the assessments. The code is a standard, benign setup script with no security issues.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0.0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** **0.0** (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, non-obfuscated, and carries no security risks.",
