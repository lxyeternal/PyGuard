{
  "purpose": "The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging the 'cvat_sdk' library, handling version extraction, requirements parsing, and package metadata configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'version.py', requirements from 'requirements/base.txt', and long description from 'README.md'. All file operations are local and static.",
  "sinks": "None; the script does not process untrusted input or produce external outputs beyond package metadata.",
  "flows": "Reads static files and uses regex to extract version; no external data flow or dynamic code execution occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code follows typical packaging conventions with straightforward file reads and regex parsing.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup tasks: reading version info with regex, parsing requirements with support for recursive includes, and configuring package metadata. It does not perform network activity, dynamic code execution, or handle untrusted data. The regex for version extraction is safe and standard. All file operations are on local, static files. No obfuscation or malicious code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports correctly identify its safe nature. The overall security risk is negligible.",
