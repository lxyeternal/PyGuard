{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up and configure a Python package named 'cvat_sdk', including version parsing, requirement parsing, and package metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from 'version.py' for version information, 'requirements/base.txt' for dependencies, and 'README.md' for the long description.",
  "sinks": "Data from files is used directly for package setup; no untrusted data input or external data transmission is evident. No sinks that could leak data or execute untrusted code are present.",
  "flows": "The version string is extracted from 'version.py' and used in package metadata; requirements are parsed from text files for dependencies. No data flows from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. The code is standard setup script for a Python package, with straightforward file reading and regex matching.",
  "analysis": "The script reads static files ('version.py', 'requirements/base.txt', 'README.md') to gather information for package setup. The 'find_version' function extracts version info via regex, which is a typical pattern. The 'parse_requirements' function recursively processes requirement files, avoiding common issues like circular includes. All actions are read-only and do not involve external data input or untrusted sources. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code structure aligns with standard Python packaging practices, with no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It reads static files for configuration and metadata, with no dangerous or suspicious activities. The likelihood of malware or security issues is very low.",
