{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for a Python package, specifically 'cvat_sdk', handling version extraction, dependencies parsing, and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from 'version.py', reads requirements from 'requirements/base.txt', and reads long description from 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; all file reads are from local, controlled files within the package repository.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from 'version.py' → uses regex to extract version → reads dependencies from local requirement files → uses local files for package setup info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present. No external data inputs or outputs that could be exploited are used beyond standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup and packaging tasks: reading local files for version, requirements, and description, then passing this info to setuptools.setup(). The version extraction uses regex on a local file, which is a common and safe practice. Dependency parsing handles recursive includes via '-r' directives, which is standard. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious operations are present. All file access is confined to local, predictable files. No hardcoded credentials or potentially malicious code snippets are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a typical, benign setup configuration file for a Python package. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident. It safely manages package metadata and dependencies using local files, with no signs of sabotage or obfuscation.",
