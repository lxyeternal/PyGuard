{
  "purpose": "This script sets up and configures the Python package 'cvat_sdk' for distribution, including version extraction, requirements parsing, and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads 'version.py' to extract version string; reads 'requirements/base.txt' to parse dependencies; reads 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "Open files for reading; potentially reading untrusted input files (though they are local and static). No network, database, or environment variable use observed.",
  "flows": "Reads version information from local 'version.py' -> uses it in setup; reads requirements from local text files -> used during package installation; reads long description from 'README.md' -> used in package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code detected. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious imports. Use of 're.match' on static content is safe. No network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup procedures: locating version info, parsing dependencies, and configuring package metadata. File operations are limited to local files. No external data inputs or untrusted data sources are involved. No suspicious or malicious logic identified. All steps are typical for a Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate setup configuration for a Python package without any malicious intent. It reads local files to gather package metadata and dependencies, and there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
