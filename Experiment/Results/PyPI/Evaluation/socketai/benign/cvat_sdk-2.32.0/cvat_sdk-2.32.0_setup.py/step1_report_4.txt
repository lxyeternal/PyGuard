{
  "purpose": "This script is designed to set up and configure the 'cvat_sdk' Python package, including version extraction, dependency parsing, and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading version from 'version.py', reading requirements from 'requirements/base.txt', and reading long description from 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "None of the data read sources are used insecurely; no untrusted data is written or sent over the network.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks. The code reads static files and processes their content locally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior detected. The code uses standard practices for package setup, with straightforward file operations and regex parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup operations: locating and reading files for versioning, dependencies, and documentation. The version extraction uses regex on a local file, which is safe, and dependencies are parsed from local requirement files. No untrusted data inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. The code structure adheres to common Python packaging patterns, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration file for a Python package. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. All operations are limited to local file reading and parsing, with no network communication or dynamic code execution. Based on the provided code, the package appears safe and free from malware.",
