  "purpose": "Assign a version string to a variable, indicating the package version.",
  "sources": "No input sources; static assignment within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no external data or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or source-to-sink paths present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a straightforward version string assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a variable assignment: VERSION = \"2.32.0\". It contains no input, external interactions, obfuscation, or malicious constructs. All reports correctly identify the benign and minimal nature of this code. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No suspicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues are present. The code is a standard pattern for defining package version information.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward version string declaration with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
