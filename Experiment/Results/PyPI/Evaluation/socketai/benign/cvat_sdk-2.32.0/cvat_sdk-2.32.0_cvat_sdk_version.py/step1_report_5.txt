  "purpose": "The code appears to define a version string for a software package or module.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data leaks or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow beyond the assignment is present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, just a version string assignment; no anomalies or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a version string assignment, which is standard practice for package versioning. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. It lacks any input handling, function definitions, or operations that could be exploited. Given the simplicity, there are no anomalous or malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only as a version identifier with no malicious intent or security risks.",
