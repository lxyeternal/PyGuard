  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SDK error handling related to the CVAT.ai platform.",
  "sources": "None; no input or data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or output points present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths since the code only defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code consists solely of exception class definitions without suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports no external modules, defines three custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, and includes only docstrings. No code execution, data input, or potentially malicious constructs are present. The structure appears standard for Python exception definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign set of class definitions for exception handling. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are detected.",
