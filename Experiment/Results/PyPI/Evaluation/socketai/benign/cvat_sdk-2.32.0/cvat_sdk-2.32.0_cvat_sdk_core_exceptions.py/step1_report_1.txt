  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the CVAT SDK to handle specific error conditions.",
  "sources": "No input or external data is read by this code.",
  "sinks": "No data outputs or external communications are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink since the code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to be standard class definitions for exceptions; no suspicious or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class. The classes are intended for handling specific error scenarios within the CVAT SDK, such as invalid hostnames and version mismatches. There are no hardcoded credentials, network operations, or other suspicious constructs. The code is straightforward, clean, and typical for Python SDKs, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely consists of exception class definitions used for error handling within an SDK. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks present in this fragment.",
