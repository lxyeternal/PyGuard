  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code solely defines custom exception classes inheriting from Python's built-in Exception.\n   - There are no indications of data processing, network activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no anomalies or suspicious constructs.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is benign and typical for SDK error handling.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - Security risk scores are also 0, aligning with the absence of vulnerabilities.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1, reflecting certainty.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports consistently find no malicious or risky behavior, there is no justification for higher risk scores.\n   - The code is purely structural, defining exception classes without any dynamic or external interactions.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is justified.\n   - No malicious activity, code injection, or obfuscation is present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are based on straightforward observations; no assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities.\n   - The reports correctly avoid speculative conclusions.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - The high confidence levels are justified.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, non-malicious set of exception class definitions.\n- No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward class definitions)\n- **Risk:** 0 (benign, standard error handling code)\n\n**Final conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No further action is necessary.",
