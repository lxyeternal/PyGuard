  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code only defines custom exception classes inheriting from Python's built-in `Exception`.\n   - No issues such as malicious code, data handling, network activity, or obfuscation are present.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no dynamic behavior or external dependencies.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they uniformly state that the code is benign and standard.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - The assessments correctly note the absence of suspicious activity.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1, which is justified.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely defining exception classes with no malicious or risky behavior, a risk score higher than 0.0 is unwarranted.\n   - The reports' zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is correctly set to 0 in all reports, as there's no malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they only describe what the code does.\n   - They do not speculate beyond the evidence.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's content.\n   - The uniformity across reports indicates consensus.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\nGiven the analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is standard, benign, and poses no security risk.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward, well-structured set of custom exception classes.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n**Final malware score:** 0  \n**Final obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Final risk score:** 0\n\nThis component is safe and does not introduce any security concerns.",
