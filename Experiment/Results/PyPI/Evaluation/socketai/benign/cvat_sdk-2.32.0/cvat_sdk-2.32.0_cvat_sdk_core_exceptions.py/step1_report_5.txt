{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the CVAT SDK to handle specific error cases",
  "sources": "No input sources; the code only defines classes and comments",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or external data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only establishes exception class hierarchy",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions and comments",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple class definitions inheriting from Exception, with descriptive docstrings. There are no inputs, outputs, or data processing. No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, and no external network or system interactions are present. The code is standard exception class declarations, typical for error handling in Python libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exceptions for a SDK, with no signs of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It appears to be a benign and conventional component of a larger project.",
