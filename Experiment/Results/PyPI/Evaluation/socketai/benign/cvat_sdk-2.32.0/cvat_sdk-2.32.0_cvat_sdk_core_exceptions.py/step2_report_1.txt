  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports agree that the code only contains straightforward class definitions for custom exceptions. There are no signs of malicious code, data handling, or obfuscation. The code is standard for SDK error handling.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no suspicious behavior, data flows, or external interactions. No logical flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code clarity and simplicity.  \n   - **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no malicious activity.  \n   - **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since the code is purely class definitions for exceptions, there's no basis for a higher risk score. The code does not perform any operations that could introduce security vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The code does not include any suspicious or malicious constructs such as code injection, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code. The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions and correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**  \n   The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Overall conclusion:\n\nThe code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions with no security issues. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Note:** Always ensure that the surrounding code or integration points are similarly scrutinized, but based solely on this fragment, the assessment stands.",
