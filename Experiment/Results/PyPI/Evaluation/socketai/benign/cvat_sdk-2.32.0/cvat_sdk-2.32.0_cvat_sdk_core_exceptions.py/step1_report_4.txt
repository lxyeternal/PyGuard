  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for the CVAT.ai SDK to handle specific error cases.",
  "sources": "No input reading or data ingestion present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data output or untrusted data handling present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks as no runtime data processing exists.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears straightforward with standard exception class definitions; no unusual constructs or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class. It includes only docstrings and inheritance without any dynamic execution, data handling, or network activity. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears to serve as a part of a larger SDK framework and contains no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, standard definition of custom exception classes with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears benign and solely serves error handling purposes.",
