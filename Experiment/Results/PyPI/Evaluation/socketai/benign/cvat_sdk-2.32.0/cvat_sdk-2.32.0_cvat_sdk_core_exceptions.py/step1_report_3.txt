  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SDK error handling in the CVAT AI SDK",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; class definitions do not read data",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or data leaks present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only defines exception classes",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward class inheritance with comments",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes inheriting from Python's Exception class. It includes descriptive docstrings and a license comment. There are no dynamic code executions, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. The classes serve as structured exception types for SDK errors, which is standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, well-structured definition of exception classes with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
