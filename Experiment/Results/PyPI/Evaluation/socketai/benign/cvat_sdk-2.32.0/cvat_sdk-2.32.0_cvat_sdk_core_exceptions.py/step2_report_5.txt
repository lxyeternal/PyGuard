  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior**:\n   - The code only defines three custom exception classes inheriting from Python's built-in `Exception`.\n   - Each class has a descriptive docstring explaining its purpose.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, network operations, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.\n   - The code appears to be a standard, straightforward implementation of error handling classes within an SDK.\n\n2. **Assessment of Malicious Activity and Security Risks**:\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign, with no anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's content.\n   - No evidence of obfuscation or malicious intent is detected.\n   - The code's purpose is solely to facilitate structured error handling, a common practice.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: Correctly set to 0; no malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: Correctly set to 0; code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk Score**: All reports assign a 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n4. **Potential Flaws or Errors in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No adjustments needed based on the provided information.\n\n5. **Overall Conclusion**:\n   - The code is a standard, harmless component of an SDK.\n   - The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.\n   - No further action or suspicion is warranted.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:\n- Maintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.\n- No changes necessary.\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is a typical, non-malicious implementation of custom exception classes for error handling in an SDK. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scoring reflects that accurately.",
