  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code only defines three custom exception classes inheriting from Python's `Exception`.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, network operations, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The code is straightforward, with descriptive docstrings and license comments.\n   - No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior & Security Risks:**\n   - All reports consistently indicate no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n   - The code serves as part of an SDK's error handling mechanism, which is standard practice.\n\n3. **Scores & Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign a 0, which aligns with the absence of security risks.\n\n4. **Potential Flaws or Misjudgments:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; no adjustments needed.\n   - The reasoning is sound, emphasizing the benign and standard nature of the code.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- The code is a minimal, standard implementation of custom exception classes for error handling.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security risk factors are present.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and reasonable.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — clear, straightforward class definitions.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security vulnerabilities or risks evident.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, with no security concerns. The scores are justified and should remain as they are.",
