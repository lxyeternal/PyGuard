  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SDK error handling, including invalid host and version mismatch errors.",
  "sources": "Class definitions for CvatSdkException, InvalidHostException, and IncompatibleVersionException",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external interactions; purely class definitions",
  "flows": "Instantiation of exception classes during error handling; no data flow or external data processing",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class inheritance with descriptive docstrings",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from Python's Exception, serving as custom error types. There are no data inputs, outputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The code is clear, well-structured, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs. The purpose is standard for SDK error handling. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no security issues or malicious intent. The scores are justified and should remain as assigned.",
