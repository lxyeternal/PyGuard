  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements from the `cvat_sdk` library, specifically importing exception classes.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The comments mention licensing and suppress linter warnings, which is standard practice.\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1 and a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Specific analysis:**\n\n**1. Report 1:**\n- The reasoning is sound; the code only imports exception classes.\n- No data flows, sinks, or anomalies.\n- The conclusion that the code is benign is accurate.\n- Malware score: 0, security risk: 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**2. Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, with consistent reasoning.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n- Malware score: 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**3. Report 3:**\n- Again, the code is straightforward import statements.\n- No signs of malicious intent.\n- Malware score: 0, security risk: 0.\n\n**4. Report 4:**\n- Same conclusion; standard import statements.\n- No suspicious patterns.\n- Malware score: 0.\n\n**5. Report 5:**\n- Consistent with previous assessments.\n- No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- Malware score: 0.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code snippets are benign, standard import statements for exception handling.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.5 or less) are reasonable.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. The code is purely for importing exception classes, with no security concerns.",
