  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements of exception classes from the cvat_sdk library.\n- No reports identify any dynamic code execution, data processing, network activity, or suspicious patterns.\n- The code snippets are straightforward, with clear licensing comments and no obfuscation.\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1 and malware/security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the described benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Logical Consistency:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  Yes. The code matches the description: static import statements with no malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports?**  \n  No. The reasoning is consistent, and the conclusion that the code is benign is justified.\n\n- **Scores assigned?**  \n  The scores seem appropriate:  \n  - Malware: 0 (no malicious activity)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (no obfuscation)  \n  - Security Risk: 0 (no evident vulnerabilities or malicious intent)  \n  - Confidence: 1 (clear and straightforward code)  \n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \n  No. The reports do not assume vulnerabilities; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The code only imports exception classes; it does not process data or perform any actions.\n- There is no indication of malicious intent, backdoors, or malware.\n- The consistent pattern across all reports supports the conclusion that this is standard SDK setup code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Overall, I agree with the reports' assessments.**  \nThe code is benign, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed reasoning above. The code is a typical import block with no security concerns.",
