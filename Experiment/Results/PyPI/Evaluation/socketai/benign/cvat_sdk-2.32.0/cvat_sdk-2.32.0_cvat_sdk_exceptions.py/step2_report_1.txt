  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements of exception classes from the cvat_sdk library.\n- No dynamic code execution, data processing, or external communication is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The purpose across all reports is consistent: setting up error handling in a larger application.\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1, with malware and security risk scores at 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n**Confirmations and potential issues:**\n- The code snippets are straightforward import statements, matching the original code provided.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration, is present.\n- The licensing comments are standard and do not raise concerns.\n- No anomalies or unusual behaviors are observed.\n\n**Scores and their appropriateness:**\n- Malware score: 0 across all reports is appropriate; no malicious activity is evident.\n- Obfuscated score: 0 is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- Security risk score: 0 is justified given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Potential improvements:**\n- The reports could mention that these imports are typical for error handling in SDK-based applications and emphasize that the code alone is not executable or vulnerable.\n- Since all reports are consistent, no score adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate.\n- The reports are accurate and thorough.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard, harmless import setup for exception handling. No further action or concern is warranted.",
