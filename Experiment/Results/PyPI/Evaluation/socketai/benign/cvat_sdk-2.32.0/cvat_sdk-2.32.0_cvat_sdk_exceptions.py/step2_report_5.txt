  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements of exception classes from the `cvat_sdk` library.\n- The code snippets contain no dynamic execution, data processing, network activity, or handling of untrusted data.\n- The comments and import statements are standard, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- Malware scores are consistently 0, aligning with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code is straightforward and matches the description. No issues or malicious code are present.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report:**\n   - The reports are accurate and logical. They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no suspicious behavior.\n   - No errors or flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to issues:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Security risk scores are also 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign high risk scores, and given the code's simplicity, this is justified.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The malware scores are all 0, which is correct since there's no malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as harmless.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature and the analysis provided.\n\n**My overall assessment:**\n- The code is benign, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.\n- The malware score should remain 0.\n- The obfuscated score should remain 0.\n- The security risk score should remain 0.\n- The overall risk score should be minimal, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- The current scores are appropriate.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is a standard, safe import statement with no security concerns.",
