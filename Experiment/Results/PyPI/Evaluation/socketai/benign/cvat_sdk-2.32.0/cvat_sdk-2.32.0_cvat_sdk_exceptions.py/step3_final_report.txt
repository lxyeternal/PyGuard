  "purpose": "Import exception classes from the cvat_sdk library for error handling in a larger application.",
  "sources": "Import statements reading exception classes from cvat_sdk.exceptions modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; code does not process data or communicate externally.",
  "flows": "N/A; only static import statements without data flow or execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import statements, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for exception classes, with licensing comments and linter suppression. No dynamic code, network activity, data processing, or suspicious patterns are present. The purpose is standard error handling setup. The code is simple, clear, and aligns with typical SDK usage. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard import setup for exception handling, with no malicious intent or security concerns. All reports correctly identify this, and the scores are justified.",
