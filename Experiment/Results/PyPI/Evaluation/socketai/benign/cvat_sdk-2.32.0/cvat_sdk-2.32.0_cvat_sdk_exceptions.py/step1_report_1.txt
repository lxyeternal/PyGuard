{
  "purpose": "The code imports exception classes from the cvat_sdk package, likely for handling errors related to the CVAT.ai SDK.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the cvat_sdk library, specifically exceptions modules",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no data processing or output actions present",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths; only static imports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; straightforward import statements with clear licensing comments",
  "analysis": "The code imports several exception classes from the cvat_sdk modules, which are used for error handling. The comments indicate license info and suppress linter warnings for unused imports. There is no evidence of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code appears to be a typical setup for exception handling in a larger application.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving only to import exception classes for later use in error handling within a CVAT SDK-based application. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected.",
