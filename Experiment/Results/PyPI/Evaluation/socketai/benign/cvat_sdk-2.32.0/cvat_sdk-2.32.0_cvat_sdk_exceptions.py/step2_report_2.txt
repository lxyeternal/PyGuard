  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the associated code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code consists solely of import statements for exception classes from the `cvat_sdk` package.\n   - No dynamic code, data processing, network activity, or other potentially malicious operations are present.\n   - All reports correctly identify that this code is benign and standard for setting up error handling.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly interpret the purpose of the code.\n   - No logical flaws or misconceptions are evident.\n   - The reasoning that this code is harmless and purely for exception handling is sound.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (or 1.0), which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n     - `obfuscated`: 0, which is correct.\n     - `malware`: 0, aligning with the benign assessment.\n     - `securityRisk`: 0, which is reasonable.\n   - No adjustments needed; the scores seem appropriate.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The highest risk here is `malware`, which is 0.\n   - Since the code is only import statements with no malicious activity, a high risk score is unjustified.\n   - The reports' low risk scores are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n   - No malicious intent or behavior is indicated or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No discrepancies or inconsistencies are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation and Personal Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward and clear.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risk present.\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a simple, standard import of exception classes from a known SDK, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The reports are accurate, and their scoring aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n**Overall, I concur with the reports' assessments.**",
