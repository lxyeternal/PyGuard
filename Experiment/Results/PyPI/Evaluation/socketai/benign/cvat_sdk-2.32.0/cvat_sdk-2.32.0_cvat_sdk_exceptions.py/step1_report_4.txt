  "purpose": "This code imports exception classes from the cvat_sdk library, likely to handle errors related to CVAT SDK functionalities.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'cvat_sdk.api_client.exceptions' and 'cvat_sdk.core.exceptions'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; purely import statements with no dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard import statements and licensing comments.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only licensing comments and import statements for exception classes from a third-party CVAT SDK. No input reading, no data processing, no execution of dynamic or untrusted code, and no suspicious patterns such as hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are present. All imports appear to be legitimate and related to error handling within the SDK.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of standard license and import statements. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
