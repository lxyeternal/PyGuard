  "purpose": "Utility function to encode a boolean mask into run-length encoding within a specified bounding box for image annotation purposes.",
  "sources": "bitmap array (boolean mask), bbox coordinates",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; operates solely on input data",
  "flows": "Input bitmap and bbox -> validate -> slice bitmap -> flatten -> compute run-lengths -> append bbox info",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code performs input validation on a boolean 2D array, slices the mask according to the bounding box, flattens it, and computes run-length encoding by detecting changes in pixel values. It then appends the bounding box coordinates to the output list. The implementation is standard, with no external system interactions, network calls, or dynamic code execution. It contains no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation. The validation ensures correct input types and bounds, preventing invalid data processing. Overall, the code is a benign utility for mask encoding with no security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard utility function for encoding masks with no malicious behavior or security risks. The scores are consistent with its benign nature, warranting a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and risk score of 0.",
