{
  "purpose": "Encode a boolean mask into a run-length encoding suitable for a labeled shape request, constrained within a bounding box.",
  "sources": "bitmap parameter (boolean array), bbox parameter (coordinate list)",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no data leaks or untrusted data effects evident",
  "flows": "Input parameters (bitmap and bbox) are processed to generate run-length encoding, with no external data or network interactions",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code performs a standard image mask encoding with input validation.",
  "analysis": "The code validates input dimensions and types, ensuring the bitmap is a 2D boolean array and the bbox coordinates are within image bounds. It calculates coordinate boundaries, extracts the relevant sub-mask, and performs run-length encoding. No external calls, network operations, or malicious activities are present. The logic is straightforward and aligns with common image processing routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility function for encoding image masks. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are identified. It operates solely on provided input data with proper validation.",
