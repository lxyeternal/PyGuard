  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of an import statement with a wildcard (`from cvat_sdk.api_client.models import *`) and a license comment.\n   - No actual malicious code, hardcoded secrets, network activity, or data flows are present.\n   - The code's purpose is to re-export symbols for SDK API exposure, which is a common pattern.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports consistently note the use of wildcard imports as a potential concern. While this is a valid coding practice warning, it is not inherently malicious or security-critical.\n   - No false positives or logical errors are evident in the reports.\n   - The assessments are aligned with standard security review practices for such code snippets.\n\n3. **Scores Review and Suggestions:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, which is correct.\n   - The security risk scores are generally low (around 0.1 to 0.2), which seems reasonable since the code is straightforward.\n   - Confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 to 1.0), reflecting the clarity of the code and the absence of suspicious behavior.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores (>0.5):**\n   - No issues warrant a higher risk score. The code is a simple import statement, standard in SDK modules.\n   - The only minor concern is the wildcard import, which can lead to namespace pollution but is not a security risk.\n\n5. **Malware and Obfuscated Scores:**\n   - All reports correctly assign malware = 0, consistent with the absence of malicious code.\n   - Obfuscated = 0 is also appropriate; no obfuscation techniques are used.\n\n6. **Challenging Assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly avoid assuming malicious intent solely based on the use of wildcard imports.\n   - They recognize that such imports are common in SDKs and do not indicate malicious activity.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis. The low security risk and malware scores reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard SDK re-export pattern with no malicious or security-critical issues.\n- The reports are thorough and accurate.\n- The minor concern about wildcard imports is noted but does not elevate the security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (appropriate, given the minimal concern about namespace pollution)\n- **Confidence:** High (around 0.9 to 1.0)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The use of wildcard import is a common pattern in SDKs, though not ideal from a code clarity perspective. No changes to the scores are necessary.",
