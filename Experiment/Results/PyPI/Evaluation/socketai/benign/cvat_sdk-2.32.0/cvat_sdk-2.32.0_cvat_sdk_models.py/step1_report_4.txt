  "purpose": "Reexport symbols for public SDK API to make them accessible through the module.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing all symbols from cvat_sdk.api_client.models",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data handling; no untrusted data processing or output",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths present in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*'), which can hide imported symbols and potentially introduce malicious or unintended code; no other anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of a license comment and a wildcard import statement. Wildcard imports can be problematic as they obscure which symbols are imported, potentially hiding malicious or unintended code. However, this alone does not indicate malicious intent. No other suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code is present. The license information and import are typical for SDK modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward SDK module setup with a wildcard import, which may be considered poor practice but does not inherently indicate malicious behavior. No evidence of malware or security risks is apparent from this snippet.",
