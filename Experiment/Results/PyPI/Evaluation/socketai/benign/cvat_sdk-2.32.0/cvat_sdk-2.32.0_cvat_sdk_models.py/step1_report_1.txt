  "purpose": "Reexport symbols from the cvat_sdk.api_client.models module for public SDK API access",
  "sources": "Import statement importing all symbols from cvat_sdk.api_client.models",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present in this code snippet",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from sources to sinks in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import which can obscure the source of symbols, but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports all symbols from a specific module, which is common in SDK packages for exposing APIs. There are no data inputs, outputs, or network activity. No malicious behavior or security issues detected. The only noteworthy aspect is the use of a wildcard import, which can lead to namespace pollution but is not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module re-export, with no signs of malicious behavior. No security risks identified. The use of wildcard import is a design choice but not inherently suspicious.",
