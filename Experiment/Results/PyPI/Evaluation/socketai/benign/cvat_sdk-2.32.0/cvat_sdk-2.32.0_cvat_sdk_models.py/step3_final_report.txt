  "flows": "None; static import without data flow or external communication",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import (*), which can obscure imported symbols and lead to namespace pollution",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward license comment followed by a wildcard import, common in SDK modules for convenience. No malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The wildcard import is a style concern rather than a security issue. All reports correctly identify the import pattern and assign malware and obfuscation scores of 0. The security risk scores are low (around 0.1 to 0.2), reflecting minimal concern. Confidence in the benign nature of the code is high (0.7 to 1.0). The main concern is the use of wildcard import, which could be improved for clarity but does not constitute a security vulnerability.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign SDK re-export pattern with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The primary issue is the use of wildcard import, which is a style issue rather than a security flaw. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
