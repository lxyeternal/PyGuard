  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of each report:**\n\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: a license comment followed by a wildcard import from `cvat_sdk.api_client.models`.\n- The purpose across reports is consistent: re-exporting symbols for SDK API exposure.\n- Common observations: no data sinks, no data flows, no network activity, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscated or suspicious code.\n- The main concern raised is the use of a wildcard import (`*`), which can obscure which symbols are imported and potentially lead to namespace pollution or hiding malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code is syntactically correct and typical for SDK modules.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** No vulnerabilities such as hardcoded secrets, code injection, or insecure data handling.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code; the import is straightforward.\n- **Use of wildcard import:** While discouraged, it is a common pattern in SDKs for convenience, not inherently malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:** The core code snippet does **not** contain malicious code or security flaws. The main issue is the use of wildcard import, which is a design choice rather than a security flaw.\n\n---\n\n### Reviewing scores:\n\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2; given the code's simplicity, this seems reasonable, though the use of wildcard import could be considered a minor risk (namespace pollution). The scores are consistent with the observations.\n- **Confidence:** High (0.7 to 1.0), reflecting the clear understanding that this is a benign SDK pattern.\n\n**Recommendation:** The scores are reasonable; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n\n- All scores are below 0.5, indicating low risk, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The small security risk (0.1-0.2) reflects the minor concern about wildcard import but does not elevate the overall risk.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n\n- **Wildcard import concern:** While not malicious, it can lead to namespace pollution, making maintenance and security auditing harder. However, this is a coding style issue, not a security flaw.\n- **Potential for malicious code:** None detected or implied.\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities:** No assumptions are made that go beyond the evidence; the reports correctly identify the import pattern as standard SDK practice.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malware detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 (low, due to wildcard import but no actual security risk)  \n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard SDK re-export pattern with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The use of wildcard import is a known pattern but not inherently malicious. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- No issues present beyond the stylistic concern of wildcard import.  \n- No malware or obfuscation.  \n- Security risk is minimal.  \n- The current scores are justified and should remain as-is.",
