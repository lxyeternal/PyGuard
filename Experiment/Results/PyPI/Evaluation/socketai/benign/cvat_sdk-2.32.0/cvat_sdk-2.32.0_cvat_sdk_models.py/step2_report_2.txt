  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and analyze the details step-by-step.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: a comment header, followed by a wildcard import from `cvat_sdk.api_client.models`.\n- The purpose across all reports is consistent: re-export symbols for public SDK API access.\n- No reports indicate any dynamic behavior, data flows, or external communications.\n- The main concern raised is the use of a wildcard import (`*`), which can obscure which symbols are imported and potentially lead to namespace pollution or unintended symbol exposure.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the presence of issues in the code:\n\n- **Code content:** The code is a straightforward import statement with a comment header. No malicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no network activity.\n- **Issue presence:** The only potential issue is the use of a wildcard import, which is a known bad practice but not inherently malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nNo actual security issues or malware are present. The code itself is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:\n\n- All reports correctly identify the wildcard import as a potential concern but rightly conclude that it is not malicious.\n- No report claims any malicious behavior or data leakage.\n- The analysis in each report is consistent with the code snippet.\n\n**Potential oversight:**  \nWhile the reports mention the wildcard import as a flaw, they do not explicitly recommend best practices (e.g., explicit imports). However, this is more of a style concern than a security flaw.\n\n**Overall:**  \nNo significant logical errors or flaws in the reports.\n\n---\n\n### Review of the scores assigned:\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk Score | Confidence |\n|---------|-----------|--------------|--------------|------------|\n| 1       | 0         | 0            | 0.1          | 0.9        |\n| 2       | 0         | 0            | 0            | 1.0        |\n| 3       | 0         | 0            | 0.1          | 0.9        |\n| 4       | 0         | 0            | 0.2          | 0.7        |\n| 5       | 0         | 0            | 0.1          | 0.9        |\n\n- The **malware scores** are all zero, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- The **obfuscated scores** are zero, consistent with no obfuscation.\n- The **risk scores** are low, mostly 0.1 or 0.2, reflecting minimal concern.\n\n**Are these scores reasonable?**  \nYes, they are consistent with the analysis. The slightly higher risk scores (0.2) in some reports acknowledge the wildcard import concern, but overall, the scores are appropriately low.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n\n- None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.2, which is appropriate.\n- Given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious indicators, higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n---\n\n### Malware score justification:\n\n- No malicious behavior detected; the code is a static import statement.\n- The malware score remains at 0, which is correct.\n\n---\n\n### Challenging claims based on assumptions:\n\n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions about malicious intent.\n- They correctly identify the wildcard import as a potential issue but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis provided.\n- No discrepancies observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores based on the review:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, mainly due to wildcard import practice)\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a benign SDK pattern with no security issues. The only concern is the use of a wildcard import, which is a style issue rather than a security risk.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary:**\n\n- **Issues present:** No, only a style concern with wildcard import.\n- **Errors/flaws in reports:** None significant; all reports are consistent.\n- **Scores:** Appropriate; no changes needed.\n- **Malware and obfuscated scores:** Correctly zero.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero due to import style, but still very low.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores; the code is safe, and the reports are accurate. For best practices, consider replacing the wildcard import with explicit symbol imports, but this does not impact security assessment.",
