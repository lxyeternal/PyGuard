  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code and context.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports focus on a simple import statement: `from cvat_sdk.api_client.models import *`.\n- The purpose across all reports is to re-export symbols for SDK API exposure.\n- No data sinks, network activity, or untrusted data handling are present.\n- The main concern is the use of wildcard import, which can obscure which symbols are imported and potentially introduce namespace pollution or unintended imports.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malware are observed in any report.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code\n- The code is a straightforward import statement with a comment and license header.\n- No evidence of malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic.\n- The wildcard import is a common pattern in SDKs but is generally discouraged due to namespace pollution.\n\n**Conclusion:** No malicious issues or security vulnerabilities are present.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes\n- The primary flaw is the use of `from ... import *`, which can lead to namespace pollution and obscure which symbols are imported.\n- This is a known best practice concern but not a security issue per se.\n- No logical errors or code malfunctions are evident.\n\n**Note:** The reports correctly identify the wildcard import as a potential concern but do not consider it malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Review the scores assigned\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **SecurityRisk:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2; given the benign nature, these seem reasonable but could be lowered further.\n- **Confidence:** Ranges from 0.7 to 1.0; high confidence that no malicious activity exists.\n- **Overall:** The scores seem consistent with the analysis, though the security risk scores could be slightly lowered to 0.0 or 0.05, considering the lack of actual security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5\n- Since no malicious activity, secrets, or vulnerabilities are present, risk scores should be minimal.\n- The minor concern is the wildcard import, which could lead to namespace pollution, but this is a coding style issue, not a security risk.\n- Therefore, **securityRisk** should be closer to 0.0.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities\n- The reports assume that the wildcard import could be problematic, but they do not suggest any malicious intent or actual security flaw.\n- No evidence supports that this import could be exploited or that it contains malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Consistency of scores\n- The scores are generally consistent with the analysis.\n- Malware scores are all zero, which is appropriate.\n- The confidence levels are high, reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Security risk score:** Should be lowered to **0.0** because no actual security risk exists.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.0 (due to the benign nature of the code, despite the wildcard import being a style concern)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a standard SDK re-export pattern with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The primary concern is the use of wildcard import, which is a style issue rather than a security issue. Therefore, the risk score should be adjusted downward to reflect the absence of actual security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports are thorough and mostly accurate; the only adjustment needed is lowering the security risk score to 0.0.",
