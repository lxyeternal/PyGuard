  "purpose": "Reexport symbols for the public SDK API from the cvat_sdk package",
  "sources": "The import statement from cvat_sdk.api_client.models",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data leaks or malicious actions are present",
  "flows": "The code imports models and makes them available for public use; no data flows to external systems or untrusted inputs",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a wildcard import which can obscure what is imported, but it is a common pattern for SDK modules; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious constructs are present",
  "analysis": "The code simply reexports symbols from a submodule of the cvat_sdk package. It includes a copyright notice and a SPDX license identifier. The wildcard import is typical for SDK API modules to expose all models for public use. No obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident. The code appears straightforward and intended for API convenience.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard SDK pattern to expose models for public API access. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
