  "purpose": "Re-export symbols from cvat_sdk.api_client.models for public SDK API usage",
  "sources": "Import statement importing all symbols from cvat_sdk.api_client.models",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow paths present, as this is an import statement only",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import (`*`) can obscure which symbols are imported, but this is common in SDKs for convenience; no explicit malicious behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code re-exports all symbols from a module within the SDK, which is a common practice. The import is static and does not execute any code or handle untrusted input. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or obfuscated code are present. The only concern might be the wildcard import, which can make the namespace less clear, but it does not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard SDK module re-export with no malicious behavior. It simply makes symbols available for external use. No security risks or malware indicators identified.",
