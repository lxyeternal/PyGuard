  "purpose": "Re-export symbols from a module for public SDK API access",
  "sources": "Import statement importing all symbols from cvat_sdk.api_client.models",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or external communications",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; this is a straightforward import",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import can obscure what symbols are exposed, but is common in SDKs; no signs of malicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports all symbols from a specific module in the cvat_sdk package. This is a common practice in SDKs to simplify API exposure. There are no hardcoded credentials, no network activity, and no unusual code structures. The comment indicates it is for re-exporting symbols for the public API, which aligns with standard SDK design. No evidence of malicious or suspicious activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple re-export statement used in SDKs, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
