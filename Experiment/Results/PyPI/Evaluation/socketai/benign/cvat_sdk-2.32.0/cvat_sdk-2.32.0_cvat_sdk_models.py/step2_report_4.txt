  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code: a license comment and a wildcard import from `cvat_sdk.api_client.models`.\n- No data sinks, network activity, or untrusted data flows are present.\n- The main concern raised is the use of a wildcard import (`*`), which can obscure the namespace and potentially hide malicious or unintended code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present:\n- The code itself is straightforward: a license comment and a wildcard import.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.\n- Wildcard import is common in SDKs for convenience but can lead to namespace pollution.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nNo malicious code, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities are present in this snippet. The only potential issue is the use of wildcard import, which is a known best practice concern but not a security risk per se.\n\n---\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n- All reports correctly identify the use of wildcard import as a concern but correctly conclude that it is not malicious.\n- No reports suggest any actual vulnerabilities, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n- Some reports assign a low security risk (around 0.1 to 0.2), which seems appropriate given the context.\n\n**Note:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They do not overstate the risk and acknowledge the limitations of the wildcard import.\n\n---\n\n### Score review and justification:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. There is no indication of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct; no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, which is reasonable given the context.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**\n- The risk scores could be slightly lowered to 0, as the only concern is coding style, not security.\n- The malware and obfuscated scores are correct at 0.\n\n---\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- The reports assume that wildcard imports are non-malicious, which is generally correct.  \n- No assumptions about hidden malicious code are justified here, as the code is static and straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores given are reasonable.\n- The main concern is the wildcard import, which could be flagged as a code quality issue rather than a security issue.\n- The risk scores could be lowered to 0, but given the conservative approach, keeping them at 0.1–0.2 is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minor concern due to wildcard import, but not security-related)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a simple, standard SDK re-export with no signs of malicious activity. The wildcard import is a known practice in SDKs but can be improved for clarity and maintainability. No security risks or malware are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nWhile the current scores are appropriate, if a more strict security posture is desired, the risk score could be set to 0, emphasizing that this is primarily a style and best practices concern rather than a security threat.",
