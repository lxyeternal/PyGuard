  "purpose": "Utility functions and classes for API pagination, progress reporting, stream management, and response validation within a Python SDK.",
  "sources": "HTTP responses (response.data), stream objects (io.RawIOBase), progress reporter instances, endpoint.call_with_http_info calls.",
  "sinks": "json.loads(response.data), stream.read(), stream.seek(), response.status checks.",
  "flows": "Response data is loaded into JSON or extended into result lists; stream read/seek updates progress; response status checked for validity.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecation warnings in progress reporter classes; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious external connections.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard API pagination, stream reading with progress updates, and response status checking. No malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The deprecation warnings are benign. The data flow is straightforward, with no suspicious external calls or data leaks. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to the benign nature of the utility functions and standard library usage. The malware score is correctly zero, as no malicious activity is evident. The obfuscated score is zero, reflecting clear code. The low security risk score (~0.1) is justified by the benign utility functions and minor deprecation warnings.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, standard, and free of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's benign nature. No modifications are necessary.",
