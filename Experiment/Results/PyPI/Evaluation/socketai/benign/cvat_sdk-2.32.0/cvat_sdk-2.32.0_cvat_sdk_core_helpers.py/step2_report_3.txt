  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues found; code is standard utility functions/classes.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No flaws or mistakes detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, security risk is low (0.1). These seem reasonable.\n- **Justification:** The code is straightforward, with no suspicious behaviors or malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate utility code.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues; standard pagination, progress, and stream handling.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No flaws detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, security risk is low (0.0–0). The deprecation warning is benign.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Utility code with no security concerns.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues; utility functions/classes.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No flaws.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, security risk is minimal (0.2). Slightly higher due to deprecation warnings, but not malicious.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious behavior; deprecation warnings are benign.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard utility code.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues; standard API pagination, progress, and stream handling.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No flaws.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, security risk low (0.2). No suspicious activity.\n- **Justification:** No malicious intent detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate utility code.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues; typical SDK utility functions.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No flaws.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, security risk low (0.1). Warnings and assertions are benign.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe and standard.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate 0, and the code contains no suspicious network activity, code injection, or malicious payloads.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Very low (mostly 0.1–0.2), consistent with utility code that performs network and stream operations without security concerns.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's content.\n- No changes are necessary; the code is safe and functions as intended.\n- The deprecation warnings and assertions are benign and typical for evolving SDKs.\n\n**My personal estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, standard utility code)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a safe, well-structured utility module for API pagination, progress reporting, and stream handling. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present.",
