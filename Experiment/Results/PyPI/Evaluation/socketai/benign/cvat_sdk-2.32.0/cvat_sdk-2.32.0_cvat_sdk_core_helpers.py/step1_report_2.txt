{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions and classes for handling paginated API responses, progress reporting, and stream management within the cvat_sdk for interacting with CVAT's API.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from HTTP responses (response.data), stream objects (stream.read, stream.seek), and progress reporter instances.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur if response data or stream contents are mishandled; however, there are no direct data exfiltration mechanisms present. No untrusted data is sent over the network or stored insecurely.",
  "flows": "Data flows from HTTP response objects into JSON parsing or result aggregation; streams are read and their progress is tracked; progress reporters update progress metrics based on data read.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a deprecation warning for using TqdmProgressReporter instead of DeferredTqdmProgressReporter, which suggests legacy code handling. No suspicious hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present. No unusual or malicious logic is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of paginated API data collection, progress reporting, and stream handling. The get_paginated_collection function iterates through API pages, appending results. Progress reporter classes manage tqdm progress bars, with a warning about deprecated usage. StreamWithProgress wraps a stream to track progress during read and seek operations. The expect_status function validates HTTP response status codes, raising exceptions for error codes. All code logic aligns with expected behavior for such utility functions, with no signs of malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of API pagination, progress reporting, and stream management, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It operates as expected within its utility scope and contains no malicious or suspicious constructs.",
