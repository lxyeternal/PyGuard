  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is utility functions/classes for API pagination, progress reporting, stream management. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1.0\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is standard, with no suspicious elements. The low security risk score aligns with the analysis. The malware score is appropriately zero.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report is accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar utility functions, with deprecation warnings, no malicious activity, standard logic.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The code is straightforward, and the deprecation warning is benign. The malware score is correctly zero.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues; the scoring is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for API pagination, progress, streams, with deprecation warnings, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** The slight increase in securityRisk (0.2) seems to account for deprecation warnings but no actual security flaw. Malware remains zero, which is justified.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard API pagination, progress, stream handling, no malicious activity, deprecation warnings.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.95\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the low risk, and malware is correctly scored as zero.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions, no malicious activity, standard code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1.0\n- **Assessment:** The low security risk score is appropriate, malware score is zero.\n\n**Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with the analysis. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, as expected.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low (0.1–0.2), reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n- **Confidence levels:** High (0.9–1.0), justified by the straightforward utility code.\n\n### Final recommendation:\n\n- The scores across all reports are reasonable and consistent with the detailed analysis.\n- No changes are necessary.\n- Given the nature of the code, I would assign an overall **malware score of 0.0**, **obfuscated score of 0.0**, and a **security risk score of approximately 0.1** to reflect minimal inherent risk.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** ~0.1 (low, primarily due to deprecation warnings and standard practices)\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms the code's safety and appropriateness for its intended utility functions.",
