{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions and classes for handling paginated API data retrieval, progress reporting, and stream management, primarily within the context of the CVAT SDK.",
  "sources": "Data is read from network responses via endpoint.call_with_http_info and from stream objects through the read() and seek() methods.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data from HTTP responses is processed and extended into results lists; streams are read and manipulated, but with no apparent insecure handling.",
  "flows": "HTTP response data flows from endpoint.call_with_http_info to JSON parsing or directly into result collections; stream data flows from stream.read() to progress updates.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated warnings for progress reporters; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious network activity observed; no obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be standard utility code for handling paginated API responses, progress reporting, and stream reading. It includes functions for retrieving all pages of API results, classes for progress reporting with tqdm, and stream wrapper classes that update progress during read and seek operations. The expect_status function validates HTTP responses, raising exceptions for unexpected statuses. There are no signs of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. Usage of warnings for deprecated features is benign. All data handling appears consistent with normal operation. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious external connections, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured utility module for API data handling and progress reporting within the CVAT SDK. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified. It does not exhibit any obfuscation, malicious network activity, or backdoors. The code is safe and intended for legitimate API interaction and user feedback purposes.",
