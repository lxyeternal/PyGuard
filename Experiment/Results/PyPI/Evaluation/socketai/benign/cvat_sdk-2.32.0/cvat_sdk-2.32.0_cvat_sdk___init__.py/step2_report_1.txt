  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Code Context:**\n\nThe code consists solely of import statements from the `cvat_sdk` package, along with a license identifier. There is no executable logic, data handling, network communication, or dynamic behavior in the snippet.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** Correctly identifies the code as benign, standard imports, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, benign import statements, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Also notes only import statements, no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—standard imports, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Slightly more cautious, assigns a `securityRisk` of 0.1, confidence 0.9.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The code snippet does not justify a security risk of 0.1. It only contains benign import statements. The license header and imports are standard. The minimal security risk score here seems unjustified unless there's context suggesting that the imported SDK could be malicious, which isn't indicated.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security Risk:** Most reports assign 0, except report 5, which assigns 0.1. Given the code snippet, this is unwarranted.\n- **Confidence:** High confidence (1) in all reports, which is appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Issues & Recommendations:**\n\n- The **securityRisk** score in report 5 should be **0**, as there's no evidence of risk in this code fragment.\n- No report suggests any suspicious or malicious behavior, nor obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Summary & My Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Clear, straightforward import statements.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security concern in this code snippet.\n\nThe reports are consistent with the actual code. The only adjustment needed is for report 5's `securityRisk` score, which should be **0**.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\n- The code is benign, standard SDK import statements.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behavior is present.\n- The scores across all reports are appropriate, with the exception of report 5's minor security risk score, which should be revised downward to 0.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n\n- **malware:** 0\n- **obfuscated:** 0\n- **securityRisk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and best security practices.",
