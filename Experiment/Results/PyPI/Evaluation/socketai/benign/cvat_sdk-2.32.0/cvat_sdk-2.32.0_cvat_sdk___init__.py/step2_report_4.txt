  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the evidence for malicious activity, obfuscation, and overall security risk.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is purely import statements from a legitimate SDK, with no dynamic code, data processing, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues. The high confidence (1) aligns with the benign nature.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, only import statements from a trusted library, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues. The confidence is 1, consistent with benign code.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, only imports, no runtime logic or data handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious activity.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Again, just import statements with no suspicious patterns or anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code appears benign.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to others, minimal import statements, standard licensing comments, no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The securityRisk score is slightly above zero but still very low, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The confidence is 0.9, indicating high confidence in benignity.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Justification:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code, network activity, or payloads.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with straightforward import statements and no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** All are 0 or very close to 0, reflecting minimal to no security risk, which is accurate given the code's simplicity.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments needed.\n- The overall code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Estimated scores for this code snippet:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the nature of the code.",
