  "purpose": "Import statements from the cvat_sdk package, setting up SDK components.",
  "sources": "Import statements from cvat_sdk.core.client and cvat_sdk.version modules.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static import statements without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard import statements, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and a license comment, with no executable logic, data handling, or network activity. The imports are from a legitimate SDK, and there are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal code and standard structure support a benign assessment. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this analysis, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and security risk scores at 0 or very close to zero. Confidence levels are high due to the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The import statements are standard and do not pose any threat. The scores across all reports are appropriate, with the exception of report 5's securityRisk score, which should be revised downward to 0. Overall, the code is safe and poses no security concerns.",
