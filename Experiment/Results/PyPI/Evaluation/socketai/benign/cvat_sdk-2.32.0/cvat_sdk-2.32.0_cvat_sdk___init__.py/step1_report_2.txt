{
  "purpose": "The code imports components from the 'cvat_sdk' library, likely used for interacting with a CVAT.ai server for computer vision annotation tasks.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'cvat_sdk.core.client' and 'cvat_sdk.version', which are used to load modules and version info.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling functions are present; no untrusted data is processed or written.",
  "flows": "No data flow is apparent; the code only imports modules and does not process any external input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code are present; the code appears standard for a package's initial import section.",
  "analysis": "The code only includes import statements and a license comment, with no dynamic code, data handling, or external communication. The imports are from a known library intended for client-server communication, but no malicious behavior or obfuscation is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, functioning solely to import modules from a trusted library. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks in this fragment.",
