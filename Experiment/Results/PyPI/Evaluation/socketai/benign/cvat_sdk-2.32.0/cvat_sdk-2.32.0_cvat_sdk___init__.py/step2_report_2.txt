  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, reasoning, and scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements from the 'cvat_sdk' library, with no data processing, network activity, or suspicious patterns.\n- The code snippet is minimal, consisting solely of import statements and license comments.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are identified.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n- Malware scores are zero across all reports, consistent with the benign description.\n- Security risk scores are also low, reflecting the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validity of Issues\n\n**Are the reported issues present?**  \nYes. All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, consisting of standard import statements with no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes in the Reports\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly state that the code is benign, with no anomalies or malicious activity.\n- The analysis is thorough, noting the lack of data flows, suspicious constructs, or external communication.\n- The confidence levels are appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n\n**No significant flaws or mistakes are evident in the reports.**\n\n---\n\n### Scores Evaluation\n\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Malware:** All assign 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Security Risk:** Mostly 0 or very low (0.1 in report 5), which is reasonable given the code's simplicity.\n\n**Are these scores reasonable?**  \nYes. Since the code is just imports with no suspicious activity, the scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for Higher Risk Scores\n\n- The risk scores are all very low (mostly 0 or 0.1). This aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- No reason exists to assign higher risk scores, as there's no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Malware and Obfuscated Scores Reflection\n\n- The malware score is correctly 0 across all reports, as there's no malicious behavior.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Challenging Assumptions\n\n- The reports assume the code is benign based solely on static import statements. This is valid; without runtime context, no malicious activity can be inferred.\n- No assumptions about hidden behavior are made, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency of Scores with the Reports\n\n- All scores are consistent with the analysis and the code snippet.\n- The high confidence levels are justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment\n\n**Considering all reports and the code:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (or very close to zero, e.g., 0.1 for minimal caution)\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign import statement from a well-known SDK, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my evaluation:**\n\n| Metric             | Score | Justification                                              |\n|--------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0       | No malicious behavior detected                               |\n| Obfuscated         | 0       | Clear, straightforward import statements                     |\n| Security Risk      | 0       | No vulnerabilities or risky operations                        |\n\n**Overall, the code is safe, benign, and poses no security concerns.**",
