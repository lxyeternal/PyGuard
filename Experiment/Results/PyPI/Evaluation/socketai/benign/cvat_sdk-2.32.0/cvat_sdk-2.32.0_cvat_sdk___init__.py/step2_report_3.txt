  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the same minimal code: import statements from the 'cvat_sdk' library and license comments.\n- No dynamic code, data processing, network activity, or obfuscated patterns are present.\n- The code appears to be standard SDK setup code, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies the code as benign, with no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The code is straightforward import statements, no malicious behavior.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Assessment:** Also correctly identifies the code as benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious patterns or data flows.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Assessment:** Accurate, noting only import statements and license comments.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Assessment:** Correct, recognizes only import statements and license comments.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious code.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Assessment:** Slightly more cautious, assigns a securityRisk of 0.1, and confidence of 0.9.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — acceptable, given the minimal risk.\n- **Justification:** The low securityRisk score is reasonable, considering the code's benign nature but acknowledging that import statements could, in theory, be used maliciously if combined with other code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward import statements.\n- **Security risk:** All assign 0 or very low (0.1), which is appropriate given the minimal code.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent and justified.\n- No changes needed; the reports correctly identify this as benign setup code.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert estimate:\nGiven the analysis, I concur with the assessments. The code is standard, with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and poses no security risk.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate; the code is benign, with appropriate scoring. No further action or concern is warranted.",
