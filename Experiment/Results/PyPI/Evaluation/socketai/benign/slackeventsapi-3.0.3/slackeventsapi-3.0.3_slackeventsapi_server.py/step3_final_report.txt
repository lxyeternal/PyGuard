  "purpose": "Implements a Flask-based Slack event adapter that verifies request signatures, validates timestamps, parses JSON payloads, and emits events accordingly.",
  "sources": "Request headers ('X-Slack-Request-Timestamp', 'X-Slack-Signature'), request data payload",
  "sinks": "Signature verification function, JSON parsing, event emission",
  "flows": "Headers -> verify_signature -> JSON payload -> emit event",
  "anomalies": "Concatenation of environment info into user-agent string; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code correctly implements signature verification using HMAC SHA-256 with fallback for older Python versions, timestamp validation to prevent replay attacks, and JSON parsing for event handling. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious external calls are present. Signature verification and timestamp checks follow best practices. The environment info concatenation is standard and not malicious but could leak environment details if logs are exposed. Overall, the code is a straightforward, secure implementation of a Slack event handler with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, standard implementation of a Slack event adapter with proper validation and event emission. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The low security risk score of 0.2 is justified, primarily due to minor potential info leakage in environment details, which is not malicious.",
