  "purpose": "Defines the package version identifier as a static string.",
  "sources": "No external sources; the code assigns a hardcoded string to __version__.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no input/output or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Single static assignment; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version string assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static assignment of a version string, with no dynamic behavior, external interactions, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless version string declaration with no security concerns. All assessments and scores are justified and accurate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
