  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the original code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The original code is a straightforward assignment of a static string `'3.0.3'` to the variable `__version__`.\n   - All reports correctly identify that there are no input sources, external data handling, dynamic behavior, or suspicious patterns.\n   - There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities in this snippet.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly note the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign scores of 1 for confidence, and 0 for obfuscation, malware, and security risk.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports and the code itself show no malicious activity, the risk scores are correctly low.\n   - A risk score higher than 0.5 would imply a significant security concern, which is unjustified here.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, aligning with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - The code does not perform any network operations, code execution, or data exfiltration.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are based on straightforward, factual observations.\n   - No assumptions are made about hidden behavior or vulnerabilities.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable assessments are present.\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard, static version assignment in Python.\n- All reports correctly identify the benign nature.\n- No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the code's simplicity and safety profile.",
