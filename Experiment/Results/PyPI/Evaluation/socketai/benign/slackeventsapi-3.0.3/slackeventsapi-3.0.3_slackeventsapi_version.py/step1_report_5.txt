  "analysis": "The code only assigns a static string to the __version__ variable. It references an external URL in a comment but does not perform any input/output operations, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The version string appears standard and does not contain any hidden or malicious payloads. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or anomalous behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign version identifier assignment with no malicious intent or security risks.",
