  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a string value '3.0.3' to the variable __version__, following standard practice for package versioning. There are no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets. The comment references a URL about version identifiers, providing context but not affecting code behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward version assignment with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
