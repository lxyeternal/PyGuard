  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Assessment:** The code is a straightforward setup script. It reads static files and uses regex to parse version info, which is a common pattern. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious behavior.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — justified.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation observed.  \n- **Security risk:** 0 — no security issues identified.  \n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment aligns with the code's behavior. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, standard setup script, safe practices, no malicious code.  \n- **Scores:** All consistent with the code.  \n- **Conclusion:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Assessment:** Again, standard practices, safe version parsing, no suspicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Consistent.  \n- **Conclusion:** No adjustments necessary.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Assessment:** Same pattern, safe regex version parsing, no external or untrusted input handling beyond reading static files.  \n- **Notable point:** The report assigns a securityRisk of 0.1, which is slightly above zero. Given the code's simplicity and lack of any dynamic or network activity, this seems overly cautious.  \n- **Recommendation:** The securityRisk score should be 0, aligning with the other reports and the code's nature.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Assessment:** Same as above, standard setup code, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Consistent.  \n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** All correctly assign 0; no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** Most reports assign 0, except Report 4, which assigns 0.1. Given the code's simplicity and safety, this should be 0.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- The code is a standard, benign setup script for packaging a Python project.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The slight securityRisk score of 0.1 in Report 4 is unwarranted and should be lowered to 0.\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is a typical, safe setup script with no security concerns.",
