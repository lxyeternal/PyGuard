  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python project, reading version info and README, then invoking setup() with metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading version string from a file via regex, reading README file.",
  "sinks": "None; static file reads, no untrusted input handling or external data manipulation.",
  "flows": "Static data from files into setup() parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, straightforward setup.py script. It reads version info via regex from a controlled file, reads README for description, and calls setup() with package metadata. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted input handling is present. The regex parsing is a common pattern and safe. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The minor security risk score of 0.1 in one report is likely due to the regex parsing but does not indicate any malicious intent or vulnerability.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; the slight security risk score of 0.1 can be considered negligible and should be adjusted to 0 for accuracy. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use.",
