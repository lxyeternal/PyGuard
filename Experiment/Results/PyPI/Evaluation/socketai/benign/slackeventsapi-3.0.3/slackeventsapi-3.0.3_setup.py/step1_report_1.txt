{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for packaging a Python project, including reading version info and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from a file via find_version(), reading README.rst for long description.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no data is written to external systems, no untrusted input handling beyond reading static files.",
  "flows": "The version string read from file flows from find_version() to setup() parameters; no other data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; the find_version() function uses regex to parse version info from a file, which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The script reads static files for version info and documentation, then uses setup() to package the project. It includes a function to parse the version string from a source file, which is a common practice. No dynamic or untrusted input handling, no network activity, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical packaging conventions.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears benign, performing standard package configuration tasks without malicious intent or security risks.",
