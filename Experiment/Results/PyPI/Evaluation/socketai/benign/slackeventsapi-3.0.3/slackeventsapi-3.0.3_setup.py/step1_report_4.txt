{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging a Python project called 'slackeventsapi'. It reads version information from a source file and prepares package metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading version string from 'slackeventsapi/version.py'; reading 'README.rst' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input or data; no external data affecting runtime behavior.",
  "flows": "Reading version data from file -> passing version to setup() function; reading README content -> assigning to long_description.",
  "anomalies": "The method of reading version information avoids direct import, which is standard; no suspicious code patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup tasks: importing modules, defining a function to parse version info with regex, reading a README file, and calling setup() with package metadata. No external data sources or untrusted inputs are processed at runtime. The version string is extracted securely using regex without executing code from the version file. No suspicious or malicious code, such as network calls, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms, is present. The code adheres to common Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is straightforward, uses safe patterns, and contains no anomalies or suspicious constructs.",
