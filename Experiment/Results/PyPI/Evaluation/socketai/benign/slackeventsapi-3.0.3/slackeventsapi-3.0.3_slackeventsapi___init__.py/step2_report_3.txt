  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Defines `SlackEventAdapter` extending `BaseEventEmitter`.\n- Requires a non-None `signing_secret` during initialization.\n- Creates a `SlackServer` instance with the secret, endpoint, and other parameters.\n- Provides a `start()` method that calls `self.server.run()` with host, port, debug, and additional kwargs.\n- No obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious external calls, and no evident malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of Each Report**\n\n**Reports 1-5** all conclude that the code is standard, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. They note that:\n- The code properly validates `signing_secret`.\n- The server is started with user-provided parameters.\n- No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns.\n- No evidence of malware or malicious behavior.\n\n**Common observations:**\n- No anomalies or suspicious flows.\n- The use of external libraries (`pyee`, `SlackServer`) appears typical.\n- The server's run method is standard for web servers.\n- No obfuscation or malware scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n### **Assessment of Scores and Logic**\n\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent; no obfuscation is present.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's straightforward nature.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low (0.1-0.2), reflecting the minimal attack surface in this code snippet.\n\n**Potential concerns:**\n- The only minor point is that `kwargs` are passed directly to `self.server.run()`, which could be manipulated if user-controlled. However, this is typical for such frameworks and not inherently malicious.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The logic, reasoning, and scoring are consistent and reasonable.\n- The code is a standard implementation with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Judgment**\n\n**Malware score:** **0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Risk score:** **0.1** — very low, given the lack of vulnerabilities or suspicious patterns.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The code snippet appears safe and typical for a Slack event adapter.\n- The only slight concern is the handling of `kwargs`, but this is standard and not malicious.\n- No evidence supports higher scores.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Score | Justification                                              |\n|------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0            | No malicious activity or payloads present.                   |\n| Obfuscated       | 0            | Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.             |\n| Security Risk    | 0.1          | Minimal risk; standard server setup with validated secret.  |\n\n**Overall, the code appears benign, with no security issues or malware concerns.**",
