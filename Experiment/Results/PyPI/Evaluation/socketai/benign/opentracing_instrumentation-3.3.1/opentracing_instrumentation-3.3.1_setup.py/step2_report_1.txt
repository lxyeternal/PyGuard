  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python library.\n- No dynamic code, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n- Dependencies are typical, and no external or untrusted data is processed at runtime.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain risks are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Assessment:** The code is a straightforward setup.py script with no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Justification:** Correctly identified as benign; no issues.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1; standard package setup with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Justification:** Consistent and appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Assessment:** Again, a typical setup script, no malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Justification:** Correct.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Assessment:** Standard setup, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Justification:** Appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion—benign, standard setup script.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Justification:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of scores:**\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk:** All assign 0, as there's no apparent security concern.\n\n### **Final evaluation:**\n- The code is a typical, benign setup.py script.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements are present.\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and justified.\n\n### **Additional notes:**\n- The malware score should remain at 0; there's no evidence of malicious intent.\n- Obfuscation score should be 0; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- Risk score is appropriately 0; no security vulnerabilities or supply chain risks are evident.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code is safe.
