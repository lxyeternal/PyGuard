{
  "purpose": "Standard setup.py script for packaging the Python library 'opentracing_instrumentation'.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long_description; static metadata and dependencies specified directly in code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, external calls, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "Static data used for package configuration; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, static, and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that reads a local README file and specifies package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. Dependencies are standard and well-known. No external or untrusted data sources are processed at runtime. The code structure and content indicate a benign package configuration without malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are justified and consistent with the code content.",
