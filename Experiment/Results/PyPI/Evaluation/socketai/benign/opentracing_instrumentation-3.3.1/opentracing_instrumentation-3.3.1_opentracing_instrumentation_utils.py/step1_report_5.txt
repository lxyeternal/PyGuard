{
  "purpose": "Provide a utility function to start tracing spans for distributed tracing using the opentracing library.",
  "sources": "operation_name parameter, tracer parameter, parent parameter, and tags parameter",
  "sinks": "The function primarily calls tracer.start_span which creates a span object; no direct sinks for untrusted data are evident",
  "flows": "operation_name and tags are passed from input to tracer.start_span; tracer and parent influence span creation",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected. The code is straightforward and standard for tracing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to create a new tracing span, defaulting to the global opentracing tracer if none is provided. Inputs include operation name, optional tracer, parent span, and tags. It then calls start_span on the tracer object, passing appropriate parameters. No suspicious logic, no data leaks, no malicious behavior, and no obfuscation are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility function for initiating tracing spans, with no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues. It relies on the external opentracing library, which is typical for distributed tracing implementations.",
