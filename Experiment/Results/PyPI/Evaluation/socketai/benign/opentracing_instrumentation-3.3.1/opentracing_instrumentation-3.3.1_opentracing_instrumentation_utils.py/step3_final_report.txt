  "purpose": "Utility function to start a new tracing span as a child or root span using the opentracing API.",
  "sources": "Parameters: operation_name, tracer (or default global tracer), parent span, tags.",
  "sinks": "Call to tracer.start_span() with operation_name, child_of (from parent.context), and tags.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into tracer.start_span() to create a new span.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of external library; no obfuscation or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, well-documented wrapper around opentracing's start_span method. It accepts user inputs for operation name, parent span, and tags, passing them directly to the tracer. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present. The only potential concern is if untrusted data is passed into operation_name, tags, or parent, which could mislead traces but is a typical usage consideration rather than a flaw. The code relies on trusted external libraries and performs no network or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for distributed tracing with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 is appropriate, reflecting potential misuse of untrusted inputs, but not an actual vulnerability.",
