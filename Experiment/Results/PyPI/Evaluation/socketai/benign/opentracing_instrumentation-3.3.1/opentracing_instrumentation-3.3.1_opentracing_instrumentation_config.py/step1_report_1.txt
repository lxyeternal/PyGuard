  "purpose": "Define a configuration class for managing HTTP header-related settings within an application.",
  "sources": "The constructor of the _Config class, which reads optional parameter app_name and initializes header lists.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing points are present in the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from instantiation parameters (app_name) to internal attributes; no external data flows or processing are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; the code is straightforward and follows common design patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a configuration class with attributes for HTTP header management. It creates a singleton instance of _Config. The code is minimal, with no external data input, no dangerous functions, and no obfuscated or malicious logic. The use of __future__ and builtins is standard for compatibility. No security risks or malware indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, standard configuration class with no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger system for handling service headers, with no indications of malicious intent.",
