  "purpose": "Define a configuration class for managing HTTP header information related to service calls",
  "sources": "None (no input sources in the code)",
  "sinks": "None (no data outputs or external effects)",
  "flows": "N/A (no data flow from sources to sinks in this code)",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and standard; no suspicious or unusual code constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a configuration class with attributes for HTTP headers related to service call metadata. It creates a singleton instance of this configuration. There are no input or output operations, external data processing, or dynamic code execution. The code is consistent with typical configuration setup and does not contain obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration class with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any external actions, data leaks, or contain suspicious patterns.",
