  "purpose": "Define a configuration class for handling service-related HTTP headers, and create a singleton instance for application-wide use.",
  "sources": "The class constructor (__init__) initializes instance variables; the CONFIG singleton is created at the module level.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data flow to external systems; no untrusted data handling or output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code merely sets up data structures.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and typical for configuration purposes. No hardcoded secrets, no unusual code patterns, and no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "This module provides a simple configuration class with default empty header lists and a singleton instance. It contains no data processing, input handling, or external communication. The license header indicates open-source sharing, and the code adheres to common design patterns without suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard configuration setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
