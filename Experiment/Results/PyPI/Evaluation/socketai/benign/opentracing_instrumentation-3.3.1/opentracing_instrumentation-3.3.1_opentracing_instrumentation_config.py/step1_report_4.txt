  "purpose": "Define a configuration class for managing HTTP header information related to service calls within an application.",
  "sources": "Instantiation of the _Config class and setting default header lists in the constructor.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data output points are present in the code.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of the CONFIG singleton object from the _Config class; no data flow involving untrusted input is present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple configuration class with attributes for storing HTTP header information related to service calls. The class is instantiated as a singleton CONFIG object. There are no input/output operations, data processing, or external calls that could lead to security issues. The code uses standard Python practices with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration setup with no malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies. It serves as a simple data holder for header configuration. Overall security risk is negligible.",
