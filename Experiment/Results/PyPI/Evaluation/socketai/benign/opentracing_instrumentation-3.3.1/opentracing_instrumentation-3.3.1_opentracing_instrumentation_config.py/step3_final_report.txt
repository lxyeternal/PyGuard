  "purpose": "Configuration class for managing HTTP headers related to service calls",
  "sources": "No external data sources; class attributes initialized as empty lists",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no external output or data flow to untrusted sources",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; purely static configuration",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, standard, and lacks obfuscation or malicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple configuration class with attributes for HTTP headers, creates a singleton instance, and contains no external input, output, or dynamic code execution. It does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain any suspicious constructs. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No logical flaws or security issues are present, and the code functions as a benign configuration setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard configuration class with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with its simple, static nature.",
