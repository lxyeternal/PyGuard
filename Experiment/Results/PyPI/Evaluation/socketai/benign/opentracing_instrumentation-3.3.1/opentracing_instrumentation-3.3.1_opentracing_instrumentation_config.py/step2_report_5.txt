  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Defines a simple class `_Config` with attributes for HTTP header management.\n- The class constructor accepts an optional `app_name` parameter.\n- Creates a singleton instance `CONFIG` at the module level.\n- No external data, input/output, or processing.\n- No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code\n- **Are there any security issues?**  \n  No. The code is a straightforward configuration class with no external input, no data processing, and no network or file operations.\n\n- **Are there any vulnerabilities?**  \n  No. The code does not handle untrusted data, does not execute dynamic code, and does not contain hardcoded secrets.\n\n- **Is there malware?**  \n  No. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or payload delivery.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, with no security issues or malware.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in logic\n- The code is minimal and correct for its purpose.  \n- No logical flaws or mistakes are evident.  \n- The singleton pattern is simple and standard.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nNo logical errors or flaws.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Review scores assigned to each report\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n  - `confidence`: 1\n\nThese are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Suggestion:**  \nScores seem appropriate; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5\n- The highest scores are 0 for malware and security risk, which is justified given the benign nature.\n- No reason to increase scores; the code poses no threat.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Review malware score\n- All reports have malware score 0, which is correct.\n- The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities\n- The reports correctly assume no external input handling or dangerous behavior.\n- No assumptions of hidden malicious behavior are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Consistency of scores\n- All scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final step: My own assessment\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign configuration class with no security issues, malware, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n## Summary:\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors or flaws?** No.\n- **Scores reasonable?** Yes.\n- **Adjusted scores:** No change needed.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nKeep all scores at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk. The code is safe and standard.",
