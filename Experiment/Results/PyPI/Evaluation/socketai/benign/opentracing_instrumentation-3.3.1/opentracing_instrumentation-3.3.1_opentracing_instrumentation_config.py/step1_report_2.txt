  "purpose": "Defines a configuration class for managing HTTP header information related to service calls",
  "sources": "Instantiation of the _Config class, assignment to the CONFIG singleton",
  "labs": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs are read; configuration parameters are set directly or through class instantiation",
  "flows": "No flow of untrusted data from sources to sinks; data flows only within the class during instantiation and assignment",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or suspicious logic; the code is straightforward and configuration-focused",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple configuration class with attributes for headers related to service call identification. It creates a singleton CONFIG object. There are no input handling, data processing, or external data sources involved. The code appears to be a standard setup for managing HTTP headers in a service environment, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration setup without malicious intent or security risks. It simply initializes a configuration object for managing HTTP headers, with no external data processing or suspicious behavior.",
