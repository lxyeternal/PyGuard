{
  "purpose": "Provides tracing decorators and context managers for distributed tracing in Tornado applications, managing spans, context, and exception logging.",
  "sources": "Reads current span via get_current_span(), function parameters, and context managers.",
  "sinks": "Logs and tags within spans; potential data leaks if misused, but standard practice.",
  "flows": "Source: get_current_span() and function args -> span creation and logging -> exception handling and span finishing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard distributed tracing utilities using OpenTracing and Tornado, managing span lifecycle, context, and exception logging. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling are present. The code relies on well-known libraries and practices, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent. The flow of span creation, exception logging, and context management aligns with typical tracing implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard tracing utility with no malicious or obfuscated elements. It poses minimal security risk and is appropriate for supply chain use. The scores are justified: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
