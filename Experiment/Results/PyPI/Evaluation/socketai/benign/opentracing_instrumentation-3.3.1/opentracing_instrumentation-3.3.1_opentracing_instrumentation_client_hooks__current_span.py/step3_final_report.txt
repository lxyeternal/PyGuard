  "purpose": "Provides a mechanism to override the default span extraction function used in tracing.",
  "sources": "Import of get_current_span from a relative module.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "Assignment of get_current_span to current_span_func; potential override via set_current_span_func.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward function assignment and override pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function, assigns it to a variable, and offers a setter to override this variable. No malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The override mechanism is typical in plugin systems but could be misused if untrusted functions are supplied. No data leaks, network activity, or secret handling are involved. The code's simplicity and lack of external dependencies or malicious payloads indicate a benign intent. The potential risk stems solely from external misuse, not from the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for configuring span extraction in tracing systems. It introduces a minor security concern if untrusted code supplies a malicious override function, but this is a common pattern and not inherently malicious. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting potential misuse but no active threat.",
