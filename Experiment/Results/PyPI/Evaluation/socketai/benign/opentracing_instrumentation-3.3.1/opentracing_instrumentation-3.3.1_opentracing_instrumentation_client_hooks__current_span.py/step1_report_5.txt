{
  "purpose": "The code defines a mechanism to override a function that retrieves the current span in a tracing context, likely for instrumentation or monitoring purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module, and the input parameter 'span_extractor_func' in 'set_current_span_func' function.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to the global variable 'current_span_func', which influences how the current span is retrieved in other parts of the application.",
  "flows": "External code can pass a custom function ('span_extractor_func') to override the default span retrieval method, affecting subsequent calls to 'current_span_func'.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious patterns. The code provides a flexible override mechanism without hardcoded secrets or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a function to get the current span, assigns it to a variable, and provides a setter to override this variable. This pattern is typical for configurable behavior. No hardcoded credentials, malicious payloads, or suspicious logic are present. The code is straightforward and appears to be part of an instrumentation or monitoring system, with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration utility allowing the override of span extraction logic. It does not contain malware or security risks. It appears intended for flexible tracing implementation with no malicious behavior.",
