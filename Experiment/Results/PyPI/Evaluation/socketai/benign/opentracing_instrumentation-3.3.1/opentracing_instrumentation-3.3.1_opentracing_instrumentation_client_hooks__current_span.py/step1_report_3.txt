{
  "purpose": "Allows setting and overriding a function to extract the current tracing span, likely used for distributed tracing in an application.",
  "sources": "Import statement from parent package; get_current_span function.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data leaks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "get_current_span is assigned to current_span_func; set_current_span_func can override current_span_func with a new function.",
  "anomalies": "The ability to override the get_current_span function dynamically could be suspicious if misused, but in this context, it appears to be a standard override mechanism for tracing.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function get_current_span, assigns it to a variable, and provides a setter function to override this assignment. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as hidden backdoors, malicious data exfiltration, or suspicious code injection. The code is straightforward and appears to facilitate flexible tracing configuration. No sensitive data handling or external network interactions are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign utility for setting a custom span extraction function in a tracing context. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
