  "purpose": "Provides utilities for extracting and managing OpenTracing spans from HTTP requests, supporting different web frameworks.",
  "sources": "Request properties such as headers, method, URL, remote IP, and port; extraction of tracing context from headers.",
  "sinks": "Extraction and starting of tracing spans; no data sinks or external data output are present.",
  "flows": "Headers are read from request objects, used to extract tracing context, and passed to span creation. No data is written or transmitted outside the tracing process.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code appears standard for distributed tracing instrumentation with no hardcoded credentials, suspicious data manipulation, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code implements request wrappers for different web frameworks, extracting request data and propagating tracing context using opentracing. It reads headers and request properties safely, with exception handling during context extraction. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident; all operations align with standard tracing practices. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "This module performs standard distributed tracing instrumentation for HTTP requests. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and intended for proper trace context propagation.",
