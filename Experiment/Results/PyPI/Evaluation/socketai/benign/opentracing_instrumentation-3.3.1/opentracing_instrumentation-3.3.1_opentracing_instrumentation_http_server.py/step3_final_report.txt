  "purpose": "Utility functions and classes for extracting and propagating distributed tracing context from HTTP requests, supporting multiple frameworks.",
  "sources": "Request headers, request properties such as full_url, method, remote_ip, remote_port, and environment variables (for WSGI).",
  "sinks": "Tracer extraction (`tracer.extract`) and span creation (`tracer.start_span`).",
  "flows": "Headers and request properties flow into context extraction, which then leads to span creation; exception handling manages extraction failures.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard distributed tracing utilities, wrapping request objects to extract context and start spans. It uses well-established libraries and practices, with proper exception handling. No malicious or security-compromising behavior is evident. The code is clear, straightforward, and adheres to best practices for such instrumentation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of distributed tracing support, with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
