{
  "purpose": "Define abstract and concrete classes for OpenTracing interceptors and manage interceptor instances for instrumentation.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class definitions, and method implementations that handle interceptor creation, registration, and processing.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; code mainly manages class instances and method calls.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is primarily class and method definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes an abstract base class for interceptors, a concrete class for managing multiple interceptors, and methods for adding, inserting, retrieving, and clearing interceptors. All functionalities involve class management and validation of interceptor types. No external input processing, no data leakage, and no code injection mechanisms are present. No suspicious network or file operations are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of an interceptor pattern for tracing instrumentation. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It primarily manages interceptor objects with proper type checks. No security threats are identified.",
