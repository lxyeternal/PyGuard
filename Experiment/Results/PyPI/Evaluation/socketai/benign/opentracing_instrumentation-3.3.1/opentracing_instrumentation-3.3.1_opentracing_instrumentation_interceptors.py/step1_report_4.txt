  "purpose": "Define an abstract class for OpenTracing interceptors and a collection class to manage interceptor instances for use in tracing instrumentation.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class definitions, methods, and docstrings.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or external effects; no data leaks or command executions present.",
  "flows": "N/A - No data flow from sources to sinks identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward and adheres to common design patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract base class for interceptors with a required 'process' method, and a manager class that handles a list of interceptors with methods to add, insert, retrieve, and clear interceptors. All methods perform standard operations with input validation ensuring only instances of the correct class are added. No external data handling, network operations, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code appears to be a standard implementation for plugin management in tracing instrumentation, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard pattern for managing tracing interceptors. No malicious intent or security issues are detected. The code serves as a framework component without any malicious or harmful behavior.",
