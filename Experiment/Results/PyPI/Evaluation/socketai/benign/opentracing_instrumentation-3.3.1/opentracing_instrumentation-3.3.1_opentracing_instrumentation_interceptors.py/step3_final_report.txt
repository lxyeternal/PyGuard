{
  "purpose": "Defines an abstract class for OpenTracing interceptors and a manager class to handle multiple interceptors with type safety.",
  "sources": "Class definitions, method calls for appending, inserting, retrieving, and clearing interceptors, and type checks.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, network operations, or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Method calls for adding interceptors, type checks, and list management without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard framework component for managing interceptors in a tracing system. It enforces type safety, provides documentation, and manages a list of interceptor instances. No external data, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code is well-structured, readable, and free of malicious logic or obfuscation. The type checks prevent misuse but do not introduce security risks. The documentation and usage examples are typical for such patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of an interceptor management pattern for tracing instrumentation. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate and justified.",
