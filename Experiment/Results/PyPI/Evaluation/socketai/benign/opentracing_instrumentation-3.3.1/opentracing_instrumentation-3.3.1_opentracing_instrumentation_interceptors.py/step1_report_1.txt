  "purpose": "Define an abstract interceptor class for OpenTracing and manage client interceptors for tracing.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, abc, six, and class definitions using standard Python modules.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data flows into sensitive operations or external systems.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow paths identified; code mainly manages class definitions and list operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code is primarily standard interface and list management.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract base class for tracing interceptors and a manager class for appending, inserting, retrieving, and clearing interceptors. Usage examples are provided in docstrings. The code relies on standard modules, with no external data handling or network operations. It appears to be a typical implementation for managing tracing interceptors, with no malicious or suspicious logic. The design enforces type checks for interceptors, preventing invalid objects from being added. There are no signs of malicious intent, code injection, or data leakage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign implementation of an interceptor pattern for OpenTracing. It manages interceptor instances safely and does not exhibit any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
