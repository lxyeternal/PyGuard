{
  "purpose": "Provide deprecation warnings for functions and classes, and handle Python version compatibility.",
  "sources": "Readings include sys.version_info for version detection, __name__ attributes for function/class names, and input parameters for decorators.",
  "sinks": "Warn function outputs, dynamic decorator wrapping, and potential usage of deprecated functions/classes.",
  "flows": "Input data (function/class) flows through the decorator, triggering warnings during call.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code structures; the code performs standard deprecation warning logic and version compatibility checks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a warning mechanism with the warn() function, which emits DeprecationWarnings. The deprecated decorator wraps functions or classes to add warning messages on invocation. Version detection is used for compatibility, defining types accordingly. There are no indications of malicious activities such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code operates within typical patterns for deprecation handling, with proper use of warnings and decorators. No hardcoded credentials, external network calls, or obfuscated patterns are present. The code is standard, well-structured, and aimed at informing developers about deprecated elements.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements standard deprecation warnings and Python version compatibility features without any malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and commonly used in production codebases.",
