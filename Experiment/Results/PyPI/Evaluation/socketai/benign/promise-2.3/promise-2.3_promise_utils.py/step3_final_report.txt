{
  "purpose": "Provides deprecation warnings and maintains compatibility between Python 2 and 3 by defining type aliases and a decorator for deprecation notices.",
  "sources": "The warn() function emits warnings; the deprecated class wraps functions/classes to issue warnings upon invocation; sys.version_info is used to determine Python version for type definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process external input or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "The warn() function flows from warning trigger to warning emission; the deprecated decorator flows from decoration to warning issuance upon function or class call.",
  "anomalies": "The constructor of the deprecated class raises a TypeError if reason is a class or function, which is counterintuitive; typically, reason should be a string. This logical flaw is an anomaly.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard deprecation and compatibility utilities without malicious or obfuscated code. The warning filter adjustments are benign. The only notable issue is the flawed check in the deprecated class constructor, which incorrectly raises an error when reason is a class or function, preventing passing a string reason. Overall, the code is straightforward, with no external network activity, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for deprecation warnings and Python version compatibility, with a minor logical flaw in the constructor argument validation. It does not contain malware or security risks. The overall security risk is negligible, and the malware and obfuscation scores are zero.",
