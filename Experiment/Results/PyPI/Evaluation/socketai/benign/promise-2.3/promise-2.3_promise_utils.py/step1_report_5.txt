{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for issuing deprecation warnings and handling Python version differences in string and type representations.",
  "sources": "The code reads system version info (sys.version_info), uses the warnings module to emit warnings, and inspects functions and classes using the inspect module.",
  "sinks": "The code calls warnings.warn(), which could display messages, and accesses attributes like __name__ on function or class objects, but these are safe and standard operations.",
  "flows": "System info (version) -> conditional logic determining types; Function or class usage -> __call__ method triggers warn() -> message displayed to user.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses deprecated Python 2 constructs such as 'basestring', 'long', and 'types.ClassType', which may lead to compatibility issues but are not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious dynamic code execution are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a warning utility and a decorator for deprecation, which are standard features. It checks Python version to assign type aliases for compatibility, following common practices. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code operates within typical bounds of a utility library for deprecation handling and version compatibility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for deprecation warnings and Python 2/3 compatibility handling. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It mainly issues warnings and manages compatibility, with no evident malicious intent.",
