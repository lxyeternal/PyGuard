{
  "purpose": "This code provides utilities for deprecation warnings and type definitions compatible with Python 2 and 3.",
  "sources": "The code reads system version info (sys.version_info) and input parameters for decorators.",
  "sinks": "The code uses warnings.warn to output deprecation messages.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (reason, name) flow into the warn function via decorators; sys.version_info flows into type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code. The warn function temporarily modifies warning filters but resets them immediately, which is benign. The deprecation decorator properly formats messages and applies warnings.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a warn function that issues deprecation warnings with temporary filter changes, which are reset immediately, thus unlikely to cause issues. The deprecated class creates a decorator to mark functions or classes as deprecated, issuing warnings when invoked. The version info checks differentiate between Python 2 and 3, setting type variables accordingly. No obfuscated or malicious code structures are present. The overall structure is typical for deprecation handling and compatibility across Python versions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, harmless utility module for deprecation warnings and Python version compatibility. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware signals are present.",
