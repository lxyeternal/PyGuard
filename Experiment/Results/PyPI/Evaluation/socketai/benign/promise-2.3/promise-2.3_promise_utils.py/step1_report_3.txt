{
  "purpose": "Provides deprecation warnings for functions and classes, and defines type-related constants for Python 2 and 3 compatibility.",
  "sources": "The code reads Python version info from sys.version_info, inspects functions and classes using the inspect module, and accesses built-in types such as str, unicode, and long.",
  "sinks": "The code warns via warnings.warn, which could potentially be used maliciously if the message is manipulated, but in this context, it is used for benign deprecation notices.",
  "flows": "Source: sys.version_info, inspect module, built-in types -> Sink: warnings.warn with formatted message",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present. The code performs standard deprecation and compatibility tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a warn() function that triggers DeprecationWarnings, which is typical for deprecation notices. The deprecated class wraps functions and classes to issue warnings upon invocation. Compatibility constants are set based on Python version, using standard sys and inspect modules. No external or suspicious data sources or sinks are used. The flow from version info or inspect checks to warnings is straightforward and benign. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for deprecation warnings and Python 2/3 compatibility, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
