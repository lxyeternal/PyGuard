{
  "purpose": "The code provides decorators for deprecation warnings and defines compatibility variables for Python 2 and 3.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info for Python version detection, inspect functions for argument validation, no external data sources",
  "sinks": "warn() function outputs warnings, which could potentially be exploited if manipulated, but standard warnings are generally safe",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows detected; input data flow is limited to internal function parameters and version info checks",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. The warning function adjusts warning filters temporarily, which is standard practice",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator class for marking functions or classes as deprecated, issuing warnings when called. It performs version detection and defines type aliases for compatibility. The warning mechanism is straightforward and does not execute untrusted data or system commands. There are no signs of obfuscated code or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be standard utility code for deprecation warnings and Python version compatibility. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks identified.",
