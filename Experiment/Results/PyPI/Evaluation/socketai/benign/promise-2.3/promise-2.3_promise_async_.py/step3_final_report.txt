{
  "purpose": "The code implements an asynchronous task queue and promise handling system inspired by Bluebird, managing scheduled execution and promise resolution.",
  "sources": "Functions receiving callbacks or promises, internal queues (late_queue, normal_queue), and external scheduler objects providing call, call_later, and wait methods.",
  "sinks": "Execution of queued functions or promise resolutions, potential exception raising via throw_later, and external scheduler invocation.",
  "flows": "Functions enqueued via _async_invoke, _async_invoke_later, and _async_settle_promise are eventually executed in drain_queue or drain_queue_until_resolved, with external scheduler methods invoked in invoke, wait, and throw_later.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an 'if False' block with unused imports, likely a placeholder or residual code; no malicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of an async task scheduler and promise handler, with queue management, scheduling, and promise resolution. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The 'if False' block is benign. The external scheduler dependency is typical but requires trust; the code itself does not perform network activity or data exfiltration. The exception raising in throw_later is standard for async error handling. Overall, the code is straightforward, well-structured, and aligns with common async patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard async task and promise management system with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The minimal risk score reflects reliance on external schedulers but does not indicate malicious intent.",
