{
  "purpose": "This code provides an asynchronous task scheduling and promise resolution mechanism, inspired by the Bluebird library, to manage and execute queued functions and promises.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from internal class attributes, method parameters (such as functions and scheduler objects), and promise states. It also imports deque from collections and local from threading.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include calls to scheduler.call(), scheduler.call_later(), promise._settle_promises(), and promise.scheduler.wait(), which execute functions and manage promise states.",
  "flows": "Functions enqueue tasks into internal queues; the queues are drained via drain_queue or drain_queue_until_resolved methods; scheduled functions or promise resolutions are executed; wait() method interacts with promise and scheduler states.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains an import of Promise with a conditional (if False), suggesting a placeholder or placeholder code; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code is evident. The use of raise in throw_later() is standard for error propagation. No obfuscated or suspicious language features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements an async queueing system with methods for enqueuing and draining functions or promises, managing the queue states, and integrating with external schedulers. No signs of data exfiltration, malicious network activity, or backdoors are present. The conditional import of Promise appears to be a placeholder or a stub, not malicious. The functions perform expected async queue management without malicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation of an asynchronous task scheduler with promise management, modeled after known patterns. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The only minor concern is the placeholder import statement which could be a non-functional stub. Overall, it is a benign utility module.",
