{
  "purpose": "Define compatibility shims for asyncio and inspect modules, providing fallback implementations if imports fail.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'iscoroutine', 'Future', 'ensure_future', and local import of 'iterate_promise'.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly processes untrusted data or interacts with external inputs that could lead to data leaks or vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "N/A - The code primarily provides fallback functions and classes for missing modules without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The fallback implementations raise exceptions if asyncio is not available, which may disrupt normal operation but do not perform malicious actions. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code checks for optional module imports ('inspect', 'asyncio', local 'iterate_promise') and provides fallback implementations that raise exceptions if the modules are missing. These fallbacks are standard practices for compatibility and do not exhibit malicious behavior. The use of exception raising to enforce dependencies is not suspicious. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed for compatibility and does not contain malicious intent. It enforces the presence of certain modules but does not perform any harmful actions or contain malware signatures.",
