  "purpose": "Provide compatibility functions for asyncio and inspect modules, ensuring fallback behavior when imports fail.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'inspect', 'asyncio', and a local module '.iterate_promise'.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data or untrusted input handling occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code defines fallback functions and classes that raise exceptions if dependencies are missing.",
  "anomalies": "The fallback classes and functions intentionally raise exceptions when called, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import modules and classes for asynchronous programming. If the imports fail, it defines fallback functions and classes that raise exceptions if used, to prevent runtime errors. The fallback classes do not perform any malicious actions; they simply raise exceptions indicating missing dependencies. The code structure is straightforward, and no suspicious patterns or malicious behavior are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is designed to ensure compatibility and graceful failure if certain modules are missing. It does not contain malicious intent or harmful behavior. The raising of exceptions in fallback classes is a defensive measure, not malicious. Overall, the code appears safe.",
