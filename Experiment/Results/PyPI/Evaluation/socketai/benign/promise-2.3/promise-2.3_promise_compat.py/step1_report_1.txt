{
  "purpose": "The code provides compatibility shims for asynchronous programming constructs (`iscoroutine`, `Future`, `ensure_future`, and `iterate_promise`) across different Python environments, ensuring that the larger application can work with or without asyncio support.",
  "sources": [
    "import statements for `iscoroutine`, `Future`, `ensure_future`",
    "fallback definitions for these functions and classes",
    "import from `.iterate_promise` module"
  ],
  "sinks": [
    "None directly present; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks within this code",
    "Potentially, if `iterate_promise` is used elsewhere, it could be a sink for promises, but here it's just a stub"
  ],
  "flows": [
    "import `iscoroutine` -> fallback function if import fails",
    "import `Future`, `ensure_future` -> fallback class/function if import fails",
    "import `iterate_promise` from local module -> fallback function if import fails"
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "The fallback `Future` class raises exceptions immediately upon instantiation and method calls, which is unusual but not malicious—it's designed to prevent use if asyncio is missing.",
    "The fallback `ensure_future` function raises an exception when called, indicating that asyncio is required.",
    "The fallback `iterate_promise` raises an exception if the import fails, suggesting that the code relies on syntax (`yield from`) for promise iteration."
  ],
  "analysis": "The code is primarily compatibility boilerplate to handle the absence of asyncio or certain syntax features. It defines fallback functions and classes that either raise exceptions or do nothing to prevent runtime errors. No data is read from external sources, and there are no network or file operations. The code does not execute any untrusted data, nor does it perform any suspicious actions. The fallback implementations that raise exceptions serve as safeguards and are not malicious. The overall structure is straightforward and typical for compatibility layers.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility layer intended to support asynchronous features across different Python environments. There is no malicious behavior, backdoor, or supply chain threat present. It simply ensures that the application fails gracefully if required modules are missing, without any hidden or malicious intent.",
