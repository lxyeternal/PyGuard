  "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility shim designed to handle missing dependencies gracefully. It contains no malicious or obfuscated code, backdoors, or security threats. The fallback functions raising exceptions are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 reflects potential runtime errors if dependencies are absent but does not imply security issues."
