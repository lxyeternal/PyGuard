  "purpose": "Compatibility layer providing fallback implementations for asyncio constructs and iterate_promise, raising exceptions if dependencies are missing.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'iscoroutine', 'Future', 'ensure_future', and 'iterate_promise'; fallback functions and classes that raise exceptions upon invocation.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Fallback classes and functions raise exceptions instead of providing functionality, which is unusual but intentional for dependency enforcement.",
  "analysis": "The code defines compatibility shims for asyncio components and a local module, with fallback implementations that raise exceptions if dependencies are missing. It does not perform any network, file, or data exfiltration activities. The exception-raising fallbacks serve as dependency checks and are standard in compatibility code. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The code's purpose is to ensure graceful failure in environments lacking certain modules, not to conceal malicious activity. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with this benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility shim designed to handle missing dependencies gracefully. It contains no malicious or obfuscated code, backdoors, or security threats. The fallback functions raising exceptions are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 reflects potential runtime errors if dependencies are absent but does not imply security issues.",
