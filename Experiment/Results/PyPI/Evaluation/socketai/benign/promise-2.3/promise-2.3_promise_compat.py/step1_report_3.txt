  "purpose": "Define fallback functions for asyncio features and promise iteration if the necessary modules or syntax are unavailable.",
  "sources": "Imports from inspect, asyncio, and local module 'iterate_promise'.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code primarily defines fallback functions and exception raising.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exception handling to define placeholder functions that raise exceptions if dependencies are missing; no malicious intent but indicates compatibility checks.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import asyncio-related functions and classes; if unavailable, defines placeholders that raise exceptions. It also tries to import a local module 'iterate_promise', with fallback that raises an exception if import fails. All behavior is confined to dependency checks and placeholder definitions, with no suspicious or malicious behavior evident. The code does not perform any network communication, data leakage, or malicious operations. The fallback functions simply raise errors indicating missing dependencies, which is standard practice for compatibility handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard compatibility layer that defines fallback functions raising exceptions if required dependencies are missing. There is no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or malware. It appears to be benign and designed for error handling regarding optional asyncio support.",
