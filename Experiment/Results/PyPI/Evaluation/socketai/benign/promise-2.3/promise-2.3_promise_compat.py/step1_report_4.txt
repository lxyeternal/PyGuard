  "purpose": "Provide fallback implementations for asyncio and inspect modules if they are not available, ensuring compatibility across environments.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'iscoroutine', 'Future', 'ensure_future', and 'iterate_promise'; fallback function definitions and class initializations.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no data is being processed or transmitted to untrusted sources or external systems.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; all functions are defensive fallbacks raising exceptions if used in incompatible environments.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exception-raising stubs to indicate missing dependencies; no suspicious or malicious code behaviors. The fallback functions clearly signal missing features rather than hiding malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import modules and functions critical for asyncio operations, providing fallback implementations if they are absent. The fallback classes and functions only raise exceptions indicating missing dependencies, which is a common pattern for compatibility layers. The 'iterate_promise' fallback similarly raises an exception if invoked, signaling that the environment does not support certain syntax. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs. The purpose appears to be compatibility rather than malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility shim that gracefully handles missing dependencies by raising exceptions. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The implementation is straightforward and intended for environment compatibility without any hidden malicious intent.",
