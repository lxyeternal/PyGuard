  "purpose": "Implementation of a DataLoader class for batching and caching asynchronous data loading operations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to class methods (e.g., load, load_many, prime, clear), external modules (Promise, get_default_scheduler), and internal queue management.",
  "sinks": "Promise resolution/rejection, cache operations, and batch load function invocation.",
  "flows": "Input data from method parameters flows through caching checks or into batch load functions, with promise resolution/rejection managing data flow back to callers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or obvious backdoors. Use of dynamic promise creation and batch scheduling appears standard. No suspicious network activity, file operations, or environment variable usage is detected. The code structure is typical of a data loader implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard DataLoader pattern with batching and caching for asynchronous operations. It imports typical libraries, defines a class with methods for loading, batching, caching, and cache management, and manages promise-based asynchronous control flow. There are no indications of malicious code or sabotage, such as network communication, file modifications, or embedded backdoors. The use of Promise and scheduling functions aligns with common async patterns, and no obfuscated or suspicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a DataLoader utility for batching asynchronous data requests. No malicious or sabotage behaviors are detected. It adheres to standard patterns and practices for async data handling and caching.",
