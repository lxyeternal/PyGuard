  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes the Promise implementation, which aligns with the code.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No suspicious data flows or external network activity. Data flows through standard promise resolution/rejection pathways.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. Use of 'weakref' and deprecation warnings are benign.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, standard Promise library with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. The confidence is high (0.95).\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, consistent.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data may flow through handlers; potential for untrusted data propagation exists but is inherent to promise systems.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious external activity detected. The mention of untrusted data is standard.\n- **Conclusion:** Low security risk, assuming handlers are trusted.\n- **Scores Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Confidence 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Similar to previous, standard promise data flow.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity; external functions are assumed safe.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate implementation, low security risk.\n- **Scores Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Confidence 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Consistent with code.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Standard data flow, no external malicious activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation or malicious code detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard Promise implementation.\n- **Scores Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Confidence 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows through handlers; potential for untrusted data, but typical for promises.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns, no network or system modifications.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard, safe implementation.\n- **Scores Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Confidence 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- All reports correctly identify this as a standard Promise implementation.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- The risk scores are low and justified.\n- The malware scores are 0 across all reports, consistent with the analysis.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- The security risk scores are uniformly low (0.2), reflecting typical concerns about untrusted handlers but no actual malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Keep at 0, as no malicious behavior is detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Keep at 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 is reasonable, considering the potential for untrusted data handling but not actual malicious activity.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThe code is a legitimate, well-structured Promise library for Python, with no malicious intent or sabotage detected.",
