{
  "purpose": "The code implements a Promise class adhering to the Promises/A+ specification for asynchronous programming in Python, including methods for resolution, rejection, chaining, and utility functions for handling collections of promises.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the 'executor' function passed during Promise initialization, asynchronous Future objects, coroutine objects, and potentially data passed into static methods like 'resolve', 'reject', 'all', or 'for_dict'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the resolve and reject callbacks that pass data to promise handlers, internal methods that fulfill or reject promises, and the handling of Future or coroutine results which could contain untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input data from executor functions or external async results flow into promise resolution or rejection pathways; these then cascade through fulfillment or rejection handlers, potentially propagating data to chained promises.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains standard promise handling logic with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. Use of 'weakref' for internal tracking, and the presence of deprecated method warnings are benign. No suspicious network activity, data leaks, or privacy violations are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive Promise implementation with methods for creation, chaining, and collection handling. It manages internal states carefully, supports asynchronous operations with futures and coroutines, and employs proper exception handling via 'try_catch'. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network calls, or malicious behavior are detected. The code structure aligns with standard asynchronous programming patterns. The presence of deprecated warnings and flexible input handling shows maintenance and compatibility considerations but does not introduce security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a legitimate Promise library for Python, adhering to standard async patterns without any signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The code's purpose is to facilitate asynchronous programming safely, with no hidden backdoors or malicious behaviors detected.",
