{
  "purpose": "This code implements a Promise class following Promises/A+ specification, providing asynchronous operation handling, chaining, and utility functions for working with promises in Python.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the input executor, promise resolution values, and internal state variables such as _handlers, _value, _reason, and future.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data flows into promise resolution or rejection handlers, which could execute malicious code if handlers are compromised or maliciously injected.",
  "flows": "Input data (from executor or promise resolution) flows through _resolve_callback, _reject, or _settle_promise methods, which then invoke handlers or fulfill/reject promises, potentially executing user-defined callback functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of deprecated decorators, but not malicious. The code uses dynamic features (e.g., partial, wraps) for promise chaining, which is standard. No signs of obfuscation, hidden network connections, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Promise class with methods for resolving, rejecting, chaining, and utility functions for promise management. It leverages external async utilities and threading constructs but does not include network operations, file manipulation, or system commands that could be malicious. The only notable dynamic feature is the use of callback functions, which is typical for promise implementations. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code flows are evident. The code does not attempt to exfiltrate data or perform unauthorized actions.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a standard implementation of a Promise library in Python, with no indications of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It mainly manages asynchronous flow control in a typical manner without suspicious side effects.",
