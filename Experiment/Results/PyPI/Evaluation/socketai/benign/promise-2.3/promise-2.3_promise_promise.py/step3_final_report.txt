  "purpose": "A Promise implementation in Python following Promises/A+ specification, providing asynchronous control flow with resolution, rejection, and chaining capabilities.",
  "sources": "Executor functions, async/await utilities, internal promise states, and external utility modules.",
  "sinks": "Promise resolution/rejection handlers, callback invocations, and internal state transitions; no external network or file system activity.",
  "flows": "Input data from executor or handlers flows through promise state changes, callback invocations, and resolution/rejection pathways.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, suspicious external calls, obfuscation, or malicious code. Use of deprecated warnings and 'weakref' are benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, comprehensive Promise library implementing Promises/A+ in Python. It manages internal states, callback chains, and supports features like 'then', 'catch', 'all', and 'resolve'. No malicious behaviors such as network activity, data exfiltration, or sabotage are present. The use of external utilities and internal attributes aligns with typical async patterns. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.2) are justified given the code's nature and potential for misuse if handlers are malicious, which is inherent to promise-based systems but not malicious itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured Promise implementation with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No modifications are necessary.",
