  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical consistency, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes a Promise implementation following Promises/A+ in Python, with input from executor, async results, etc.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No suspicious data flows; data propagates through promise resolution/rejection.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code. Use of weakref is benign.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a standard, well-structured Promise library with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Confidence & Scores:** 0.95 confidence, malware score 0, risk 0. The reasoning aligns with the code content.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion and scores are reasonable and well-justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, with focus on promise chaining and external data.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Potential data flow from untrusted inputs into handlers; standard concern with promise systems.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious code or external network activity detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a typical promise implementation; the risk score of 0.2 reflects a low but acknowledged potential for misuse if handlers are malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0.2, confidence 0.9 — consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning and scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above; emphasizes the handling of untrusted data.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Untrusted data could propagate through handlers, but no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The implementation is standard, with external utilities assumed safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0.2, confidence 0.9 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard promise features; data from executor, handlers.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows through promise resolution; standard for promises.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious external calls or secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a typical promise library, with no malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0.2, confidence 0.9 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Well justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same general description; data from executor, handlers.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data could flow into handlers; typical for promise implementations.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious code, no obfuscation, no network activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard promise code, low risk.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0.2, confidence 0.9 — consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity (score 0).\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, matching the code's clarity.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above 0, at 0.2, reflecting potential misuse if handlers are malicious, which is a standard concern in promise systems.\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (standard risk for untrusted handlers in async code)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and reasonable. The code is a legitimate, standard Promise implementation with no malicious intent or sabotage. The scores reflect typical concerns associated with asynchronous promise handling but do not indicate actual malicious activity.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.2   |\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms the code's safety and the appropriateness of the scoring.",
