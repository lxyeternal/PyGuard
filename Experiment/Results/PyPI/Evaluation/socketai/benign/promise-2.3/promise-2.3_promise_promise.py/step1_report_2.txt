{
  "purpose": "This code implements a Promise class following Promises/A+ specification, facilitating asynchronous operations and promise chaining in Python.",
  "sources": "Code reads input from function parameters, internal state variables, class methods, and external modules such as sys, threading, and asyncio-like features.",
  "sinks": "Potential untrusted data flows through promise resolution and rejection handlers, callback invocations, and the handling of futures or coroutine results.",
  "flows": "Sources of data (e.g., executor functions, promise resolution) flow through promise state changes (fulfill, reject) and into callback handlers, which may further resolve or reject other promises, potentially leading to data leaks or malicious actions if handlers are malicious.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external network calls are detected. Usage of deprecated warnings and generic exception handling are present but typical for promise implementations. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a Promise class with support for chaining, resolution, rejection, and converting various asynchronous objects to promises. It uses common Python modules, proper exception handling, and threading mechanisms. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system modification. The only potential concern could be misuse of handlers or untrusted code supplied to then/catch methods, but this is a typical aspect of promise-based systems and not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, standard promise implementation without malicious intent. It does not contain any signs of malware or sabotage, and there are no suspicious external communications or backdoors. The overall security risk is low, assuming handlers provided are trusted by the user.",
