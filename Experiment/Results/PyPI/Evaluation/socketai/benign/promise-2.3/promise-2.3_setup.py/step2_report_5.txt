  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code performs standard setup activities: reading a README file, importing the package to get version info, setting a global attribute, and configuring dependencies. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious logic is evident.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate; no issues found.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, the script follows typical setup patterns. The dynamic import (`__import__('promise')`) is standard for retrieving version info in setup scripts. No external input or untrusted data involved.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct; no malicious activity.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, a standard setup script. The dynamic import is common, and no external data is processed insecurely. The use of `open()` is typical, and no suspicious code is present.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid; no security issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion; the code is typical for a setup script. No external data processing, no network activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with others, standard setup code. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or risky behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; all reports agree.\n- **Risk score:** Given the straightforward nature of the code, the risk is negligible.\n\n**Final assessment:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to account for the dynamic import, but it's standard practice)  \n\nThe code is a typical setup script with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain vulnerabilities. The use of `__import__()` to load the package version is common in setup files and does not indicate malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. No changes needed. The package setup code is benign, with scores appropriately reflecting that.",
