{
  "purpose": "This code sets up and configures a Python package named 'promise', including dependencies, metadata, and compatibility settings.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables and system version info, opens 'README.rst' for reading long description, imports version from 'promise' package.",
  "sinks": "Open function to read 'README.rst'; importing 'promise' module to get version; setting built-in attribute '__SETUP__'.",
  "flows": "Environment info and Python version determine imports; reading 'README.rst' content for long description; importing 'promise' to get version; setting global '__SETUP__' attribute.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'open' to read a file without sanitization; assigning a new attribute '__SETUP__' to builtins; dynamic import of 'promise' module which could be malicious if the package is compromised.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs package setup activities. It reads environment info to conditionally import modules, reads a README file for description, dynamically imports the 'promise' package to get its version, and configures dependencies. The code does not execute untrusted code or include any obfuscated or suspicious logic. The use of 'open' is standard for setup scripts, though it assumes the file exists. Importing 'promise' for version info is typical but depends on the integrity of the package. Setting a global '__SETUP__' attribute in builtins is unusual but not malicious. Overall, the code performs typical setup operations without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It reads files and imports modules for configuration purposes. No malicious activity or sabotage is evident.",
