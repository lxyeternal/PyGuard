  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, code logic, and consistency of scores.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard setup script; no malicious activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Key points:** Reads 'README.rst', imports 'promise' to get version, sets a global attribute in builtins.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent; no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — justified, as no security issues are present.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate. The code is typical for package setup.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard setup; no suspicious behavior.\n- **Key points:** Reads 'README.rst', dynamically imports 'promise' to get version, no external untrusted input.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct assessment; no malicious activity.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, standard setup script; no malicious activity.\n- **Key points:** Uses sys modules, dynamic import for version, reads local README.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid; no security concerns.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Standard package setup, no malicious behavior.\n- **Key points:** Reads local README, imports version, no external data.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct; typical setup code.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same as others; no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Key points:** Reads local README, imports version, no external input.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n- **Risk scores:** All are 0, justified as no security vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The dynamic import of `'promise'` to get version info is standard in setup scripts.\n- Reading 'README.rst' without sanitization is typical; no malicious intent.\n- Setting `__SETUP__` in builtins is unusual but not malicious.\n- No external network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration is present.\n- The code relies on the integrity of the package itself, which is standard.\n\n### Final recommendation:\n- **Malware score:** Keep at 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk:** 0.\n\n**The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.**",
