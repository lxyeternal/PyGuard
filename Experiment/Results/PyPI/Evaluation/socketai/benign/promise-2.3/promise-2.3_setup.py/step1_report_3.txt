{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for the 'promise' Python package, handling environment setup, dependencies, and package metadata.",
  "sources": "sys module for Python version info, __import__('promise') for dynamic import, open('README.rst') for description, hardcoded strings for URL, author info, and keywords.",
  "sinks": "None of the sources directly lead to untrusted data flow or insecure operations; no data is processed from external untrusted sources in a harmful manner.",
  "flows": "sys.version_info and sys.hexversion determine environment; dynamic import retrieves version; open() reads local README file for long_description.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import (__import__('promise')) could be suspicious if not controlled, but here it appears to be a standard pattern for package version retrieval. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment detection and sets up package metadata using standard practices. The dynamic import is used to get the package version, which is common in setup scripts. Reading the README file for long description is typical. No external input is processed that could lead to injection. No suspicious or malicious behavior observed. The dependencies are specified with version constraints, and no runtime data or untrusted sources are involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It follows common patterns for package configuration without exposing vulnerabilities.",
