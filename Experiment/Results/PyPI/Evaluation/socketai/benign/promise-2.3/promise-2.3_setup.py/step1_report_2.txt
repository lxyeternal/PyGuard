{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'promise', including dependencies, metadata, and compatibility information.",
  "sources": "Reads system version info, imports package version dynamically, reads the README file for long description, and gathers dependencies from the environment and package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input data is directly used in a way that could lead to data leaks or security issues. No data is written to external systems, network, or sensitive locations.",
  "flows": "System info → version import → setup configuration → dependencies; README file reading for description.",
  "anomalies": "The use of `__import__` to load the package version dynamically could be a vector for malicious override if the module name or path is manipulated, but as presented, it appears standard. The code reads the README file directly without sanitization, but this is typical for setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally imports built-in modules based on Python version, sets a global variable, dynamically imports the package to retrieve version info, and configures the package setup parameters. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data sources are used insecurely. The code follows standard practices for Python package setup without suspicious patterns or malicious intent. The only minor point is the dynamic import of 'promise', which should be trustworthy as it is part of the package setup process. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears legitimate and standard for packaging a Python library. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation present. The code is straightforward and does not perform any harmful actions.",
