  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'promise', performing configuration and version retrieval.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst' file, system info via sys module, dynamic import of 'promise' for version, sets global attribute in builtins.",
  "sinks": "No external network activity, no data leaks, no untrusted data processing or code execution beyond standard import.",
  "flows": "Reads local files and system info, dynamically imports package for version, sets global attribute, proceeds with setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() without sanitization is typical; setting '__SETUP__' in builtins is unusual but not malicious; dynamic import for version info is common practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It employs standard practices for package configuration, version retrieval, and dependency specification. No suspicious patterns, external communications, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, typical for Python package setup, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise. The scores are consistent with the analysis, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.",
