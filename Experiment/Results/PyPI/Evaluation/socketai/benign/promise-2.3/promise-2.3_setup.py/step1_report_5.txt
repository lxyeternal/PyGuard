{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package named 'promise', intended for distribution and installation via package managers like PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' for long description, importing version info from 'promise' module, reading input from environment variables (e.g., sys.version_info).",
  "sinks": "No direct data leaks or untrusted data handling, no network operations, file writes, or external system calls observed.",
  "flows": "sys.version_info is used to determine Python version; version is imported from 'promise' module; open() reads 'README.rst' for description.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior. Usage of standard setup tools and straightforward code. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a typical setup configuration for a Python package, importing standard modules, setting environment flags, and configuring installation parameters. The import of version info relies on an internal module 'promise'. The code reads a local file 'README.rst' for the long description. It conditionally appends testing dependencies based on the Python version. No external data is fetched or transmitted, no code injection points, and no suspicious patterns are present. Usage of standard libraries and practices suggests this is a legitimate package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It reads local files, imports internal module data, and sets up package metadata in a typical manner. No malicious or suspicious elements are detected.",
