  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** Standard setup script, reads 'README.rst', imports 'promise' to get version, sets a global attribute in builtins.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, typical practices.\n- **Risk/Malware Score:** Both 0.0, which is appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** The logic is sound; no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard setup, dynamically imports 'promise' for version.\n- **Findings:** No external input or untrusted data processed insecurely.\n- **Risk/Malware Score:** Both 0.0, justified.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious intent or vulnerabilities apparent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Standard package setup, uses dynamic import to get version, reads README.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns; dynamic import is common for version retrieval.\n- **Risk/Malware Score:** Both 0.0, consistent.\n- **Assessment:** No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Standard setup script, reads 'README.rst', imports 'promise' for version.\n- **Findings:** No external or untrusted data processed; no suspicious activity.\n- **Risk/Malware Score:** Both 0.0, appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Typical setup, reads local README, imports version.\n- **Findings:** No external data or insecure operations.\n- **Risk/Malware Score:** Both 0.0, justified.\n- **Assessment:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** The code is a standard setup script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or supply chain compromise.\n- **Errors or Flaws:** No logical errors or security flaws are evident. The use of `open()` without sanitization is typical in setup scripts; the dynamic import of the package for version info is common and not malicious.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and risk scores as 0, which aligns with the analysis. No reason to adjust these scores.\n- **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:** None are warranted; the code is straightforward and safe.\n- **Malware Concerns:** No malicious behavior or payloads are indicated.\n- **Assumptions and Claims:** All claims about potential vulnerabilities are based on standard practices; no unwarranted assumptions are made.\n- **Score Consistency:** All reports are consistent with their assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a typical, benign Python package setup script with no signs of malicious or supply chain issues.",
