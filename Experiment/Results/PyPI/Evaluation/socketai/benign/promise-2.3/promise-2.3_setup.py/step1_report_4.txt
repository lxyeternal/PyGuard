{
  "purpose": "This script is designed to set up and configure the packaging of a Python library called 'promise'. It manages dependencies, metadata, and package data for distribution.",
  "sources": "sys (system information), open('README.rst').read() (reading README file), __import__('promise').get_version() (importing package version)",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data or external inputs are directly processed or outputted in a harmful manner",
  "flows": "sys.version_info and sys.hexversion determine environment; open() reads README; __import__('promise').get_version() retrieves version; these influence setup configuration but do not process untrusted data",
  "anomalies": "The use of open('README.rst') without validation could potentially be unsafe if the file contents are malicious, but this is standard practice for setup scripts and unlikely to be malicious itself",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports system modules and the setuptools package for setup. It dynamically imports the 'promise' module to get version info. It sets a built-in flag '__SETUP__' to True, which may be used by the package for environment checks. The setup() function defines package metadata, dependencies, and package data, all typical for a setup script. No external inputs are accepted; no suspicious behavior such as network access, data exfiltration, or code execution is evident. The reading of the README file is standard for including long descriptions. Overall, the script is straightforward, standard for packaging, and contains no malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a conventional package configuration file with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard package setup tasks without processing untrusted data or performing insecure operations.",
