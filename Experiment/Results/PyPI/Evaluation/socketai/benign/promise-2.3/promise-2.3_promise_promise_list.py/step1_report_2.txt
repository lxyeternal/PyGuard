{
  "purpose": "The code defines a PromiseList class that manages a list of promises, handling their resolution and rejection asynchronously, and provides methods for initialization, iteration, and resolution/rejection logic.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the constructor parameter 'values', which can be a collection or promise, and from the promise class methods like is_thenable, _try_convert_to_promise, and the iterable values within _iterate.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leakage points include the handling of promise resolutions/rejections which could, in other contexts, lead to leaking sensitive data if the promises are misused. However, there are no explicit sinks like network or file I/O within this code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input 'values' into promise resolution via _init or _init_promise; within _iterate, each value (or promise) is processed, and upon fulfillment or rejection, the results propagate via callbacks (_promise_fulfilled or _promise_rejected).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The code uses standard promise handling, and all method calls seem consistent with promise management. Commented-out code and type hints indicate attention to correctness but do not suggest malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to implement a standard promise handling mechanism, managing collections of promises with proper fulfillment and rejection logic. The use of partial functions, callbacks, and promise state checks are consistent with asynchronous promise management. There are no indications of malicious code, backdoors, or external communication. The code does not perform any network operations, file I/O, or system commands. The flow from input to promise resolution is straightforward, with proper exception handling and promise state management. No suspicious data handling or potential data leaks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of a promise list handler for asynchronous operations, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears to be a legitimate utility for promise management in asynchronous workflows.",
