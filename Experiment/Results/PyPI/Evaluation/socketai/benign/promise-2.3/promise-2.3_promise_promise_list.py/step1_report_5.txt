{
  "purpose": "This code implements a PromiseList class for managing collections of Promise objects, handling asynchronous resolution and rejection states, and maintaining promise flow control.",
  "sources": "The code reads input values from the constructor parameter 'values', checks if values are thenable, and processes these values through promise conversion methods.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the _reject_callback and _fulfill methods of the promise object, which could be misused if the promise class is malicious or compromised.",
  "flows": "Values are read in the constructor; if thenable, they are converted and initialized via _init_promise; otherwise, processed via _init. During iteration, each value (or promise) flows through _promise_fulfilled or _promise_rejected, which resolve or reject the promise, respectively.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a conditional import of 'Iterable' and an import of 'Promise' within a dead code block ('if False:'). The use of partial functions is typical, but there is no direct malicious anomaly. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or backdoors are evident. The commented-out code hints at potential suppression of unhandled rejections but does not execute.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a Promise handler managing collections of promises with resolve and reject mechanisms. It carefully handles thenable values, manages promise states, and invokes callbacks accordingly. No suspicious or malicious constructs are present. The dead code and commented lines are benign, possibly remnants or placeholders. No obfuscated code or malicious logic was detected. The promise handling and flow control follow expected patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward Promise management class with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It functions to handle collections of promises asynchronously. No malicious intent or security risks are identified based on this code fragment.",
