{
  "purpose": "Implementation of a PromiseList class that manages a collection of promise objects, handling their resolution, rejection, and iteration.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from the constructor parameter 'values', checking if values are thenable, and converting them to promises; internal methods accessing promise states and values.",
  "sinks": "Methods that resolve or reject the promise, such as '_resolve', '_reject', and callbacks attached to thenable objects; potential data leaks if external data is incorporated unsanitized.",
  "flows": "Input 'values' flows through initial checks, promise conversions, iteration, and resolution/rejection logic, with callback functions triggered on promise fulfillment or rejection.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'partial' for callback registration; extensive commented-out code; reliance on promise state checks that could be manipulated if the Promise class is maliciously crafted; no hardcoded secrets or obvious malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to implement a Promise handling utility, managing asynchronous resolution of collections of promises. It performs type checks, promise state management, and callback registration. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The use of 'partial' for callbacks is standard in async code, and no obfuscated constructs or malicious patterns are detected. There is reliance on the Promise class's internal methods and states, which must be trusted, but no malicious behavior within this code itself. Overall, it is a structured promise management class with no signs of malicious intent or malicious code flow.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard PromiseList implementation managing asynchronous promise resolution within a collection. It contains no signs of malware or malicious behavior, functioning as a typical promise handling utility. It does not access or leak sensitive data or execute harmful actions.",
