  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall code review:**\n\n- The code implements a PromiseList class that manages multiple promises, handling their resolution, rejection, and iteration.\n- It relies heavily on the Promise class's internal methods and states, including is_thenable, _try_convert_to_promise, and internal attributes like _value(), _reason(), _add_callbacks, etc.\n- It uses partial functions for callback registration, which is standard in asynchronous code.\n- There are no network calls, file I/O, or data exfiltration mechanisms present.\n- Commented-out code and dead code (e.g., \"if False\" block) are benign and likely remnants or placeholders.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code's purpose appears to be managing asynchronous collections of promises, with proper handling of fulfilled and rejected states.\n\n---\n\n### Issue 1 Review\n\n**Purpose:** The code manages a collection of promises for async operations.\n\n**Sources:** Constructor input, Promise class methods.\n\n**Sinks:** Promise resolution/rejection methods, callback registration.\n\n**Flows:** Input -> promise conversion -> iteration -> resolve/reject.\n\n**Anomalies:** Use of partial, dead code, no malicious patterns.\n\n**Analysis:** Standard promise management; no malicious behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:** Low security risk, no malware.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- SecurityRisk: 0.1 (reasonable, minimal risk)\n\n---\n\n### Issue 2 Review\n\n**Purpose:** Similar to Issue 1, managing promise collection.\n\n**Sources:** Constructor, promise methods.\n\n**Sinks:** Promise resolution/rejection.\n\n**Flows:** Input -> promise conversion -> iteration -> resolution.\n\n**Anomalies:** No suspicious code; reliance on promise internals.\n\n**Analysis:** Standard pattern, no malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:** Very low risk.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- SecurityRisk: 0.2 (still low, acceptable)\n\n---\n\n### Issue 3 Review\n\n**Purpose:** Again, managing promises in a collection.\n\n**Sources:** Input, promise methods.\n\n**Sinks:** Promise fulfill/reject methods.\n\n**Flows:** Input -> promise conversion -> iteration -> resolve/reject.\n\n**Anomalies:** Use of partial, no malicious code, no secrets.\n\n**Analysis:** Typical promise aggregation code.\n\n**Conclusion:** No signs of malware.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- SecurityRisk: 0.2\n\n---\n\n### Issue 4 Review\n\n**Purpose:** Promise collection management.\n\n**Sources:** Constructor, promise methods.\n\n**Sinks:** Promise's internal resolve/reject.\n\n**Flows:** Input -> promise conversion -> iteration -> resolve/reject.\n\n**Anomalies:** Commented-out code, internal attribute access, no malicious patterns.\n\n**Analysis:** Standard promise handling, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:** Safe, typical utility.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- SecurityRisk: 0.2\n\n---\n\n### Issue 5 Review\n\n**Purpose:** Promise collection management.\n\n**Sources:** Constructor, promise methods.\n\n**Sinks:** Promise resolution/rejection.\n\n**Flows:** Input -> promise conversion -> iteration -> resolve/reject.\n\n**Anomalies:** Dead code, commented-out lines, no secrets or obfuscation.\n\n**Analysis:** Standard promise handling, no malicious patterns.\n\n**Conclusion:** No malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- SecurityRisk: 0.1\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate no malicious behavior, which aligns with the code's functionality.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; all scores are 0.\n- **Risk score:** Very low, given the absence of malicious activity, secrets, or external communication.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.1\n\nThe code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a PromiseList utility for managing asynchronous promise collections, with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this conclusion.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured promise management utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk. The scores should remain at 0 for malware and obfuscated, with a very low risk score around 0.1.",
