{
  "purpose": "The code defines a PromiseList class that manages a collection of promises, handling their resolution, rejection, and iteration over values, likely for asynchronous operations.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the constructor parameter 'values' and from the Promise class methods such as is_thenable, _try_convert_to_promise, and internal state variables within Promise objects.",
  "sinks": "Methods like _reject_callback, _fulfill, and _add_callbacks can process untrusted data or errors; the code also potentially handles untrusted promises or values during iteration.",
  "flows": "Input 'values' -> _init / _init_promise -> _iterate -> _promise_fulfilled / _promise_rejected -> final promise resolution or rejection.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses partial, dynamic method calls, and internally manages promise states without validating input types beyond iterable checks. There are no hardcoded credentials, network calls, or suspicious file operations. Some commented-out code is present but not malicious. No obfuscated code features are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a PromiseList that manages multiple promise objects and their resolution flow. It carefully checks for thenable objects and handles asynchronous resolution. No suspicious or malicious patterns such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The only notable behavior is the handling of promises and their states, which is standard for async control flow. No hardcoded secrets or unsafe operations are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of an asynchronous promise handler with no malicious intent. It does not exhibit malware behaviors such as data theft, network communication, or backdoors. The overall security risk is very low.",
