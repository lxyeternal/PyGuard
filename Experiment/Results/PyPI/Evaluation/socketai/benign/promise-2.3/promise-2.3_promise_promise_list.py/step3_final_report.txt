  "purpose": "Manages a collection of promises, handling their resolution, rejection, and iteration.",
  "sources": "Input 'values' parameter, internal Promise class methods and attributes.",
  "sinks": "Promise resolution and rejection methods (_fulfill, _reject_callback), callback registration (_then, _add_callbacks).",
  "flows": "Input values -> convert to promises if thenable -> iterate over values -> resolve or reject based on promise states.",
  "anomalies": "Use of internal Promise attributes (_*), commented-out code, dead code block ('if False'), reliance on external Promise class internals.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard PromiseList utility for managing multiple promises, with typical promise handling patterns. It relies on internal Promise methods and attributes, which could be risky if the Promise class is malicious, but the code itself does not contain malicious logic. No network, file I/O, or data exfiltration is present. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are detected. The use of partial functions and internal attributes is typical in promise management but warrants trust in the Promise implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard promise collection handler with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The primary concern is external trust in the Promise class. The security risk is minimal, and malware likelihood is zero.",
