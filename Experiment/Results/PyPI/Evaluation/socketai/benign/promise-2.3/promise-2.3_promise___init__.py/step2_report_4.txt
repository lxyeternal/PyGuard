  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Behavior:**\n   - All reports conclude that the code is benign, standard package initialization code.\n   - The code only performs version setting and conditional imports from internal modules.\n   - No external data processing, dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious constructs are present.\n   - The use of the `__SETUP__` variable is a common pattern for build-time configuration, not malicious.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - The code appears correct and follows standard practices.\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n   - The try-except block for `__SETUP__` is a typical pattern to handle build-time variables.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0 or very low (0.1), which aligns with the analysis—no significant security risk.\n\n4. **Potential Assumptions or Claims:**\n   - Some reports mention the use of `__SETUP__` as a build-time variable, which is standard.\n   - No assumptions about external inputs or behaviors are made that could lead to false positives.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - Given the evidence, no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risk evident.\n\n**Final Justification:**\n\nThe code is a typical, benign package initialization script. It manages versioning and conditional imports based on a build-time variable. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned by the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | My Estimate | Rationale                                                                                 |\n|------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0            | No malicious activity or suspicious behavior present.                                   |\n| Obfuscated       | 0            | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation detected.                                       |\n| Security Risk    | 0            | No vulnerabilities or risky behaviors identified.                                       |\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms the code's benign and standard nature.",
