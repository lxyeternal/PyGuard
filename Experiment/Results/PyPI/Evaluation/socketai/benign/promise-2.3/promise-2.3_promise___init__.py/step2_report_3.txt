  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a standard package initialization script, with no suspicious or malicious behavior. The use of `__SETUP__` is typical for build-time configuration, and no external data processing or dynamic code execution is present.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. This aligns with the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues, benign code.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, it describes the code as a typical setup script managing versioning and conditional imports. No external data flows or suspicious constructs.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Matches the benign assessment.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, the code is described as a standard package setup, with no external input processing or malicious behavior. The use of `__SETUP__` is routine.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. The small security risk score is acceptable given the standard pattern.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports, standard initialization with conditional imports based on build-time variables. No suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. No issues.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard code.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—standard package setup with no external data handling or suspicious constructs.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. No concerns.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected in any report.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, as expected for a package initialization script. The small risk scores (0.1) are reasonable.\n\n### Critical Analysis:\n- The code is a straightforward, standard package setup script.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or external data processing.\n- The use of `__SETUP__` is a common pattern for build-time control, not suspicious.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious intent.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (or possibly 0, but 0.1 is acceptable given the context)\n\nThis assessment aligns with the detailed reviews and the nature of the code.\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, standard, and free from malicious or obfuscated content. The minor security risk score is acceptable and does not indicate any real concern.",
