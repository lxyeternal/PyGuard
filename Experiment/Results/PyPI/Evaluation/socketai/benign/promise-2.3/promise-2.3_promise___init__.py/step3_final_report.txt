  "purpose": "Standard package initialization script managing version info and conditional imports based on build-time variable.",
  "sources": "Build-time injected variable __SETUP__, internal modules (.promise, .schedulers.immediate), get_version function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external sources; no data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No external input flows to sensitive functions or data leaks; import flow is static and controlled.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __SETUP__ is typical for build configuration; no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package setup script. It uses a build-time variable __SETUP__ to control conditional imports, which is a common pattern. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or external data processing is present. The imports are from internal modules, and the version is set statically. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package initialization script with no malicious intent or security risks. The use of __SETUP__ is a typical build pattern, not suspicious. All assessments and scores are justified and accurate.",
