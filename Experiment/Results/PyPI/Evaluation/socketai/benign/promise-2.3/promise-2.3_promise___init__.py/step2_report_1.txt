  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It is a typical package initialization script.\n- Uses a build-time injected variable `__SETUP__` to control import behavior.\n- Sets version info.\n- Imports internal modules (`.promise`, `.schedulers.immediate`) and exposes certain functions/classes.\n- No dynamic code execution, external data processing, or obfuscation.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Standard package setup.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: No untrusted data or suspicious data flow.\n- Anomalies: Common pattern, no obfuscation.\n- Analysis: Straightforward, no malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Safe, benign.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: No external untrusted sources involved.\n- Anomalies: Use of `__SETUP__` is standard.\n- Analysis: No malicious activity, standard package setup.\n- Conclusion: Safe.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Similar, setting up promises and schedulers.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: No untrusted data flow.\n- Anomalies: Use of build-time variable `__SETUP__` is typical.\n- Analysis: No dynamic code, no malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Safe.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0.1 (slightly above zero but justified as very low risk, perhaps due to the build-time variable pattern)\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly elevated securityRisk score, but justified. No malware detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: No external untrusted data.\n- Anomalies: Use of `__SETUP__` is standard, no obfuscation.\n- Analysis: Typical package setup pattern.\n- Conclusion: Safe.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Similar setup with promise modules.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: No untrusted data or suspicious flow.\n- Anomalies: Use of build-time variable is common.\n- Analysis: No malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Safe.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### General observations:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard package initialization script.\n- No evidence of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or data leaks.\n- The only slight concern is the use of `__SETUP__`, which is a common pattern in build scripts, not inherently suspicious.\n- The malware scores are appropriately zero across all reports.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### **My conclusion:**\n\nBased on the code and reports, the package appears entirely benign. The use of build-time variables and internal imports is standard practice, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments.
