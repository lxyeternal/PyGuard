{
  "purpose": "This code initializes version information and conditionally imports asynchronous programming utilities and schedulers for a larger Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the '__SETUP__' variable (via built-in scope) and imports modules such as '.promise' and '.schedulers.immediate'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no external data is processed or written.",
  "flows": "The flow involves checking '__SETUP__' status, then importing modules if not in setup mode, and defining public API.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a build-in injected variable '__SETUP__' to control import behavior is somewhat unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a typical module initialization pattern. It uses a build-time injected variable to conditionally import submodules, which is common in complex package setups. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious patterns are evident. The imported modules seem related to asynchronous programming, with no indication of malicious behavior. The code's structure is straightforward, and no anomalies suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup and import module for a larger package, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
