{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module initialization script for a package, setting version information and importing submodules related to promises and schedulers.",
  "sources": "Reads version tuple, imports functions and classes from internal modules.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "Imports from internal modules (promise, schedulers), which are likely trusted if the package is legitimate.",
  "anomalies": "The use of the '__SETUP__' variable is a common pattern for build-time configuration; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs are present. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports are observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles package setup and conditional imports. The '__SETUP__' variable is used to control whether submodules are imported, depending on the build state. The version information is static, and imports are from internal modules, which are presumed to be part of the package. No external data is processed, and no network or system modification operations are present. Overall, the code appears to be a standard, benign package initialization script with no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package initialization file with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It handles versioning and imports internal modules safely. No suspicious or malicious activity detected.",
