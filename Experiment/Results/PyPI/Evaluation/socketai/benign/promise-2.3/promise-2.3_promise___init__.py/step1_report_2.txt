{
  "purpose": "This code sets up version information and conditionally imports various promise-related modules and schedulers for a Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the built-in variable __SETUP__, the get_version function, and local modules (.promise and .schedulers.immediate).",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or code execution; imports are from local modules and do not involve external untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "The flow involves checking the __SETUP__ variable, then conditionally importing modules and assigning __all__, without handling untrusted input or executing dynamic code.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a build-in variable __SETUP__ injected during build time, which is a common pattern in package setup scripts. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are present. No obfuscation or obfuscated code features are observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily manages versioning and conditional importing of package components, based on the build environment indicated by __SETUP__. It does not process external input, execute dynamic code, or include any suspicious behavior. The variable __SETUP__ is used to prevent certain imports during setup, which is standard practice. No malware indicators such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code appears straightforward and typical for a Python package initialization module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup and import script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply manages conditional imports based on the build environment. Overall, it appears safe and free from malware.",
