{
  "purpose": "This code appears to set up version information and conditionally import promise-related modules and schedulers for asynchronous programming.",
  "sources": "The code reads version information from a version tuple, and imports modules and functions based on the __SETUP__ variable. The only external input could be from the __SETUP__ variable or the get_version() function, which is imported.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or output, such as network or file operations. No untrusted data handling is visible.",
  "flows": "The flow involves setting version info, checking __SETUP__, then importing modules and functions accordingly. No external data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present. The code includes a comment about a build-time variable, which is typical for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes version info, uses a build-time injected variable __SETUP__ to determine whether to import certain modules, and sets __all__ for exports. The __SETUP__ variable is used to control import behavior and is protected with a try-except block. The get_version() function is imported from a local module and is used to set __version__. The overall structure is standard for a package setup or module initialization script, with no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup script that manages versioning and conditional imports. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies are detected.",
