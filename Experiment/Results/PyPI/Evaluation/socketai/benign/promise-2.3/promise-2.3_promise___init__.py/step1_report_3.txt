{
  "purpose": "This source code appears to set up and expose functions and classes related to asynchronous programming, promises, and schedulers in a Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads a version tuple (VERSION) and a build-injected variable (__SETUP__), as well as imports from internal modules (.pyutils.version, .promise, .schedulers.immediate).",
  "sinks": "The code imports and exposes functions and classes, but no untrusted data flows or data sinks are present that could lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "The code initializes version info, conditionally imports modules based on __SETUP__, and exposes API functions and classes. No flow of untrusted input to sensitive operations is detected.",
  "anomalies": "The use of a build-injected variable (__SETUP__) is a common pattern in build processes and not suspicious. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages versioning and conditional imports for package setup. The __SETUP__ variable is used to control import behavior, which is standard. The module imports functions related to promises and schedulers, but these are just exposed for public use and do not execute untrusted code or perform malicious actions. No data leaks, code injections, or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a typical package initialization script with standard build-time and runtime behaviors. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. The use of internal modules and the __SETUP__ flag is consistent with normal package design.",
