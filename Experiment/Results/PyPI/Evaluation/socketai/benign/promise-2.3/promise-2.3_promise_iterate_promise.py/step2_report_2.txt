  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and the associated code snippets.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe a similar pattern: a generator function that checks if a Promise is fulfilled, yields from its future if not, then asserts fulfillment before returning the result.\n- The code is encapsulated within an `if False:` block, which makes it inactive during execution.\n- No evidence of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious external calls.\n- Use of `assert` statements is standard but can be disabled; however, this is common in Python and not inherently malicious.\n- The `Promise` class and its methods (`is_fulfilled`, `future`, `get()`) are used without context, but nothing suspicious is implied.\n- The reports uniformly assign high confidence (0.9 or 1.0) that the code is benign, with malware scores at 0.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Findings:\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears syntactically correct and implements a typical Promise handling pattern.\n- **Malicious activity:** No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data flows.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation detected.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, primarily due to the inactive `if False:` block and standard pattern usage.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Points:\n- The `if False:` block suggests the code is inactive or used for type hints or documentation. This does not introduce security concerns.\n- The use of `assert` could be a minor concern if assertions are disabled in production, but this is a common practice and not malicious.\n- No external data sources, network calls, or untrusted input handling is present.\n- The `promise.get()` could theoretically leak sensitive data if `Promise` is misused, but this is a typical pattern and not evidence of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Scores and Justification:\n- **Malware score:** Remains at 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Given the low likelihood of issues, a score of 0.1 is reasonable, aligning with the reports.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The reports' assessments are consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- No changes needed to the scores; they accurately reflect the findings.\n- The high confidence scores are justified based on the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThe code appears to be a standard Promise utility with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The inactive code within `if False:` is benign and likely used for development or type hinting.\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, standard, and free from malicious intent. The scores are appropriate and should remain as reported.",
