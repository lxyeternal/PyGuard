{
  "purpose": "The code defines a generator function to iterate over a Promise object if it is not fulfilled, and then retrieves the value once fulfilled.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'is_fulfilled' attribute and 'future' attribute of the 'promise' object, and calls 'promise.get()'.",
  "sinks": "Calls 'promise.get()', which may return data; no explicit untrusted sink but potential data exposure depends on 'Promise' implementation.",
  "flows": "Checks 'promise.is_fulfilled'; if false, yields from 'promise.future', then asserts fulfillment, and finally returns 'promise.get()'.",
  "anomalies": "The code is encapsulated within an 'if False' block, rendering it inactive; no suspicious hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code; reliance on 'Promise' class methods without context is typical.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of an asynchronous pattern using a Promise-like object. It performs a conditional check on 'is_fulfilled', yields from a 'future' if not yet fulfilled, then asserts that 'promise' is fulfilled before retrieving its value. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks. The code structure and usage are typical of asynchronous handling. The 'if False' block suggests this code is inactive or placeholder, which might be used for conditional debugging or development purposes but does not introduce malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no malicious intent or security risks. It implements a standard promise-handling pattern and does not exhibit obfuscation or malicious behaviors. The inactive 'if False' wrapper indicates it's possibly unused or for development only.",
