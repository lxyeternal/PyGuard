{
  "purpose": "The code defines a generator function to iterate over a Promise object, yielding its future if not fulfilled, then asserting fulfillment and returning the result.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'promise' parameter, accesses 'promise.is_fulfilled', 'promise.future', and 'promise.get()' methods.",
  "sinks": "Returns the value obtained from 'promise.get()' after assertion.",
  "flows": "Input 'promise' is checked for fulfillment, then possibly yields from 'promise.future', and finally returns 'promise.get()'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious constructs. The code structure is straightforward with no obfuscation. The import inside the 'if False' block is benign and does not execute.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple generator function that interacts with a Promise-like object. It performs a check on 'promise.is_fulfilled', yields 'promise.future' if not fulfilled, then asserts that the promise is fulfilled, and returns the result of 'promise.get()'. There are no input sources that accept untrusted external data, nor are there any sinks that leak data or perform unsafe actions. The import statements are inactive due to 'if False' and pose no security risk. Overall, the code appears standard and does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard Python code for working with promise-like objects. No malicious intent, no suspicious data flow, and no security risks detected.",
