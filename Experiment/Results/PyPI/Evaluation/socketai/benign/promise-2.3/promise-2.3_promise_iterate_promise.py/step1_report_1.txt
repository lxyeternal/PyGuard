  "purpose": "Function to iterate over a Promise object if not fulfilled, then retrieve its value.",
  "sources": "Reads 'promise.is_fulfilled', 'promise.future', and 'promise.get()'.",
  "sinks": "Returns the value from 'promise.get()'. No direct data sinks or output points involving untrusted input are evident.",
  "flows": "Checks 'promise.is_fulfilled' -> yields from 'promise.future' if not fulfilled -> asserts 'promise.is_fulfilled' -> returns 'promise.get()'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. Use of 'assert' for logic control is typical but can be exploited if assertions are disabled, though this is common practice.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to handle Promise objects, checking if they are fulfilled, iterating over their 'future' if not, then returning the fulfilled value. The initial 'if False:' block is a no-op and does not execute, possibly used to disable imports or for documentation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious data flow. The use of 'assert' could be a minor concern if assertions are disabled in production, but this is standard Python practice and not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward utility for Promise handling without malicious intent. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors identified. The presence of a disabled import block is benign and likely for development purposes.",
