{
  "purpose": "The code defines a function to iterate over a Promise object, yielding its future if not fulfilled, and returning its value when fulfilled.",
  "sources": "The function reads the 'promise' object and accesses its attributes 'is_fulfilled', 'future', and method 'get()'.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leakage if 'promise.get()' exposes sensitive data; no external data or network operations present.",
  "flows": "If 'promise' is not fulfilled, yields from 'promise.future', then asserts fulfillment, and finally returns 'promise.get()'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious external calls. The use of 'assert' could be a concern if assertions are disabled in production.",
  "analysis": "The code is simple and straightforward, handling a Promise-like object. It checks fulfillment status, yields the future if not fulfilled, then asserts the promise is fulfilled and returns its value. No external data sources or sinks, no malicious code behaviors detected. The 'assert' statement could be a point of failure if assertions are disabled, but it is not malicious per se.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a utility to work with Promise objects. No malicious behavior or malicious intent is detected. The code's structure is normal, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
