  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n**Overall code review:**\n- The code defines a function `iterate_promise` that checks if a Promise object is fulfilled, yields from its `future` if not, then asserts fulfillment, and finally returns the result of `promise.get()`.\n- The code is wrapped in an `if False:` block, making it inactive; this is likely for development or documentation purposes.\n- The code appears straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data leaks.\n- The use of `assert` could be a minor concern if assertions are disabled in production, but this is standard Python practice.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n**Summary:**\n- No malicious behavior detected.\n- Uses `assert` for control flow.\n- No suspicious data flow.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1\n\n**Evaluation:**\n- The reasoning is sound; the code is benign.\n- The low security risk score is appropriate.\n- Malware score is correctly 0.\n- The assertion concern is minor and acknowledged.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n**Summary:**\n- Similar to Report 1.\n- No malicious activity.\n- The code is inactive (`if False:`).\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1\n\n**Evaluation:**\n- The reasoning is consistent.\n- No issues with the scores.\n- No suspicious behavior.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n**Summary:**\n- Same pattern.\n- No malicious intent.\n- The `if False:` block is inactive.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1\n\n**Evaluation:**\n- The assessment is accurate.\n- The code is benign.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n**Summary:**\n- Similar to previous reports.\n- No malicious behavior.\n- The `assert` statement is noted but not considered malicious.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2 (slightly higher, but justified due to the `assert`)\n\n**Evaluation:**\n- The reasoning aligns with the code.\n- The slightly higher security risk score is justified given the `assert`, but still low overall.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n**Summary:**\n- Same overall conclusion.\n- The `if False:` block is dead code, likely for type hints.\n- No malicious behavior.\n- Confidence: 1.0\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Evaluation:**\n- The assessment is thorough and accurate.\n- The code is benign.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Cross-Check:\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, with no malicious activity.\n- The `malware` scores are all 0, which is appropriate.\n- The `obfuscated` scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- The `securityRisk` scores are low, justified by the use of `assert` and dead code, but not indicative of real risk.\n\n### My Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is clear.\n- **Risk score:** Given the use of `assert` and dead code, a small risk score (around 0.1) is justified, but overall, the code is low risk.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Keep the malware and obfuscated scores at 0.\n- Maintain a very low security risk score (~0.1) due to the `assert`.\n- The code is a harmless Promise utility with no malicious intent.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No modifications needed; the code is safe.\n- The scores are appropriate, with no evidence of malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nI agree with the reports' assessments. The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated behavior, and the scores reflect that accurately.",
