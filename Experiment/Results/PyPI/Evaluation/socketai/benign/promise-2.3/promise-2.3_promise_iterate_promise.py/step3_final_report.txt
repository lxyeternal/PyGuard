{
  "purpose": "A simple Promise handler that yields from the promise's future if not fulfilled, then asserts fulfillment and returns the result.",
  "sources": "Reads 'promise.is_fulfilled', 'promise.future', and 'promise.get()'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially 'promise.get()' if it leaks sensitive data, but typical in Promise patterns.",
  "flows": "Checks 'is_fulfilled' -> yields from 'future' if not -> asserts 'is_fulfilled' -> returns 'get()'.",
  "anomalies": "The entire code is within an 'if False:' block, making it inactive; no suspicious external calls or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Promise utility function with no malicious behavior. It checks fulfillment, yields if pending, asserts fulfillment, and returns the result. The inactive 'if False:' block suggests it's used for type hints or documentation, not execution. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The use of 'assert' is standard but could be disabled; however, this does not indicate malicious intent. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions confirm its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign Promise handling utility with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The inactive code block is harmless. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
