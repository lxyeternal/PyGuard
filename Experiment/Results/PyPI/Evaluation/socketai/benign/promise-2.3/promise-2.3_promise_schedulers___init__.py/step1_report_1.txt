  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to perform some form of data processing, possibly involving network communication or data manipulation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, function parameters, or external files. Specific data sources are not clearly identifiable without the actual code content.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file writes, or data transmission functions where untrusted data could leak or cause harm.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or input functions through processing functions to sinks like network transmission or file outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are detected based on the description. Without actual code, detailed anomalies cannot be confirmed.",
  "analysis": "The analysis indicates that the code involves standard data handling and processing routines. No suspicious or malicious patterns such as dynamic code execution, backdoors, or covert data exfiltration are evident from the description. The structure appears typical for a Python package module, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The security risk seems low, and there are no immediate red flags for malware. However, without explicit code content, some details cannot be fully assessed.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided information and analysis, the code appears benign with no evident malicious behavior or security issues. It likely serves its intended purpose without introducing risks. Confidence is moderate due to limited code details.",
  "confidence": 0.6,
  "obfuscated": 0,
