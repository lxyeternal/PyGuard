  "purpose": "Evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Code input, functions like eval/exec, hardcoded secrets, network connections, environment variables, data handling points.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network transmissions, dynamic code execution points, file modifications, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or environment variables to sinks like network or file operations, possibly via dynamic execution or obfuscated code.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicion of obfuscation (e.g., eval, exec), dynamic code, unusual variable names, lack of code detail, inconsistent scores, absence of code in some reports.",
  "analysis": "Most reports indicate benign code with low malware and obfuscation scores, consistent confidence levels, and low security risk. Report 5 suggests suspicion of obfuscation and dynamic execution but lacks concrete code, leading to cautious scoring. Adjustments recommend lowering malware suspicion in report 5 to reflect the absence of explicit malicious activity, and moderating obfuscation suspicion. Overall, scores are aligned with descriptions, with minor conservative modifications for consistency.",
  "conclusion": "The provided reports generally reflect benign code with appropriate risk assessments. Minor score adjustments for report 5 improve consistency, but overall, the supply chain security posture appears low risk. No significant malicious indicators are confirmed; the assessments are reasonable and cautious where suspicion exists.",
