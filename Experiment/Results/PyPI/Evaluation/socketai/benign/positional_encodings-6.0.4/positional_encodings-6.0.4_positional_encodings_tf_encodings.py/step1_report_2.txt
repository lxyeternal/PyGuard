  "purpose": "The code implements sinusoidal positional encoding layers for 1D, 2D, and 3D tensors, likely for use in transformer models or similar architectures to incorporate positional information.",
  "sources": "Input tensors to the 'call' methods of each positional encoding class; these are the primary data sources.",
  "sinks": "Outputs of the 'call' methods which return positional encodings added to the input tensors; no external data sinks or network communications are present.",
  "flows": "Input tensors flow into positional encoding functions, which generate embeddings and add them to the original tensors, returning the enhanced tensors.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard implementation of sinusoidal positional encoding, with no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious external calls. No network operations, file I/O, or secret storage are present. Usage of tf.repeat, tf.tile, and get_emb is consistent with normal positional encoding procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple classes for generating sinusoidal positional encodings in 1D, 2D, and 3D, using TensorFlow layers. It includes utility functions to generate embeddings via sine and cosine functions and applies these to generate positional embeddings based on tensor dimensions. The layers are used to produce position-aware tensors for models. The implementation is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior such as network access, data exfiltration, backdoors, or hardcoded credentials. The code does not execute external commands, write files, or perform suspicious operations. It only computes mathematical embeddings for positional encoding, which is a common technique in neural network models.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard implementation of sinusoidal positional encodings with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It is focused solely on mathematical operations for embedding positional information into tensors, with no signs of malware, data leaks, or sabotage. The overall security risk is very low, and the code is safe for use in machine learning pipelines.",
