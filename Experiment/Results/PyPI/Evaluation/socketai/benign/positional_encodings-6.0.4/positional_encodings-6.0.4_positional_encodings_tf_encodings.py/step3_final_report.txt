  "purpose": "Implementation of sinusoidal positional encodings for 1D, 2D, and 3D tensors, used in neural network models to incorporate positional information.",
  "sources": "Tensor inputs in the call methods (inputs.shape), range tensors (tf.range), and internal functions like get_emb that generate sine and cosine embeddings.",
  "sinks": "No external data sources, network calls, or data leaks; the code performs purely mathematical tensor operations.",
  "flows": "Input tensors are processed through positional encoding functions which generate embeddings via sine and cosine functions, then added to the original tensors in the TFSummer layer.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code is straightforward and matches standard positional encoding implementations.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard sinusoidal positional encodings across multiple dimensions, utilizing common tensor operations such as tf.einsum, tf.tile, tf.repeat, and sine/cosine functions. Shape checks ensure correct tensor dimensions. No external communication, data exfiltration, or malicious logic is present. The implementation aligns with well-known practices in transformer models. All signals indicate benign, transparent, and standard code with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of positional encodings for neural networks, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned in all reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
