  "purpose": "Implementation of positional encoding modules (1D, 2D, 3D) with caching and permutation support for neural network inputs.",
  "sources": "Tensor inputs of shapes (batch_size, x, ch), (batch_size, x, y, ch), (batch_size, x, y, z, ch), and their permuted variants.",
  "sinks": "Outputs are tensors with added positional encodings; no external data, network activity, or data exfiltration detected.",
  "flows": "Input tensors are processed through sinusoidal embedding functions, cached, and added to original tensors via Summer class.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns identified. Caching is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard sinusoidal positional encoding techniques across 1D, 2D, and 3D data, with caching mechanisms to optimize repeated computations. No external data sources, network activity, or malicious behaviors are present. The implementation is clear, well-structured, and uses common tensor operations. No obfuscation or malicious intent is evident. The caching buffers are used appropriately, and the sinusoidal functions are standard in positional encoding modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of positional encoding modules for neural networks, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting the safe and typical nature of this code.",
