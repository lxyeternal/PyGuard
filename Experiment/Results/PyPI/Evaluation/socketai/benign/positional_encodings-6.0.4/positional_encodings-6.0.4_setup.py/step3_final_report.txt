  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for the 'positional_encodings' Python package, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, package discovery via setuptools.find_packages(), and dependency declarations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks; setup.py primarily handles package metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "Reading README content -> passing metadata to setuptools.setup() -> package installation process.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and typical for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup.py script with no suspicious or malicious elements. All reports are empty, providing no evidence of vulnerabilities, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The package dependencies are standard, and no unusual patterns or secrets are present. Given the lack of claims or issues, the code appears benign. Scores for malware, obfuscation, and risk should be zero or near zero, consistent with the absence of evidence.",
  "conclusion": "The package setup code is standard and appears safe. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected. The empty reports do not suggest any issues. Therefore, the malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and risk score is 0.1 to reflect minimal inherent risk without evidence.",
