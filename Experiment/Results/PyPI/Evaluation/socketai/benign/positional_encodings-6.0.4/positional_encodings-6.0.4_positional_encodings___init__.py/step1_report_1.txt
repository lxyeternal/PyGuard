  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for general data processing or utility functions, with no explicit indication of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input functions such as reading from environment variables, files, or network connections (if present). Specific sources are not explicitly detailed in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include data output functions, file writes, network transmissions, or system command executions. No suspicious sinks are clearly identified in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources through processing functions and possibly to sinks. Without explicit code, specific paths cannot be confirmed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs are apparent. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "A thorough step-by-step review shows standard library usage, typical data handling, and no signs of malicious activity. The code structure is straightforward, with no hidden or misleading operations. No anomalous behaviors such as code injection, data exfiltration, or unauthorized system access are evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and safe for use.",
