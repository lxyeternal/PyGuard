{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a utility or module related to data processing or configuration, but without specific context, its primary purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Reads data from environment variables, configuration files, or input parameters; potentially also from network sources if present.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes to files, sends data over network sockets, or executes system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or input to sinks like network transmission or file writing, possibly through processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or backdoors detected. The code uses dynamic imports or eval-like functions which could be suspicious if misused, but no evidence is present here.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious constructs. It does not contain hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity. Usage of environment variables and standard library functions suggests typical data handling. No external network connections or file modifications indicating malware. The structure is clear and typical of benign utility scripts.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code shows no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears to be a benign module with standard data processing functionality.",
