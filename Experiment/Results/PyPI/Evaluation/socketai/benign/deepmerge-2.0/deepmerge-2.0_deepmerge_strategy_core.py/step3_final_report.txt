  "purpose": "Manage and apply a list of merge strategies, either by name or function, during configuration merging.",
  "sources": "String strategy names, class method attributes, strategy function arguments",
  "sinks": "Invocation of strategy functions during __call__, potential execution of untrusted code",
  "flows": "Strategy name or function -> _expand_strategy -> stored in _strategies -> invoked sequentially in __call__",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic attribute access for strategy resolution; no suspicious code or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines a StrategyList class that manages strategies for merging configurations. Strategies can be specified as strings (mapped to class methods) or as functions. During execution, each strategy is called in sequence until one returns a value other than STRATEGY_END. The code uses standard patterns like hasattr and getattr for dynamic method resolution, with appropriate exception handling. No external network activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The main security concern is the execution of potentially malicious strategies supplied externally, which is outside the code's scope. The code itself is benign, well-structured, and free of vulnerabilities or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for managing merge strategies with no inherent malicious behavior. External risks depend on the trustworthiness of supplied strategies. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting external strategy trust issues. Overall, the implementation is secure and appropriate for its purpose.",
