{
  "purpose": "Defines a StrategyList class for managing and applying merging strategies in the deepmerge library, including dynamic strategy resolution.",
  "sources": "Imports external modules (sys, typing, deepmerge, custom exception), and class attributes/methods that access class methods and attributes.",
  "sinks": "Calls to potentially external strategy functions stored in self._strategies list, and dynamic attribute access for strategy resolution.",
  "flows": "Initialization resolves strategies (possibly string to function), __call__ executes each strategy in sequence, returning on first non-STRATEGY_END value.",
  "anomalies": "Uses string-based dynamic method resolution for strategies; no hardcoded secrets, no external network access, no obfuscated code, no suspicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a mechanism to handle merge strategies dynamically, resolving string identifiers to class methods. It imports standard and third-party modules, with no indication of malicious behavior. The core functionality involves strategy resolution and application without executing untrusted code or performing any suspicious operations. The dynamic method resolution is a common pattern and does not suggest malicious intent. No embedded backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are evident. The code appears to be legitimate utility code for handling strategies in a merge library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation for managing and applying strategies in a merge context. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are present. The code is well-structured, with no suspicious or malicious logic detected.",
