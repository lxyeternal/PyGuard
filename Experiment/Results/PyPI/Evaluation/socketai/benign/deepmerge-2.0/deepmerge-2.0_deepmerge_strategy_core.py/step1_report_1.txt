{
  "purpose": "This code defines a StrategyList class for managing and applying a list of merging strategies, either specified by name or function, in a deep merge process.",
  "sources": "Imports modules, especially 'sys', 'typing', and 'deepmerge.merger'; reads attributes and methods from the class and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Calls to strategy functions within __call__, potential exception raising (StrategyNotFound, InvalidMerge), and dynamic attribute access for strategy resolution.",
  "flows": "Strategies are expanded from strings or functions, stored in a list, then invoked sequentially during the __call__ method, with return values checked for STRATEGY_END.",
  "anomalies": "Uses string-based dynamic method resolution for strategies; raises custom exceptions; no hardcoded credentials or sensitive info. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical implementation of strategy pattern for merging configurations, utilizing dynamic method lookups and exception handling. No external data inputs or unsafe operations are evident. The only potential concern is dynamic attribute access for strategies, but it relies on predefined class methods. No malicious behavior or sabotage is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate component for managing merge strategies with no signs of malicious intent. It relies on standard practices and does not perform any harmful actions. The overall security risk is minimal.",
