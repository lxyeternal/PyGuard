  "purpose": "Defines a class for managing and executing a list of merging strategies, resolving strategy names to functions, and applying them in sequence.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, and deepmerge.merger modules; uses class attributes and methods; reads strategy list input during initialization; reads attributes and methods for strategy resolution.",
  "sinks": "Calls strategy functions stored in self._strategies; raises exceptions based on strategy resolution failures or invalid merges.",
  "flows": "Initialization of StrategyList with strategies → strategy resolution via _expand_strategy → invoking strategies in __call__ method → exception handling if no strategy matches or returns STRATEGY_END.",
  "anomalies": "Use of string annotations to avoid circular imports; dynamic resolution of strategy methods based on string names; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; no suspicious external network activity; no use of eval, exec, or similar code execution functions.",
  "analysis": "The code manages a list of strategies for merging configurations, allowing for dynamic resolution of strategy names to methods. It raises specific exceptions if strategies are not found or if merging fails. No data leaks, external communications, or suspicious behaviors are present. The use of string annotations is standard to prevent circular imports, and all method calls are internal. No malware indicators such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code are detected. The code appears to be a normal utility component within a larger configuration management library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for handling strategy resolution and execution with no signs of malicious behavior. It is well-structured and does not contain any malicious code or security risks.",
