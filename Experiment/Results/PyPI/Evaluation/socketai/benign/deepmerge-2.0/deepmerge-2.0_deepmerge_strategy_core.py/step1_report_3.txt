{
  "purpose": "Defines a class for handling a list of merge strategies, allowing dynamic resolution of strategies by name or function and applying them sequentially during a merge process.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (sys, typing, deepmerge.merger, local exception module), class constructor, and class methods that reference string identifiers for strategies.",
  "sinks": "Potentially any call to user-provided functions stored as strategies, especially if those functions are malicious or maliciously crafted to perform harmful actions when invoked during the merge.",
  "flows": "Strategies (which can be user-supplied functions) are called during the __call__ method, which could execute malicious code if such functions are malicious.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic present. The code uses dynamic method resolution for strategies, which could be risky if untrusted strategies are provided. However, this is a common pattern for plugin-like systems.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a class to manage strategies for merging configurations, with dynamic resolution of strategies by name, and executes strategies sequentially. The use of 'hasattr' and dynamic method lookup for strategies does not inherently contain malicious behavior, but it does execute functions that could be provided externally, posing a potential security risk if untrusted code is used as strategies. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or malicious payloads. The code itself is standard and appears benign, but it could execute malicious functions if malicious strategies are supplied at runtime.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for handling merge strategies with dynamic resolution and execution. It does not contain malicious code itself but could invoke malicious functions if such strategies are supplied by an attacker. The overall security risk depends on the trustworthiness of the strategies provided. No malicious behavior or supply chain attacks are evident in this code snippet.",
