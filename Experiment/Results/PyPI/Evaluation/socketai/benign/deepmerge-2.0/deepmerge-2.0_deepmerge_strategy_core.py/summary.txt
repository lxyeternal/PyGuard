  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for managing merge strategies with no inherent malicious behavior. External risks depend on the trustworthiness of supplied strategies. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting external strategy trust issues. Overall, the implementation is secure and appropriate for its purpose."
