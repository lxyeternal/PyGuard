  "purpose": "This code defines a class SetStrategies that provides set merging strategies for use with the deepmerge library, including union, intersection, and override.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads external input or data sources; all data comes from function parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or potential data leaks; functions simply perform set operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable as there are no untrusted data flows or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a class with static methods for set operations. The methods perform standard set operations: union, intersection, and override. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads. The code appears to be straightforward utility functions intended for merging sets.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as utility functions for set merging strategies without any malicious intent or security risks.",
