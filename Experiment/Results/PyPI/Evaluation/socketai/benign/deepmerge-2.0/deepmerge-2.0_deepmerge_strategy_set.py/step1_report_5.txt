{
  "purpose": "Defines a class for set merging strategies used in deepmerge library, providing union, intersection, and override operations.",
  "sources": "Import statements for deepmerge.merger and local core module, class and method definitions, no external input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code performs set operations and imports only, with no data output or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; methods perform local set operations without input/output side effects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors observed. No obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from StrategyList, with static methods implementing set operations: union, intersection, and override. The methods use standard Python set operators, with no external inputs or outputs beyond function parameters. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of set merging strategies for a configuration system, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
