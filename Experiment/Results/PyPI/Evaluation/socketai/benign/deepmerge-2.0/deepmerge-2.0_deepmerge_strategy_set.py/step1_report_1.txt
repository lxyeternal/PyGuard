  "purpose": "Defines a class SetStrategies for merging set data structures using different strategies (union, intersection, override).",
  "sources": "import statements, class and method definitions, method parameters (config, path, base, nxt).",
  "sinks": "None identified; no direct data leaks, network operations, or sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (config, path, base, nxt) flow through static methods that perform set operations and return results.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns. The code performs straightforward set operations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a merging library and defines a class with static methods for set merge strategies. Methods perform standard set operations (union, intersection, override) without side effects or external interactions. No untrusted data flows into unsafe sinks. The code appears to be a standard implementation for merging strategies with no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical set merging utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely performs set operations without external data leaks or suspicious activities.",
