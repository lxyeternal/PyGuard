{
  "purpose": "This code defines a class for handling set merging strategies in a deep merge library.",
  "sources": "Import statements for deepmerge.merger and local core module; static method parameters (config, path, base, nxt) which are used as inputs.",
  "sinks": "The static methods perform set operations (union, intersection, override) on the provided 'base' and 'nxt' sets; no external sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'base' and 'nxt' flow into set operations, returning new sets; no external data flow or untrusted data processing beyond the input parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code simply defines a class with static methods for merging sets using standard Python set operations. It does not perform any I/O, network activity, or data leaks. The import statements are standard; no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. The class and methods are straightforward, with clear purposes and no suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of set merging strategies for a deep merge library. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected. It appears to be a standard, safe utility class.",
