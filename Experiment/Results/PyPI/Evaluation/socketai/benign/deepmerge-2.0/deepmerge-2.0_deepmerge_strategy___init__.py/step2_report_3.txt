  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Presence of Issues:**\n   - All reports describe the code as simple import statements from local modules within a package.\n   - There is no evidence of dynamic code execution, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads.\n   - The code appears to be a standard module setup or __init__.py file, establishing dependencies for a larger system.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no suspicious patterns or security risks.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident. The conclusions are justified based on the provided code snippet.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n   - Security risk scores are also 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Confidence levels are high (mostly 1.0 or 0.9), reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores are reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign risk scores above 0.5, which is correct given the code's benign nature.\n   - If any were to assign higher scores, that would be unjustified without evidence of malicious intent.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, consistent with the code's benign import statements.\n   - No malicious activity is suggested or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they only analyze the code snippet provided.\n   - They correctly identify that, based on this snippet alone, there is no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores across reports are consistent with the code content and analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct, no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct, code is straightforward)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (appropriate, no security risk identified)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of the import statements, there is no indication of supply chain compromise or malicious intent. The code is standard, well-structured, and free of suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, with no security concerns. No adjustments to scores are necessary.",
