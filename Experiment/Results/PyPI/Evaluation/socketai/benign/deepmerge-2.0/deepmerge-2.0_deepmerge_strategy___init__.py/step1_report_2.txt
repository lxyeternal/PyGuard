  "purpose": "The code imports various strategy classes and modules, likely for configuring or managing different strategies within a larger application.",
  "sources": "The imports from relative modules: .core, .dict, .fallback, .list, .set, .type_conflict",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling points are present in this snippet",
  "flows": "The code imports classes/modules but does not process data or execute functions; no data flow from source to sink observed",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs; the code is straightforward import statements",
  "analysis": "This snippet consists solely of import statements from relative modules, indicating modular design. There are no functions, data processing, or system interactions. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious payloads are present. The code appears to be standard module imports typical in Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of import statements establishing dependencies within a package. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security issues, or anomalies. Overall, it appears benign.",
