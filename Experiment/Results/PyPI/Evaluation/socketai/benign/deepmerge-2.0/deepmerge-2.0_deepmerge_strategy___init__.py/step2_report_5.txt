  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements from local modules.\n- No dynamic code execution, data processing, or untrusted data handling is observed.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1.0 or 0.9), which is appropriate given the straightforward code.\n\n---\n\n### Specific review of each report:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** All correctly identify that the code is just importing modules/classes, likely for organizing a larger application.\n- **Sources & sinks:** No data flows or untrusted data points.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected; code is standard and straightforward.\n- **Conclusion & scores:** All conclude benign, with malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores at 0, which is consistent.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n- The reports are very similar and uniformly conclude no security risk, which seems accurate given the code snippet.\n- The confidence levels are high, which is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- **Scores:** The scores assigned seem appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n- **Higher risk scores?** No, there's no evidence to justify higher risk or malware scores.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly set to 0; no obfuscation is evident.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0; no malicious activity is present.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the provided code snippet and reports:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (benign)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- If the imported modules contain malicious code, it cannot be determined from this snippet alone. However, based solely on these import statements, there is no indication of malicious activity.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Estimated Score | Justification                                              |\n|------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                       | No malicious activity detected in import statements.        |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                       | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation observed.          |\n| Security Risk    | 0                       | No vulnerabilities or suspicious patterns identified.     |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, with no security concerns based on this snippet.",
