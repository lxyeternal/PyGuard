{
  "purpose": "This code imports various strategy classes/modules from local relative paths, likely for modular design within a larger system.",
  "sources": "Import statements sourcing classes and modules from local package submodules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code only performs static imports.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or untrusted data passing through; the code is purely import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from relative modules, indicating a modular setup. No dynamic execution, data processing, or untrusted input handling is evident. The code is standard for Python package initialization or module setup. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores as zero. The confidence levels are high, reflecting certainty in the benign assessment. No logical flaws or security concerns are detected based on this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of import statements with no malicious or obfuscated content. The security risk is negligible, and the scores are consistent with the code's simplicity. The overall assessment confirms no security issues are present in this snippet.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
