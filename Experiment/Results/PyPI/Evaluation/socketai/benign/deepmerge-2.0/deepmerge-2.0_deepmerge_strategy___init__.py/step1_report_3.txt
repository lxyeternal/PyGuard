  "purpose": "Import statements for various strategy modules and classes within a package, likely for organizing different strategy implementations.",
  "sources": "Module imports from the current package (relative imports).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or user input handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis needed as this is only import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code solely contains import statements for modules and classes from the same package, using relative imports. There is no execution logic, no data handling, and no signs of malicious activity. The imports suggest modular design for strategy patterns, with no suspicious or potentially malicious patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import statement block, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger, well-structured project. No security issues or malware are detected based on this snippet.",
