{
  "purpose": "Importing various strategy classes and modules, likely to be used in a larger system for managing different strategies.",
  "sources": "Import statements from relative modules within the package",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data flows involving untrusted input; import statements themselves are benign",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as this code only performs imports without data processing or untrusted data flows",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and typical for Python package modules",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules. It appears to set up strategy-related classes and modules for use elsewhere. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs. The structure is standard for a package's init or module file, importing classes and modules to expose their functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign import statement block with no malicious behavior or security concerns. It does not process untrusted data nor contains suspicious code segments.",
