  "purpose": "Define and initialize different Merger strategies for data structure merging.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, relative imports from .merger and .strategy.core, and the module's own constant definitions.",
  "sinks": "Instantiation of Merger objects which may internally process data, but no explicit untrusted data sources or sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Imports → Merger class instantiation with strategy lists and configurations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward and primarily declares configurations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a list of default strategies, and initializes three Merger objects with specific configurations. There are no input/output operations, external data reads, or potentially malicious code segments. The Merger objects are configured with standard data structure strategies, and no hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a configuration setup for data merging strategies using the Merger class. It contains no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior. It appears safe and benign.",
