{
  "purpose": "Defines and initializes different Merger strategies for data structure merging operations, including default, always overwrite, and conservative merging.",
  "sources": "Import statements from __future__, local modules (.merger, .strategy.core), and module-level variable assignments.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no external data input, network communication, or sensitive data handling present.",
  "flows": "Initialization of Merger objects with specific strategies and configurations; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated logic detected. Use of 'from __future__' is standard for compatibility, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules and defines three Merger instances with different strategies for data merging operations. The code appears to be part of a larger package for data manipulation. No external data input, network communication, or system commands are present. The logic is straightforward, focusing on data structure handling, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a configuration/setup module for data merging strategies and shows no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears benign and intended for use within a larger, controlled project.",
