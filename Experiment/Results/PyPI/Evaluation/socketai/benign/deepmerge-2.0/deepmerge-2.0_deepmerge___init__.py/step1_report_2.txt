  "purpose": "Define various Merger strategies for combining data structures such as lists, dictionaries, and sets.",
  "sources": "Import statements from __future__, relative imports from .merger and .strategy.core modules.",
  "sinks": "Instantiation of Merger objects with configuration strategies.",
  "flows": "Code initializes Merger objects with predefined strategies, potentially affecting how data is merged.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated elements. Use of relative imports is typical for packages, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features and other modules, then defines a list of type-specific merge strategies. It creates three Merger instances: 'always_merger', 'merge_or_raise', and 'conservative_merger', each configured with different strategies for handling data merging conflicts. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or suspicious data handling. The code appears to be standard configuration for a data merging utility within a package.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements configuration objects for data merging strategies with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger, benign library managing data structures.",
