{
  "purpose": "This code defines different Merger objects with specific merging strategies for data structures like list, dict, and set.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules and classes, and defines constants and variables for Merger instances.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no input/output operations or network interactions.",
  "flows": "The Merger objects are initialized with predefined strategies; no data flows from external sources in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining Merger instances with specific strategies for merging data structures. It imports modules, sets constants, and initializes Merger objects with clear, safe parameters. There are no dynamic inputs, no network or file operations, and no suspicious logic or code obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign implementation of merging strategies with no malicious intent or security risks. It is likely part of a larger, safe project and does not contain malware or security vulnerabilities.",
