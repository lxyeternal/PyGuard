  "purpose": "Define and instantiate different Merger strategies for handling data structure merging.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading observed in the code.",
  "sinks": "No potential sinks or untrusted data flows identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only initializes objects and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. The code appears to be standard class instantiations and constant definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules and defines three Merger objects with specific strategies. It appears to set up configuration for merging data structures (list, dict, set) with different behaviors. There are no inputs, no data processing, no network or filesystem operations, and no obfuscated or suspicious code. The code strictly involves configuration and object instantiation related to merging strategies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration for data merging strategies with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be legitimate setup code for a larger library or application, with no indications of malicious intent or security concerns.",
