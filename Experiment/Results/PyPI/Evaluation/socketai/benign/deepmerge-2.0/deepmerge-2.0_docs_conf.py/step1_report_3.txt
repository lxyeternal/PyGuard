  "purpose": "Configuration script for Sphinx documentation build process, setting up environment, themes, and output options.",
  "sources": "Imports os module, environment variables, and static paths; no external input sources are read.",
  "sinks": "No sink points that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; configuration values are static or environment-dependent.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution observed. The code is standard Sphinx configuration with commented sections.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily imports os, sets configuration parameters for Sphinx, and dynamically determines theme based on environment variables. All code is static configuration data with no input validation, user input handling, or code execution. No network, file system, or environment manipulation beyond configuration. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or backdoors are present. The use of environment variable to detect 'READTHEDOCS' is standard for conditional theming and does not indicate malicious intent. No embedded or hidden code is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Sphinx configuration file with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It sets up documentation build parameters and dynamically adjusts themes based on environment, which is typical and safe.",
