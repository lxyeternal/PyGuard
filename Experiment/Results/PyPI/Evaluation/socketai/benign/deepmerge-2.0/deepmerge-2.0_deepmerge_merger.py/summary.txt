  "conclusion": "The core code is safe and does not contain malware or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the external strategies, which could be malicious if sourced from untrusted entities. The assigned scores in the reports are appropriate, with malware at 0, obfuscated at 0, and a low risk score (~0.2). Ensuring strategies are from trusted sources mitigates the main security risk."
