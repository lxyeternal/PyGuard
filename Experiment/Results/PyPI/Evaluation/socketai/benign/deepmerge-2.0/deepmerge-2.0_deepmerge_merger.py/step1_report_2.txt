{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Merger class for combining objects based on configurable strategies, intended for use in data merging operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads class and method definitions, imports modules and types, and processes input parameters for strategies.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks that handle untrusted data or perform insecure operations; no network, file, or sensitive data access occurs.",
  "flows": "The main flow involves initializing strategies based on input parameters, then applying these strategies during the merge process. Strategy functions are invoked during merge and conflict resolution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. The code uses dynamic class and function handling appropriately, with no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and a local 'strategy' module, defines a class with clearly structured methods, and processes input parameters to assign strategies for merging data types. Strategy invocation occurs during merging, with logical flow and type handling. No data leakage, malicious data manipulation, or hidden backdoors are apparent. The code's logic appears standard for configurable merging operations, with proper use of typing and error handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a configurable object merging utility. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. It does not handle or transmit untrusted data beyond its internal logic. Overall, it is a safe, standard implementation with low security concern.",
