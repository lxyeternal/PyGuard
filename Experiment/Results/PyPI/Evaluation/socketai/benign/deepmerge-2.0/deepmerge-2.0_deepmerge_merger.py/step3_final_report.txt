{
  "purpose": "The code implements a Merger class that merges objects based on configurable strategies, supporting type-specific strategies, fallbacks, and conflict resolution.",
  "sources": "External strategy functions provided during initialization, invoked within value_strategy and type_conflict_strategy methods.",
  "sinks": "Invocation of external strategy callables, which could execute malicious code if strategies are untrusted.",
  "flows": "External strategies are called during merge operations, passing the Merger instance, path, base, and next objects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and does not contain obfuscation or embedded malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of a strategy-based object merger. It relies on external callables for strategies, which introduces a potential security risk if those callables are malicious. No obfuscation or malicious code is present within the core implementation. The main security concern is the trustworthiness of external strategies. The malware score should be 0, as there is no embedded malicious code. The obfuscated score is 0, given the clarity of the code. The security risk score can be around 0.2, reflecting the potential risk if strategies are malicious but not inherently within the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The core code is safe and does not contain malware or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the external strategies, which could be malicious if sourced from untrusted entities. The assigned scores in the reports are appropriate, with malware at 0, obfuscated at 0, and a low risk score (~0.2). Ensuring strategies are from trusted sources mitigates the main security risk.",
