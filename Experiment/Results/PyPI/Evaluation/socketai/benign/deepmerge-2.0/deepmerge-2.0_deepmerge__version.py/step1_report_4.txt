{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, primarily for version tracking and type checking purposes.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string and tuple variables, and import statements under TYPE_CHECKING.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or outputs; no sinks that lead to data leaks or execution vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Version string and tuple are set directly from hardcoded values; no flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code's primary function is to declare version information variables for the package. It includes a conditional import based on TYPE_CHECKING, which is standard for type hinting. The version data is hardcoded, which is typical and expected in such context. No dynamic code execution, external data reading, or sensitive data handling occurs. No indicators of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version declaration snippet generated by setuptools_scm, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves a simple, legitimate purpose in version management.",
