  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, including version string and tuple, based on whether type checking is enabled.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version and version tuple variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data is processed or output that could lead to leaks or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Variables are assigned constant values; no data flow from external sources or untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated logic present. The code is straightforward version info assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports typing modules when type checking is enabled, then defines version variables with hardcoded version data. The logic is simple, standard, and lacks external data sources or sinks. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard version information snippet generated by setuptools_scm. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious logic, and no security risks.",
