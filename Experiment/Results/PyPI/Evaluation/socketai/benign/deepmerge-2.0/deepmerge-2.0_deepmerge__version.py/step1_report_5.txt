  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, and sets version variables.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements for version strings and tuples.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no data leakage or external effects observed.",
  "flows": "N/A – straightforward variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, generated, and contains no suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code uses a standard pattern for managing version info with conditional typing imports. It assigns version strings and tuples explicitly, with no dynamic code execution or external data handling. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The structure is typical for versioning modules, with no anomalies or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version information setup with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
