  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, and sets version variables accordingly.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version strings and tuples, no input or data reading involved.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only assigns static version information.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and auto-generated for versioning.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports type hints, then assigns version information statically. It does not execute any external data, perform I/O, or contain suspicious code. There are no hidden or malicious behaviors; it is a standard auto-generated version file. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, auto-generated version definition script with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves to define version metadata for a package.",
