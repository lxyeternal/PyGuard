  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall Code Review:**\n\nThe provided code is a standard, auto-generated version file created by setuptools_scm. It defines version variables with hardcoded values, includes a conditional import for type hints, and contains no external data handling, I/O, or dynamic behavior. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1:\n- **Summary:** Correctly states that the code is straightforward, auto-generated, and contains no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues here.\n\n### Report 2:\n- **Summary:** Also correctly identifies the code as benign, standard, and free of suspicious logic.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n### Report 3:\n- **Summary:** Same as above; straightforward, standard version info assignment.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n### Report 4:\n- **Summary:** Again, correctly describes the code as a simple, generated version declaration.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n### Report 5:\n- **Summary:** Consistent with previous assessments; no malicious or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence:** The code matches the description in all reports; it's a standard version file with no suspicious or malicious content.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, auto-generated code.\n- **Security risk:** Zero, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n- **Confidence:** All reports are confident (1), which is justified.\n\n### **My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks involved.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No changes needed. The code is a typical, auto-generated versioning script with no security concerns.",
