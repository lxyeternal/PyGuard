  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, auto-generated by setuptools_scm, and contains only static version information.\n- No external data sources, user input, or dynamic code execution are involved.\n- The code uses standard patterns for type checking with `TYPE_CHECKING`.\n- There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Specific points per report:**\n- **Report 1-5:** All conclude that the code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The confidence level is 1 across all reports, indicating high certainty.\n- Malware scores are 0 in all reports, aligning with the analysis that no malicious activity is present.\n- The purpose, sources, sinks, and flow analyses are consistent and accurate.\n\n**Assessment of scores:**\n- The **malware score** of 0 is justified; no malicious behavior is evident.\n- The **obfuscated score** of 0 is justified; the code is clear and auto-generated.\n- The **security risk** score of 0 is justified; no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are present.\n- The **risk score** is also 0, which is appropriate given the above.\n\n**Potential issues or assumptions:**\n- The reports assume the code is auto-generated and standard, which appears correct.\n- No hidden malicious behavior or backdoors are suggested or evident.\n- The code does not contain any suspicious patterns or behaviors.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Based on the detailed analysis, I agree with the reports' assessments.\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is a benign, auto-generated version information module with no security concerns.",
