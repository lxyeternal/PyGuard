  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is auto-generated, straightforward, and serves to define version information.\n- No external data, input, or dynamic behavior is involved.\n- No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious patterns are identified.\n- The code is standard for package versioning, with conditional type hint imports, static version strings, and tuples.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code is static, with hardcoded version info.\n- No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.\n- No anomalies or suspicious constructs are present.\n- The reports consistently assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The security risk score is 0 across all reports, which is reasonable given the nature of the code.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- Since the code is auto-generated and static, there is little room for malicious behavior.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code does not perform any operations that could be exploited or contain vulnerabilities.\n\n**Score justification:**\n- **Malware score (0):** Correct, no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score (0):** Correct, code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score (0):** Appropriate, no security risk identified.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is benign, standard, and safe.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No modifications to the scores are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\nAll evidence points to this being a typical, auto-generated version info file with no security concerns. The detailed analysis supports maintaining the current scores.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is safe, and the reports' assessments are accurate.
