  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code verification**:  \n   The code is straightforward, auto-generated by setuptools_scm, assigning static version strings and tuples. There are no external data reads, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns. The use of `TYPE_CHECKING` for type hints is standard practice.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes**:  \n   The reports correctly identify that the code is simple, static, and standard for versioning purposes. No errors or mistakes are evident in the analysis.\n\n3. **Score evaluations**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - malware: 0  \n   - securityRisk: 0  \n   - obfuscated: 0  \n   - confidence: 1\n\n   These seem appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n4. **Risk scores justification**:  \n   Since the code is purely static, auto-generated, and contains no malicious or suspicious logic, the assigned scores are reasonable. No need to adjust unless new information arises.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations**:  \n   The code does not perform any malicious actions—no code injection, no obfuscated logic, no external data handling. The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Challenging assumptions**:  \n   All reports correctly dismiss any security concerns based on the code's simplicity and purpose. No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is appropriate.\n\n7. **Score consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's behavior. The confidence level of 1 aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score**: **0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score**: **0** — code is clear, straightforward, auto-generated.\n- **Risk score**: **0** — no security risks identified.\n\n### Overall recommendation:\n\nThe code is benign, standard, and safe. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated score**: 0  \n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is a simple, auto-generated versioning snippet with no security concerns.",
