  "purpose": "Defines static version information for the package, auto-generated by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version string and tuple assignments; conditional import for type hints.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow from untrusted sources or external inputs.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignments without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, auto-generated, with no suspicious patterns or behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static version info module with no external data handling, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. It uses standard practices for type hinting and version assignment. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the code's nature and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and safe. The reports correctly identify it as such, and the scoring accurately reflects the absence of malicious or suspicious elements. No modifications are necessary.",
