  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, and is used for package versioning and type checking.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version string assignment and type checking conditional import.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or potential data leak points identified.",
  "flows": "N/A - No data flow from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code; the code uses standard patterns for versioning and type hints. No hardcoded credentials or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code sets version information variables for a Python package, using a conditional import based on TYPE_CHECKING for type hints. It assigns a static version string and tuple, which are typical in package metadata files. No external input, data leakage, or suspicious behavior observed. The structure is straightforward and aligns with standard practices. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard package versioning snippet with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
