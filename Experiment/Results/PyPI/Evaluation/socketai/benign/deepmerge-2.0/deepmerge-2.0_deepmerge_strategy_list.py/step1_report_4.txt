  "purpose": "Define list merging strategies for the deepmerge library, enabling customizable list operations during data merging.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing deepmerge.merger, core.StrategyList, and extended_set. No external input reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted input; the code performs internal list operations without external data output or network communication.",
  "flows": "N/A – the functions perform in-memory list manipulations without external data flow or untrusted data sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The use of ExtendedSet appears to be a normal utility class for set operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class ListStrategies with static methods implementing various list merge strategies: override, prepend, append, and append unique. Each method simply manipulates input lists and returns the result without side effects or external data interactions. No use of dynamic code execution, network calls, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code appears to be straightforward utility code for list merging logic within a larger library.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard list operations to support merging strategies and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. No anomalies or indicators of malicious intent are identified.",
