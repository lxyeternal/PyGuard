{
  "purpose": "Define strategies for merging lists in a deep merge operation, including override, prepend, append, and append without duplicates.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write to files, send data over networks, or handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; all operations are internal list manipulations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns observed; standard list operations and class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a class with static methods for list merging strategies, relying on standard Python list operations and a custom ExtendedSet class. There are no input/output operations, no network access, or handling of external data. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are present. The structure and content are typical for a utility module meant for list merging strategies in a larger library.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of list merging strategies without any malicious intent or security risks. It functions as part of a larger merging framework and does not include any suspicious behavior.",
