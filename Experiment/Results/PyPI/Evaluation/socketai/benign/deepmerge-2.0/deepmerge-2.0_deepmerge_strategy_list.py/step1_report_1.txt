{
  "purpose": "Defines list merging strategies for a configuration management system, including override, prepend, append, and append without duplicates.",
  "sources": "Imports from deepmerge.merger, core, and extended_set modules; no direct user input or external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data influences critical operations are present.",
  "flows": "The functions process list data passed as parameters; no external or untrusted data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward, implementing simple list operations without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines static methods for list operations such as override, prepend, append, and append unique. All functions manipulate lists directly and safely. No input handling from external sources, no data leakage, or malicious code execution patterns. The code relies on the ExtendedSet class for duplicate filtering, which seems standard. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The structure and logic are typical for a configuration merging utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of list merging strategies with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs predictable, safe list operations, suitable for configuration management. No malicious behavior or sabotage detected.",
