  "purpose": "Defines a class ListStrategies that provides various list merging strategies for use with deepmerge library.",
  "sources": "Imports deepmerge.merger, local modules .core and ..extended_set",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external outputs are present",
  "flows": "None identified; functions operate on provided parameters and return manipulated lists",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors; straightforward list manipulations",
  "analysis": "The code provides static methods to merge lists with different strategies: override, prepend, append, and append unique. It uses a custom ExtendedSet class for deduplication in append_unique. No external data input, network activity, or environment variable usage detected. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns observed. The code appears to be part of a configuration or utility module for list merging strategies, with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, focused on list merging strategies without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
