{
  "purpose": "Provides list merging strategies for configuration management, including override, prepend, append, and append unique.",
  "sources": "The functions read input lists 'base' and 'nxt' as parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external outputs; data flows are internal list operations.",
  "flows": "Input lists 'base' and 'nxt' flow into functions which perform list concatenation or filtering, returning new lists.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward list operations, reliance on ExtendedSet for deduplication.",
  "analysis": "The code defines static methods for list merging strategies, performing simple list concatenations and deduplication using ExtendedSet. No external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The logic is clear, predictable, and safe. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data leakage are evident. The code relies on standard list operations and a utility class, with no suspicious patterns or external dependencies that could pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for list merging with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The assessments and scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are accurate and justified.",
