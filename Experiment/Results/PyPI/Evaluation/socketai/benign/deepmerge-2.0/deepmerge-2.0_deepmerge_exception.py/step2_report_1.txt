  "review": "Let's proceed step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The provided code appears to be a set of custom exception classes related to the `deepmerge` library.\n   - There are no apparent vulnerabilities, malicious code, or suspicious behavior within this code snippet.\n   - The code is straightforward, defining exception classes with no external dependencies beyond `deepmerge.merger`.\n   - No malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent is evident.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Summary:**\n   - The reports contain only \"Empty response\" messages with no details.\n   - Since no actual report content is provided, I cannot evaluate the correctness or implications of any claims.\n   - The absence of detailed reports makes it impossible to identify or confirm any security issues or vulnerabilities.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - Without specific report details, I cannot assess the malware, obfuscated, or risk scores accurately.\n   - Given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious activity, the malware score should be very low or zero.\n   - The obfuscated score should also be zero, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - The overall risk score should be minimal unless the reports suggest otherwise, which they do not.\n\n4. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - Since no actual report content is provided, any assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious behavior would be unfounded.\n   - The code does not exhibit any signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores with the Report:**\n   - No scores are provided, but based on the available information, they should reflect minimal risk.\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**\n- The code itself is benign and does not contain malware or obfuscation.\n- The reports lack details; therefore, I cannot identify any issues or justify higher risk scores.\n- The scores should be very low across malware, obfuscated, and risk categories.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Given the current data, I would assign:\n  - Malware score: 0\n  - Obfuscated score: 0\n  - Risk score: 0.1 (to account for the potential of unknown issues, but very low)\n\n**Note:** If future reports provide more details, I will reassess accordingly.",
