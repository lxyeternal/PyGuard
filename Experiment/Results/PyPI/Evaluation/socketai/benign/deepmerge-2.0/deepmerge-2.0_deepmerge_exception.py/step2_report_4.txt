  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports systematically.\n\n1. **Code Analysis:**\n   - The code is a set of custom exception classes for a module called `deepmerge`. \n   - The main class of interest is `InvalidMerge`, which captures detailed context when a merge operation fails.\n   - The code appears straightforward, with no evident malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n   - The `deepmerge` dependency is used, but its implementation isn't provided here. The code assumes `deepmerge.merger.Merger` exists.\n\n2. **Reports Overview:**\n   - All reports are empty responses with no details provided.\n   - No specific issues, errors, or vulnerabilities are described in these reports.\n\n3. **Assessment of Report Content:**\n   - Since the reports contain no information, there's no evidence of malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or code flaws based on the report data.\n   - The lack of details makes it impossible to identify logical errors or malicious intent.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0.0 — No evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 — The code is clear and straightforward; no obfuscation detected.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0.0 — Without any report details, there's no indication of a security risk.\n\n5. **Critical Considerations:**\n   - The code itself doesn't seem to contain vulnerabilities or malicious elements.\n   - The reports are empty; thus, there's no basis for raising concern.\n   - If the reports were to include details about how the code is used or potential issues, a re-evaluation would be necessary.\n\n**Final Evaluation:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0\n\n**Summary:**\nBased on the provided code and the empty reports, there is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk. The reports lack detail, so no further analysis can be performed. The current scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
