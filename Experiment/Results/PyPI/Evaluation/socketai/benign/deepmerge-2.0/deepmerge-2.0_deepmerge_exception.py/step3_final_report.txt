  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to deepmerge operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the 'deepmerge.merger' module during class initialization.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data flows; the code only raises exceptions with internal data.",
  "flows": "No external data flows or untrusted data processing are present; the code only constructs exception messages.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, defining exception classes with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of exception class definitions for deepmerge errors, with no external data processing, network activity, or obfuscation. The code is simple, clear, and does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior. The reports provided are empty, offering no details about vulnerabilities or malicious activity. Given the absence of any indicators of malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation, the code is benign. The lack of report content prevents any reassessment of risk, malware, or obfuscation scores. Overall, the code is safe, and the security risk is minimal.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The reports are empty, so no issues are identified. The scores should be set to zero for malware and obfuscation, and the overall security risk is negligible.",
