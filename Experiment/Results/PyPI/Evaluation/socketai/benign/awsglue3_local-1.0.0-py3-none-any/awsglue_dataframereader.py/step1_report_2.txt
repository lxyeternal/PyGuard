  "purpose": "Provides methods to create data frames from a catalog or options in a Glue context, likely for data processing.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in methods 'from_catalog' and 'from_options', especially 'kwargs', 'database', 'table_name', 'connection_type', 'connection_options'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the methods 'create_data_frame_from_catalog' and 'create_data_frame_from_options' called on 'self._glue_context', which may process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> Validation and conditional logic -> Calls to 'self._glue_context' methods with input data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code structures. The code performs parameter validation and delegates to external methods.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with methods that validate input parameters and delegate data frame creation to a Glue context object. The 'from_catalog' method checks for mutually exclusive parameters and ensures required parameters are present. The 'from_options' method straightforwardly passes parameters to the context's method. No data is processed or transmitted within this code; all data handling occurs in delegated methods. The code does not contain any hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic. It appears to be standard glue data source handling code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard data access wrapper functions with proper validation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The use of external methods on 'self._glue_context' could potentially process untrusted data, but this is expected for such functionality and is not malicious in itself.",
