{
  "purpose": "Defines a DataFrameReader class for creating data frames from catalog sources or options within AWS Glue context.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in from_catalog() and from_options() methods, including kwargs, database, table_name, connection_type, connection_options, format, and format_options.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly visible in the code; no data is written or sent to external sources or network destinations.",
  "flows": "User calls from_catalog() or from_options() with parameters → methods process inputs and invoke corresponding _glue_context methods with filtered/validated parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code performs parameter validation and delegates to external context methods. No obfuscation or unusual constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs parameter validation for required arguments and potential conflicts, such as ensuring only one of 'name_space' or 'database' is specified. It safely delegates data frame creation to the provided _glue_context methods. The logic appears straightforward, with no evidence of malicious activity. No input/output streams, network operations, or secret handling are present. The code maintains standard practices for data processing setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard data reading utility class for AWS Glue, with proper validation and delegation. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
