  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard AWS Glue data source wrapper with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), consistent with the analysis. The confidence level is high, given the straightforward nature of the code."
