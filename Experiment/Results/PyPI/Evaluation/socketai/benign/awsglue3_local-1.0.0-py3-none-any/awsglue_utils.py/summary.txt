  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate utility module for AWS Glue argument parsing and JVM data conversion. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The low security risk score (around 0.1) is justified by the minimal potential for input exploitation, but no active threats are present."
