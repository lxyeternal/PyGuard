  "purpose": "Utility functions for argument handling, JVM data conversion, and argument validation in AWS Glue jobs.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments, internal configuration parameters, JVM method calls",
  "sinks": "JVM method invocations, data serialization functions",
  "flows": "Input arguments are parsed and validated, then converted into JVM objects or used in JVM method calls",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard argument parsing, validation against reserved options, and JVM data conversions using safe, well-understood methods. No network activity, code injection, or backdoors are present. The functions serve legitimate purposes in AWS Glue job configuration. The validation routines prevent misuse of reserved arguments. The JVM conversion functions handle user inputs securely. Overall, the code is straightforward, well-structured, and aligns with typical AWS Glue utility modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate utility module for AWS Glue argument parsing and JVM data conversion. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The low security risk score (around 0.1) is justified by the minimal potential for input exploitation, but no active threats are present.",
