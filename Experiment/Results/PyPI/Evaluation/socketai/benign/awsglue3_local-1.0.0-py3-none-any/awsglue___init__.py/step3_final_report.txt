{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module that imports the 'DynamicFrame' class from a local module and exposes it for external use via the __all__ list.",
  "sources": "The code reads licensing comments and imports 'DynamicFrame' from a relative module.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data inputs, outputs, or external communication points in this code.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'DynamicFrame' and exposes it; no data flows or untrusted data handling are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Python module with licensing comments, a straightforward import statement, and an __all__ declaration. It contains no dynamic behavior, data processing, or external interactions. The code is typical for a package interface, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security flaws. The license comments are standard legal boilerplate. The import source is a relative module, which is common in package code. The reports correctly identify the code as benign, with scores of malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, and very low security risk scores, consistent with the code's simplicity. No changes are necessary, as the code is a standard, safe module export.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward module that exposes a class from a local package component. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
