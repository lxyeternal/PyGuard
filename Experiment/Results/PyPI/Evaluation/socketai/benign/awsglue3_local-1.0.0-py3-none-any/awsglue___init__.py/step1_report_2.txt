  "purpose": "Define a module that exports the DynamicFrame class from the dynamicframe package.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing DynamicFrame from a relative module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or user input sources present.",
  "flows": "N/A - No data flow or untrusted data propagation detected.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The code appears to be a simple module export.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module definition with licensing comments, an import statement, and an __all__ declaration. No input sources, sinks, or suspicious behavior are evident. The license comments indicate the code is licensed under an Amazon license but do not influence security analysis. No dynamic code execution, data handling, or network activity observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module definition with no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security concerns. It merely exports a class from another module.",
