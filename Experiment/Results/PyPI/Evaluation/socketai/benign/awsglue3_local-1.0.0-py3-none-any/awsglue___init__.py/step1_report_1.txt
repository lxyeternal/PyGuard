  "sinks": "There are no sinks or places where untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data paths are present in this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and contains no unusual or suspicious patterns. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports 'DynamicFrame' from a relative module and exposes it via __all__. It is likely part of a larger package, acting as an interface or convenience layer. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or malicious data handling. The license comments indicate legal information but do not influence security. Overall, the code is benign and standard for package modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module definition with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply exposes a class for external use without any suspicious elements.",
