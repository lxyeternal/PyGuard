  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code presence and functionality:**  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is a minimal module that imports 'DynamicFrame' from a relative module and exposes it via `__all__`. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, data processing, or external communication. The code is straightforward and appears to serve as an interface or convenience layer.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**  \n   None of the reports point out any errors or flaws. The code is syntactically correct and logically simple. It is consistent with standard Python module practices.\n\n3. **Scores assessment:**  \n   - **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's clarity.  \n   - **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.  \n   - **Security risk:** All reports assign very low scores (mostly 0 or 0.1), which is reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**  \n   Since all reports assign scores well below 0.5 for malware and security risk, and the code is simple, there's no justification for higher scores.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The code does not perform any suspicious operations, nor does it include obfuscated or malicious patterns. The malware score of 0 across all reports is justified.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports correctly interpret the code as benign, with no assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis. The minimal, straightforward nature of the code warrants low scores across all categories.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risks identified)\n\nThis code appears to be a standard, benign module used for exposing a class in a package, with no security concerns.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, straightforward, and typical of package interface modules. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. No changes are necessary.",
