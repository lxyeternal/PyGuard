{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define an import and export interface for the DynamicFrame class, likely as part of a larger library or package.",
  "sources": "The code does not read any input or data; it only imports a class from a relative module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data output points; the code does not process or send data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is present; the code merely re-exports a class.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no unusual language features or obfuscated logic. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard module file, importing 'DynamicFrame' from a relative module and exporting it via __all__. It contains no logic, data handling, or external interactions. The licensing comments are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. Overall, it looks like boilerplate code typical in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this code snippet. It is a simple module export file with no apparent security concerns.",
