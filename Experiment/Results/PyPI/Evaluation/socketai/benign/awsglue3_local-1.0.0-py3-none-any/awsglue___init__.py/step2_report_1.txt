  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the security implications.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is minimal, consisting solely of an import statement and an `__all__` declaration.\n- No data input/output, network activity, or external interactions are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are detected.\n- The license comments are standard and do not influence security.\n- The import source is a relative module, which is typical in package code.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and serves as a module export.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across reports, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n- The security risk scores are very low or zero, consistent with the absence of any suspicious behavior.\n- The confidence levels are high (1), indicating the reviewers are certain about their assessments.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n\n- There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious logic.\n- The only slight concern could be the `securityRisk` score of 0.1 in report 4, but given the code's nature, this is likely an overestimation or a default conservative score.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The code appears to be a standard module file that exposes a class for external use.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\nThis code snippet is a typical, benign part of a package, with no security concerns.\n\n**Final note:** The reports are thorough and accurate. No changes to the scores or conclusions are necessary.",
