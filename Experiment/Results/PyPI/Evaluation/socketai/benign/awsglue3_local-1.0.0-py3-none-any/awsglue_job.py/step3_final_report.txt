  "purpose": "A utility class for managing AWS Glue jobs, providing static configuration options and delegating job control methods to JVM objects.",
  "sources": "Static methods returning predefined option lists; JVM method calls via 'self._job' and 'glue_context' parameters.",
  "sinks": "Delegated JVM method calls; no direct handling of untrusted input or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Method calls passing parameters to JVM objects; static options used as configuration parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API wrapper for AWS Glue job management, with static configuration options and delegation to JVM methods. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data leaks are evident. The static options are harmless, and the JVM interactions are standard for AWS Glue scripts. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns justify a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1). The reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, with scores aligned to its functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility class for AWS Glue job management with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The current scores are appropriate; malware and obfuscation scores should remain at 0, and the security risk score can be set at 0.1 to reflect minimal risk.",
