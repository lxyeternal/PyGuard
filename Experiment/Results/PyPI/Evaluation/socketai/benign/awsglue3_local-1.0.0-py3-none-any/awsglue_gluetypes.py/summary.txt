  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign schema management library with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It processes JSON data safely within its scope, and the external dependency is typical for AWS Glue environments. The low security risk score is justified, and the malware score should remain at 0."
