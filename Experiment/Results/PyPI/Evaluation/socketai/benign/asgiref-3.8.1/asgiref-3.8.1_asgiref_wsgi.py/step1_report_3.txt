{
  "purpose": "This code provides a wrapper to convert a WSGI application into an ASGI application, facilitating asynchronous server handling of WSGI-based web apps.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the 'receive' function (HTTP request body), and headers and scope information from the 'scope' parameter.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'send' function to send HTTP response start and body messages, and 'start_response' method to initiate response headers.",
  "flows": "Input data from 'receive' -> body stream in 'run_wsgi_app' -> WSGI application processing -> response headers and body sent via 'send' functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity observed. The code is a standard WSGI to ASGI wrapper. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of adapting WSGI apps to run under ASGI servers. It manages request input, builds WSGI environ, and correctly handles response initiation and streaming. There are no signs of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The use of standard libraries and typical patterns suggests a focus on compatibility and functionality. The absence of external network calls or untrusted data manipulation beyond standard web server procedures indicates low likelihood of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, legitimate implementation for WSGI to ASGI adaptation with no evident malicious intent or security risks. It functions as expected for web application interoperability without introducing security threats.",
