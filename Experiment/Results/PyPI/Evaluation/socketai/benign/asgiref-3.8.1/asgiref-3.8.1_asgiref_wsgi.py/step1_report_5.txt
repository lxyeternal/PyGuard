{
  "purpose": "The code provides a wrapper to convert a WSGI application into an ASGI application, enabling compatibility between different server interfaces.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the 'receive' callable, primarily from 'http.request' messages, and request headers from 'scope['headers']'.",
  "sinks": "The code calls the WSGI application with a constructed environment, and sends responses via the 'send' callable, particularly using 'http.response.start' and 'http.response.body'.",
  "flows": "Data flows from incoming 'http.request' messages into the 'body' BytesIO object, then through 'build_environ' into the WSGI app, with response data sent via 'send' after being generated by the WSGI application.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code properly manages asynchronous/synchronous boundaries, and processes headers securely. No obfuscated code or misleading variables are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code securely wraps a WSGI app to run in an ASGI environment, properly managing the request lifecycle, headers, and response. It carefully constructs the WSGI environment, handles request bodies and headers, and sends responses, including managing response headers and content-length. No malicious or sabotage code, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system tampering, is detected. The code appears to be a standard implementation for interface compatibility, with no suspicious data flows or unsafe practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard WSGI to ASGI wrapper without any signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate component for asynchronous web server support. Overall security risks are minimal, with no malicious behaviors or vulnerabilities identified.",
