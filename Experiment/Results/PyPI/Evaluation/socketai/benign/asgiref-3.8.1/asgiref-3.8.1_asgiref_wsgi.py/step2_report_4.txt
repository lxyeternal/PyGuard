  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the details, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose & Source/Sink:** Describes standard WSGI to ASGI conversion, reading request data, headers, and sending responses.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious activity; uses common libraries and practices.  \n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.  \n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Purpose & Source/Sink:** Similar purpose; notes potential misuse of 'send' for malicious payloads.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious activity detected; standard pattern.  \n- **Conclusion:** Secure and standard implementation.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.  \n**Assessment:** Appropriate; no red flags.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Purpose & Source/Sink:** Standard WSGI to ASGI adapter, handling request/response flow.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior; uses typical libraries and patterns.  \n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, secure code.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.  \n**Assessment:** Correct and consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Purpose & Source/Sink:** Similar, with emphasis on proper request/response management.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity; standard handling.  \n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, secure implementation.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.  \n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Purpose & Source/Sink:** Same as others; emphasizes safe handling.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious indicators; standard code.  \n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, no malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.  \n**Assessment:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious behavior, consistent with the code's nature as a WSGI-ASGI adapter.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; code is clear and standard.  \n- **Risk Score:** Very low, given the code's function and the lack of suspicious activity.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (or possibly 0.0, but given the nature of web adapters, a minimal risk is acceptable)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-implemented WSGI to ASGI adapter with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and aligned with the code's purpose.\n\n**Recommendations:**  \nNo changes needed; the assessments are accurate and justified.",
