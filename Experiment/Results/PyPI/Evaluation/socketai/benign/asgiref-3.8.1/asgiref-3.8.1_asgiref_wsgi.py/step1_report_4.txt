{
  "purpose": "The code provides a wrapper to convert a WSGI application into an ASGI application, enabling asynchronous server handling for WSGI apps.",
  "sources": "Reads incoming HTTP request data via the receive() coroutine, including message['body'] and message['type']. Reads headers from scope['headers'].",
  "sinks": "Calls the WSGI application with the constructed environ, and sends responses via the send() coroutine. Uses self.sync_send to send response start and body messages.",
  "flows": "Request data from receive() is accumulated into a body stream; build_environ() creates WSGI environ; run_wsgi_app() executes the WSGI app; output is sent via self.sync_send.",
  "anomalies": "Uses SpooledTemporaryFile to store request body; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious domain connections or file modifications; no obfuscated code or dynamic execution. The code appears to be a standard adapter with proper handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward WSGI-to-ASGI adapter implementation. It securely reads request data, builds WSGI environment, and executes the WSGI application in a thread-safe manner, then forwards responses. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. The usage of SpooledTemporaryFile is standard for handling request bodies. No external network connections or data leaks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a WSGI to ASGI adapter, with no malicious or suspicious activity detected. It adheres to standard patterns for async WSGI handling and does not contain malicious payloads or sabotage features.",
