  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard WSGI to ASGI adapter with no malicious intent or security flaws. It is well-structured, with no suspicious behaviors or obfuscation. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The security risk is minimal, around 0.1, reflecting typical concerns for middleware but no inherent vulnerabilities."
