{
  "purpose": "The code wraps a WSGI application to enable its operation as an ASGI application, facilitating asynchronous handling of HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "The code reads incoming HTTP request data via the 'receive' coroutine, and reads headers from the 'scope' object.",
  "sinks": "The code sends responses using the 'send' function, particularly through the 'sync_send' method, including response headers and body content.",
  "flows": "Input data from 'receive' feeds into 'body' (SpooledTemporaryFile), which is then used in 'build_environ' to create WSGI environment; WSGI app generates output which is sent via 'sync_send' to the client.",
  "anomalies": "The code employs 'SpooledTemporaryFile' for request body handling, which is standard. It encodes/decodes headers and scope data but uses common practices. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The 'run_wsgi_app' runs the WSGI app asynchronously but does not execute any external or network code. No obfuscated or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard WSGI to ASGI adapter, utilizing well-known libraries like 'asgiref'. It carefully manages request data, constructs WSGI environment, and handles responses with proper thread synchronization. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The handling of request and response data appears legitimate and typical for such adapters.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate WSGI to ASGI wrapper with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It follows standard practices for converting between WSGI and ASGI protocols, and there are no anomalies or suspicious signals.",
