{
  "purpose": "This code implements a WSGI to ASGI adapter, enabling WSGI applications to run within ASGI servers by wrapping request handling, environment construction, and response streaming.",
  "sources": "Reads incoming HTTP request data via 'receive' messages, headers from scope, and request body from 'body' stream.",
  "sinks": "Sends response start and body messages through the 'send' callable, potentially exposing response headers and data.",
  "flows": "Request data flows from 'receive' into the request body buffer, then through 'build_environ' into the WSGI application, with responses sent via 'send' after processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Uses standard libraries and practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a WSGI to ASGI adapter, utilizing 'asgiref' for async sync bridging, 'SpooledTemporaryFile' for request buffering, and standard environment setup. It handles request parsing, environment creation, and response streaming correctly, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The 'start_response' method manages response headers and status, and the response is streamed back to the client appropriately. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code's structure and logic are clear and align with common patterns for such adapters.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard WSGI to ASGI adapter with no malicious intent or security flaws. It is well-structured, with no suspicious behaviors or obfuscation. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The security risk is minimal, around 0.1, reflecting typical concerns for middleware but no inherent vulnerabilities.",
