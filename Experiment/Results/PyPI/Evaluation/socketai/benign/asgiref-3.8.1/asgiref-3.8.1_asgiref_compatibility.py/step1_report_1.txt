{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to identify and convert legacy double-callable ASGI applications into single-callable format for compatibility.",
  "sources": "The code reads attributes of application objects (e.g., _asgi_single_callable, _asgi_double_callable), and calls application(scope) to instantiate applications.",
  "sinks": "The code executes application(scope) and awaits the instance, which could be a potential sink if application is maliciously crafted to execute harmful code during instantiation or invocation.",
  "flows": "The functions check attributes to determine application type (source), then potentially call application(scope) and await the result (sink), which could execute arbitrary code if application is malicious.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code relies on standard inspect and coroutine detection methods; no obfuscated or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for detecting whether an application object is double-callable and converting it into a single-callable form. It uses standard inspection and coroutine detection, with no suspicious attribute access or code execution. The application() invocation could be a risk if the application object is maliciously crafted to perform harmful operations during instantiation or invocation, but this is typical for such middleware utility functions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. The code is straightforward and follows standard patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a utility for ASGI application compatibility with no evident malicious intent. The only potential risk lies in executing application(scope) if the application object is maliciously crafted, but this is a common pattern in ASGI middleware. Overall, the code appears benign and standard.",
