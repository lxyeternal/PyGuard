  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's behavior, potential risks, and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the utility functions for ASGI compatibility.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** The main sink is invoking `application(scope)` and awaiting the result, which could execute arbitrary code if `application` is maliciously crafted.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation; standard inspection and coroutine detection. The risk lies in executing potentially malicious `application(scope)`.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The conclusion is appropriate; the code is benign, with a low security risk (0.2). Malware score is 0, obfuscated 0.\n\n**Score suggestion:** The current scores (malware=0, securityRisk=0.2) seem reasonable. The risk score is low because this pattern is typical in middleware and not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, standard attribute and type checks.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Creates new async functions and calls `application(scope)`. Again, potential execution of malicious code if `application` is crafted maliciously.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code; standard reflection. No obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Benign utility; scores (malware=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n\n**Score suggestion:** No change needed; scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar utility functions with attribute inspection and wrapping.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Wraps double-callable applications into async functions that invoke `application(scope)`.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns; standard approach.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, benign code. Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Score suggestion:** No change needed; consistent with the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard inspection.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Calls `application(scope)` within the wrapper, which could execute malicious code if `application` is malicious.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code; typical pattern.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious behavior detected; scores (malware=0, securityRisk=0) are reasonable.\n\n**Score suggestion:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Invokes `application(scope)` during wrapping.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns; standard practice.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, with a low security risk score (0.2), which is appropriate given the potential for executing untrusted code.\n\n**Score suggestion:** The current scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above 0 in some reports (0.2), reflecting the potential risk if `application` is malicious, which is inherent in any code that executes user-provided callables.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\nGiven the analysis, the code is a standard utility for ASGI compatibility. It involves dynamic invocation of potentially untrusted application objects, but this is typical in middleware and server frameworks. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (low, inherent risk due to execution of external callables, but not malicious)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Suggested Value |\n|------------------|-----------------|\n| Malware          | 0               |\n| Obfuscated       | 0               |\n| Security Risk    | 0.2             |\n\nThe current reports' assessments are aligned with this conclusion. The code is benign but executes external callables, which always carries some risk in untrusted environments, justifying a low risk score.",
