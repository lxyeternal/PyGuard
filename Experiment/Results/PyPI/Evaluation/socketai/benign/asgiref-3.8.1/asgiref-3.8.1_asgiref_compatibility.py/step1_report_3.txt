{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to identify and convert double-callable (legacy-style) ASGI applications into single-callable ones for compatibility purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function attributes (e.g., _asgi_single_callable, _asgi_double_callable), object types (inspect.isclass), and the __call__ method of application objects.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the 'new_application' async function which calls the application instance and awaits it, and the potential transformation of application objects that could be invoked in an unsafe manner.",
  "flows": "The functions identify application types via attributes or class inspection; if double-callable, they are wrapped into a new async application that calls the original application instance; the flow involves checking attributes, class types, and function call behavior, then potentially transforming into a safe single-callable form.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code relies on standard introspection and transformation patterns. No obfuscated code or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility for handling ASGI application callable styles. It uses attributes, class checks, and function introspection to determine application type, then wraps double-callable applications into a single-callable async function. All logic appears benign and aligned with typical Python web framework compatibility code. No external data input or insecure data handling is present. The functions do not perform any network operations, data leakage, or security-critical actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module for compatibility transformation in ASGI applications. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. Its purpose is to facilitate backwards compatibility by wrapping callables appropriately.",
