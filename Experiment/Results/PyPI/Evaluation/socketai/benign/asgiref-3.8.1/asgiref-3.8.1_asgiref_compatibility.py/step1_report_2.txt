{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for handling and transforming ASGI applications to ensure they are in a single-callable format, mainly for backward compatibility.",
  "sources": "The code reads attributes from application objects (getattr, hasattr), inspects if an object is a class (inspect.isclass), and accesses application.__call__ for coroutine detection.",
  "sinks": "The code constructs and returns new async functions, and calls application(scope) to instantiate applications, which could potentially execute code during instantiation.",
  "flows": "Application attribute checks -> Application type inspection -> Possibly wrapping application in a new async function that calls application(scope) -> Awaiting the resulting instance",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code patterns detected. The code uses standard Python reflection and coroutine detection functions. No external network or data leaks are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily inspects application objects for their callable nature and coroutine status. It conditionally transforms double-callable applications into single-callable ones by wrapping them in an async function that instantiates and calls the application. The functions rely on standard Python features and do not perform any data leaks, network communication, or file operations. No obfuscation or unusual code constructs are present. All operations appear consistent with a utility module intended for compatibility handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for managing ASGI application callability, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It uses standard Python practices and does not include any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
