{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to identify and convert legacy double-callable ASGI applications into single-callable ones, ensuring backward compatibility.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources; the code interacts with application objects and their attributes, particularly application.__call__.",
  "sinks": "The code invokes application(scope), which could potentially execute untrusted code if application is malicious or compromised.",
  "flows": "Application object -> check attributes and type -> possibly wrap in new_application that calls application(scope) -> await instance(receive, send).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. Use of inspect.isclass and attribute checks are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs type and attribute checks on application objects to determine if they are double- or single-callable. It then defines a wrapper to convert double-callable applications into single-callable ones. The key operation is invoking application(scope), which could be risky if application is malicious, but this is a standard pattern for handling application callables in ASGI servers. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are evident. The code's purpose is to ensure compatibility rather than execute any malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a utility module for handling ASGI application callables with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The invocation of application(scope) could be a concern if application is malicious, but this is expected behavior in ASGI environments. Overall, the code appears safe and purpose-driven.",
