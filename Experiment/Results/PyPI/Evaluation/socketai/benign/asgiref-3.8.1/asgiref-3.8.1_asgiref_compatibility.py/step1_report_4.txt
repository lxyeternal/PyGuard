  "purpose": "Utility functions to identify and convert legacy double-callable ASGI applications into single-callable ones for compatibility.",
  "sources": "Inspection of application objects for attributes, class type checks, and calling application.__call__ to determine callability.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code manipulates application callables but does not perform external data transmission or execute untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Application object is inspected for attributes and type; conversion functions generate new callables without external input or data flow to external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Use of inspect and dynamic callable wrapping is standard for this context.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for handling ASGI application callables, including checks for legacy 'double-callable' applications and conversion to single-callable format. It employs attribute checks and class type inspections, which are standard. No external data input, external network access, or data leaks are present. The use of dynamic application wrapping is typical for such frameworks. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard utility for handling ASGI application callables. There are no indicators of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It simply performs object inspection and function wrapping for compatibility purposes.",
