{
  "purpose": "This code assigns a version string to the __version__ variable, a common practice in Python packages for version tracking.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input, environment variables, or data sources; it is a static assignment.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code is purely a static assignment.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code contains only a simple assignment statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static assignment of a version string to __version__, with no external inputs, dynamic code, or malicious constructs. All reports correctly identify this as benign. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version declaration with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports and scores accurately reflect this. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
