  "purpose": "Test harness for running and interacting with an ASGI application in a controlled environment.",
  "sources": "Input is received via input_queue (messages sent through send_input), and application scope data provided during initialization. No external untrusted data sources are directly read within this code.",
  "sinks": "Output messages are retrieved from output_queue (receive_output, receive_nothing). No sinks appear to send data externally, though the queues themselves could hold sensitive data if misused.",
  "flows": "Messages are sent to the application via input_queue.put (send_input), processed asynchronously, and responses are retrieved from output_queue.get (receive_output). Application scope and contextvars are used internally but not externally.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No use of dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious function calls. The code relies on standard asyncio patterns and context management.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes an asynchronous test environment for an ASGI application, utilizing asyncio queues, contextvars, and standard timeout handling. It includes safe cleanup methods and exception handling for asynchronous tasks. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network connections, or backdoors. The use of contextvars appears to be for context isolation, and the overall structure is typical for such testing utilities. No suspicious or malicious code segments are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate testing utility for ASGI applications, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. It manages asynchronous tasks and queues securely and cleanly. There are no security risks or malicious behaviors detected.",
