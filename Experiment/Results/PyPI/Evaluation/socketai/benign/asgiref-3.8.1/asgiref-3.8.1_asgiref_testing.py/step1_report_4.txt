{
  "purpose": "The code provides a testing utility for running and interacting with an ASGI application in an asynchronous environment, enabling message sending and receiving for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Input messages via `send_input`; scope parameter in constructor; internal queues and context variables.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, output messages from `receive_output`; exceptions raised during future handling; cleanup in `stop()`.",
  "flows": "Input message sent via `send_input` → stored in `input_queue` → processed by application → output placed in `output_queue` → retrieved by `receive_output`.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. The code uses standard asyncio patterns and context management. No obfuscated code or malicious network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard asynchronous testing utility for an ASGI application. It manages task lifecycle, message queues, and contextvars to prevent leaks. No signs of data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious backdoors are present. The use of asyncio and contextvars appears appropriate for testing purposes. There are no suspicious network operations, credential handling, or hidden functionalities. The overall structure and content are consistent with typical testing helpers.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign asynchronous test harness for ASGI applications. No malicious intent or behavior detected. It performs standard message queue handling, task management, and context cleanup without any suspicious or malicious code.",
