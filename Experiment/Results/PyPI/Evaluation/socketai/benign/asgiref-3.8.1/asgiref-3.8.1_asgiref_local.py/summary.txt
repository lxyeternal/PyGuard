  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure utility for managing context-sensitive local data in asynchronous and threaded environments. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1), justified by the utility's benign nature and minimal residual risk."
