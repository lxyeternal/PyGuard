{
  "purpose": "Provides context-aware local storage for asynchronous and threaded Python code, combining contextvars and threading.local for flexible data management.",
  "sources": "Attribute access and modification via internal storage objects (_data, _storage), which are manipulated during attribute get/set/del operations.",
  "sinks": "Attribute accessors (__getattr__, __setattr__, __delattr__) that read from or write to storage objects, potentially affecting internal state but not external systems.",
  "flows": "Attribute operations flow through internal storage objects, with context management ensuring data is scoped correctly per thread or async task.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity detected. The code uses standard modules and patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a thread- and async-aware local storage utility using contextvars and threading.local. It manages internal state safely across threads and async tasks, with proper locking and context handling. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation are present. The design is standard and well-structured, with attribute access transparently managing internal storage. The security implications are minimal, primarily related to correct usage rather than inherent vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure utility for managing context-sensitive local data in asynchronous and threaded environments. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1), justified by the utility's benign nature and minimal residual risk.",
