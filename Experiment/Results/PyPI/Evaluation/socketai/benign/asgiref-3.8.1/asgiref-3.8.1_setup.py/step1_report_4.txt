  "purpose": "To set up and install a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'setup' function from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "The 'setup()' function call, which executes the package setup process.",
  "flows": "Import of 'setup' from setuptools → execution of setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setup' function from the 'setuptools' package and calls it without any arguments or additional configuration. This is a typical pattern for Python package setup scripts. No data input is read from external sources, nor are there any suspicious behaviors such as network access, data leakage, or malicious code injection. The simplicity and standard use of the setup() function suggest no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
