  "purpose": "Provides an asyncio-compatible timeout context manager for applying timeouts to asynchronous code blocks.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration parameters (timeout, loop), retrieves current asyncio task, accesses loop time, and manages task cancellation.",
  "sinks": "Cancels the current asyncio task upon timeout, which could interrupt ongoing operations; no other untrusted data flows detected.",
  "flows": "Initialization of timeout object -> entering context -> scheduling task cancellation -> exiting context -> cancel task if timeout occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; the implementation follows standard asyncio timeout management. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard asyncio timeout context manager, managing task cancellation after a specified timeout. It retrieves the current task, sets cancellation handlers, and cancels tasks upon timeout, which is normal behavior for such a utility. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or covert data leaks. The warnings about deprecated loop argument are standard deprecation notices. The logic is straightforward and adheres common asyncio patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of an asyncio timeout context manager, with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks identified. It serves its intended purpose without suspicious activity.",
