  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the security implications, scoring consistency, and any potential issues.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports conclude that the code is purely type definitions, data structures, and protocols for ASGI applications.\n- No runtime data processing, external connections, or untrusted data handling are present.\n- No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code is consistent with standard ASGI interface definitions used in web frameworks.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the analysis. Since there's no malicious code, this seems appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code's clarity and lack of obfuscation.\n- **Security risk scores:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable because the code only defines types and protocols, not executable logic or data handling that could introduce risks.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The reports are consistent in their assessments. They uniformly identify the code as benign, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- The scores are reasonable and aligned with the content.\n\n**Conclusion and my assessment:**\n- The code is a standard set of type definitions for ASGI applications.\n- There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The high confidence (1) in all reports is justified.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Final note:** The reports are thorough and accurate. No changes are necessary.",
