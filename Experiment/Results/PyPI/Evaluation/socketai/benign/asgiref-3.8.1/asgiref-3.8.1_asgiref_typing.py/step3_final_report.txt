{
  "purpose": "The code defines type annotations, data structures, and protocols for ASGI application interfaces, including HTTP, WebSocket, and lifespan scopes and events.",
  "sources": "Type definitions, class declarations, and conditional imports for version compatibility; no runtime data or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data handling that could lead to leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "Static type annotations serve as interface definitions; there are no data flows or runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present; the code is straightforward and declarative.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of TypedDicts, Protocols, and type aliases for defining ASGI application scopes and events. It includes conditional imports for compatibility, but no executable logic, data processing, or external connections. The structure aligns with standard ASGI specifications. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The code is purely structural, intended for static type checking, and does not handle untrusted data or perform runtime operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of type definitions for ASGI applications, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All evidence points to it being a safe, purely structural module used for type hinting and interface specification.",
