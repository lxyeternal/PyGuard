  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as a set of type definitions, data structures, and protocols for ASGI applications.\n- They consistently state that the code is purely declarative, with no runtime logic, data processing, external connections, or handling of untrusted data.\n- No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are observed.\n- The confidence level is high (1), and all reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Assessment of Malware, Obfuscated, and Risk Scores:**\n\n1. **Malware Score:**\n   - All reports explicitly mention the absence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or covert channels.\n   - The code is solely for defining types and interfaces.\n   - **Conclusion:** Malware score should be **0**.\n\n2. **Obfuscated Score:**\n   - No obfuscation, complex or suspicious code constructs are present.\n   - The code is straightforward, with conditional imports for version compatibility.\n   - **Conclusion:** Obfuscated score should be **0**.\n\n3. **Risk Score:**\n   - Since there are no signs of malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or risky behavior, the overall security risk is negligible.\n   - The code is purely structural, serving as type annotations for a web framework.\n   - **Conclusion:** Risk score should be **0**.\n\n**Any discrepancies or unreasonable scores?**\n- The reports uniformly assign zero or very low scores, which aligns with the analysis.\n- No report suggests any reason for elevated scores.\n\n**Final Justification:**\n- The code is standard, well-structured, and intended for static type checking.\n- It does not process untrusted data, perform external communication, or contain any code that could be exploited.\n- The high confidence and consensus reinforce the benign assessment.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nBased on the detailed review, all evidence points to this code being a safe, standard set of type definitions for ASGI applications with no malicious or risky elements.",
