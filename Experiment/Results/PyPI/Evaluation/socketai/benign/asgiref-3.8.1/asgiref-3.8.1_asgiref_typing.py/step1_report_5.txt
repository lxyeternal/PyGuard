{
  "purpose": "This code defines type annotations and data structures for an ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) application, including scope definitions, event types, and protocols used in asynchronous web server communications.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (sys, typing, typing_extensions), and defines data classes, type aliases, and protocols. No external inputs or data reading mechanisms are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data flows into sensitive operations are evident; the code only establishes data structures and type annotations.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow or processing is implemented; the code only sets up type definitions and class structures, with no executable logic or data processing flows.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains extensive type definitions and class protocols with no apparent anomalies. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly consists of type definitions, data structures, and protocols for ASGI applications. It imports standard libraries, with conditional imports based on Python version. All classes are TypedDict or Protocols defining expected data shapes for web request/response cycles. There are no functions executing runtime logic, data parsing, or external interactions. The structure is consistent with standard ASGI application interface design. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of type definitions and interface protocols for ASGI applications. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. Its purpose is to define data structures for asynchronous web server interactions without executing any sensitive or unsafe operations.",
