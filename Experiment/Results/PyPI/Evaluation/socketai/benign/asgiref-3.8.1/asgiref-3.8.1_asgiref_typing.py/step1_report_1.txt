{
  "purpose": "This code defines data structures, type annotations, and protocols for ASGI application scope and events used in asynchronous web frameworks.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and typing extensions, and defines class and type structures.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; the code only defines types and classes without processing untrusted input.",
  "flows": "N/A – the code does not process or handle data flows; it only defines data structures and protocols.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of TypedDict and Protocol definitions for ASGI scopes and events, with conditional imports based on Python version. No runtime input handling, data processing, or external connections are present. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or covert channels. The structure is consistent with standard ASGI interface definitions used in web frameworks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign set of type definitions and protocols for ASGI applications. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or security risks.",
