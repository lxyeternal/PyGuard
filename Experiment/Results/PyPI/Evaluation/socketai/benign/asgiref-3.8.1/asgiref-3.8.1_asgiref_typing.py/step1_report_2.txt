  "purpose": "Define type annotations and data structures for ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) protocols and events used in web frameworks.",
  "sources": "Imports sys, typing, and typing_extensions; defines TypedDict classes and type aliases for ASGI scopes and events.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data processing or external communication present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only declares data structures and type interfaces.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code is purely type definition and interface setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of type definitions and data structures for ASGI protocols. It imports standard modules and typing utilities, defines various TypedDicts for different scope and event types, and sets up type aliases for different application interfaces. There are no functions processing input or output data, no network operations, or any dynamic code execution. All constructs are static type annotations intended for framework use, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured set of type definitions for ASGI applications. It contains no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data leaks, or security risks. It is safe for use in a codebase, serving solely as type annotations and interface definitions.",
