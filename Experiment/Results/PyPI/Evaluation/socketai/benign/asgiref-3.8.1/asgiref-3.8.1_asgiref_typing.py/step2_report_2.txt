  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess their findings, scores, and any inconsistencies.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports conclude that the code is a set of type definitions, data structures, and protocols for ASGI applications.\n- No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are identified.\n- The code is static, purely structural, and used for type hinting.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code is purely type annotations and class definitions; it does not process untrusted data, perform external communication, or execute runtime logic.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious code.\n- No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns.\n- Conditional import of `NotRequired` is standard for Python version compatibility.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- **Logical correctness:** The code appears correct and well-structured for its purpose.\n- **Potential improvements:** Not directly related to security, but perhaps adding comments or documentation could improve clarity. However, this does not impact security.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- All reports assign:\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n- These are reasonable given the static, type-only nature of the code.\n\n### Justification of risk scores:\n- Since the code is purely type definitions, the risk score should remain very low, close to 0.\n- The malware score is correctly 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- The overall security risk is 0, as there's no runtime or data processing.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Claims about potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:** None of the reports suggest any vulnerabilities; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n- **Consistency of scores:** The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n**Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The code's purpose is purely structural and interface definition, which inherently carries no security risk.\n- No external or runtime behaviors are present that could introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. Based on the provided code and analysis, I agree with the assessments that this is a benign, standard set of type definitions for ASGI applications with no security concerns.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the scores as they are: malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.",
