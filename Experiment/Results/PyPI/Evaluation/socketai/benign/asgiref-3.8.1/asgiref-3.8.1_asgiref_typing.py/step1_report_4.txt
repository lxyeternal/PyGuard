  "purpose": "Define data structures and type annotations for ASGI-based web server communication protocols and events.",
  "sources": "Standard library imports (sys, typing, typing_extensions); type annotations for classes and functions.",
  "sinks": "None observed; the code only defines types and data structures without executing any actions or processing untrusted data.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow execution or data handling logic is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs are present. The code is solely for defining types and data structures.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and conditionally imports 'NotRequired' for type annotations based on Python version. It then defines various TypedDict classes representing different ASGI scope types, events, and protocols, including HTTP, WebSocket, and lifespan events. All classes and types are purely declarative, serving as type hints and data models. No input processing, external data handling, or executable logic exists. The structure and content align with typical ASGI protocol definitions, with no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of data structure definitions for ASGI protocols and contains no executable or malicious code. It appears to be a standard, safe library component for type hinting in ASGI applications.",
