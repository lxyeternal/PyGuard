  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports describe the code as a set of type definitions, data structures, and protocols for ASGI applications.\n- They consistently note that the code is purely declarative, with no runtime logic, data processing, external connections, or handling of untrusted data.\n- No anomalies, secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, a security risk of 0, and high confidence that the code is benign.\n\n**Confirming the Code's Content:**\n- The code is a standard, well-structured set of TypedDicts, Protocols, and type aliases for defining ASGI scopes and events.\n- Conditional import of `NotRequired` for Python >= 3.11 is appropriate.\n- No executable logic, data handling, or external interactions are present.\n- The code aligns with typical ASGI interface specifications used in web frameworks.\n\n**Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:**\n- No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n- The code's structure and content are consistent with standard practices.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious constructs, or security issues.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 is appropriate; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Potential Risks and Assumptions:**\n- The reports correctly avoid assumptions about vulnerabilities, as the code is purely declarative.\n- No need to elevate risk scores or malware scores based on the current content.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, safe set of type definitions for ASGI applications.\n- No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The high confidence scores are justified.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- I concur with the provided scores: malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis code is benign and purely structural, serving as type annotations and interface definitions for ASGI frameworks.",
