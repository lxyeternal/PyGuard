{
  "purpose": "This code defines type annotations, data structures, and protocols for an ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) framework, specifically related to handling HTTP, WebSocket, and lifespan events in a Python web server environment.",
  "sources": "Constants and class definitions that describe the structure of various scope and event types, type annotations for callables and protocols.",
  "sinks": "None identified. No untrusted input is processed, nor are external connections or data outputs present in this code.",
  "flows": "The code establishes data schemas and protocols but does not include executable logic that processes untrusted data. The type definitions are used elsewhere in application logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present. The code is well-structured type annotation and data structure definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code purely consists of type definitions, class declarations, and protocol specifications to formalize data structures for an ASGI application. It conditionally imports 'NotRequired' for Python versions >= 3.11. No executable code, input handling, or external connections are present. It does not perform any operations that could be malicious. The design follows typical patterns for type safety and protocol definitions in asynchronous web servers. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data leakage mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of structured type definitions and protocols for an ASGI framework. It is benign, purely structural, and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard, well-formed module intended for use in a larger, safe web application context.",
