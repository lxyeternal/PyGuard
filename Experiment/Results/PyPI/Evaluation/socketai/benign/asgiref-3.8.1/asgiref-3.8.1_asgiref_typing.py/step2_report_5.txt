  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code consists solely of type definitions, class declarations, and protocol specifications for ASGI applications.\n   - No runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n   - No untrusted data handling, external network calls, or dynamic code execution are evident.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and thorough, correctly identifying that the code is purely structural and safe.\n   - No logical errors or misconceptions are apparent.\n   - The reports appropriately emphasize the absence of malicious behavior or security risks.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0.\n   - These scores are reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports indicate no malicious activity or security issues, a risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified.\n   - The code is purely type annotations and interface definitions, which do not pose security threats.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 in all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - No signs of malware, backdoors, or covert channels are present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are evidence-based, noting the static, structural nature of the code.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made without supporting evidence.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard, well-structured set of type definitions for ASGI applications.\n- It is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n\n**My Personal Estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Final notes:**\n- This code is safe and suitable for use as a foundational type interface in ASGI-based web frameworks.\n- No further action or concern is necessary.",
