{
  "purpose": "This code manages registration and removal of post-processing classes for a data sanitization library, using a catalogue to organize plugins.",
  "sources": "Input sources include function arguments: 'post_processor', 'autoload', 'index', and 'post_processor' as string or class type.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve registering and removing post-processors via the catalogue, which could lead to execution of malicious classes or modifications if untrusted data is used.",
  "flows": "Input arguments flow into registration/removal functions, influencing catalogue entries and class attributes. No external data sources or network activity are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns detected; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code performs standard plugin registration tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to register and remove post-processors for a sanitization framework. It uses type checks and raises exceptions for invalid inputs. The 'catalogue' library manages plugin entries. No suspicious dynamic execution, external data retrieval, or malicious intent is evident. The operations are standard plugin management procedures, with no indications of malicious activity or data leakage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical plugin registration and removal utility for a data processing library. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The operations are straightforward, with proper input validation and no suspicious side effects.",
