{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to register and remove post-processor classes in a plugin system for the 'scrubadub' package, facilitating dynamic management of post-processing components.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from function parameters: 'post_processor' (class or string) in 'remove_post_processor', and 'post_processor' with optional 'autoload' and 'index' in 'register_post_processor'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data directly or perform actions based on untrusted input are present.",
  "flows": "The flow involves validating input parameters, setting attributes on classes, and registering/removing entries in a catalogue. Data flows from function inputs to catalogue registration/removal actions.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs dynamic registration/removal of classes; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code are evident. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are used. The catalogue handling uses internal functions (_remove) that could be sensitive, but are standard for plugin systems.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a plugin management system for post-processors, validating class types, setting attributes, and managing a catalogue of components. It does not process untrusted data or perform any network, file, or system modifications. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. The code relies on external libraries like 'inspect' and 'catalogue' but uses them in a typical manner. No anomalies indicating malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward plugin registration system with no evident malicious behavior or security risks. It handles class registration and removal securely without processing untrusted data or executing harmful operations.",
