  "purpose": "Manage registration and removal of PostProcessor classes via a plugin catalog system.",
  "sources": "Class objects passed to register_post_processor, class names or class objects passed to remove_post_processor.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Input class or class name -> validation checks -> attribute assignment -> catalog registration/removal.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; straightforward validation and catalog interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard plugin management tasks: validating class types, setting optional attributes, and registering/removing classes in a catalogue. It uses inspect.isclass for validation, which is appropriate. No external data sources, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The interactions with the catalogue are typical for plugin systems. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscated patterns are detected. The security implications are minimal, as the code does not execute untrusted code or perform external operations. The potential for misuse exists if untrusted classes are registered, but the code validates class types, mitigating this risk. Overall, the code is a legitimate plugin management utility with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured plugin registration/removal utility with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The malware score is correctly set to 0, obfuscated score to 0, and the security risk score is appropriately low (~0.1). The confidence level is high. No modifications are necessary.",
