{
  "purpose": "The code manages registration and removal of post-processor classes for a data sanitization library, using a plugin architecture with a catalogue for dynamic loading.",
  "sources": "Imports from inspect, catalogue, and typing modules; function parameters; attribute access on post_processor objects",
  "sinks": "Calls to catalogue.register and catalogue._remove which modify the plugin registry; attribute assignment to post_processor.autoload and post_processor.index",
  "flows": "Function inputs (post_processor, autoload, index, post_processor string) -> attribute modifications or catalogue registration/removal",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code, and no unusual patterns or hidden behaviors detected. Usage of external catalogue library is standard for plugin management.",
  "analysis": "The code provides functions for registering and removing post-processor classes via a catalogue system. It performs class validation, sets optional attributes, and modifies a plugin registry. The logic involves standard validation checks, attribute assignment, and catalogue operations. There are no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code relies on external library functions and typical plugin architecture practices, with proper validation and error handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate plugin management system for a sanitization library. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The code is well-structured for its purpose and does not contain hidden or harmful elements.",
