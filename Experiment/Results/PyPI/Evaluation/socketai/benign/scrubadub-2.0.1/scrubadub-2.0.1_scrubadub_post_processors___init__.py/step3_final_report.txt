  "sources": "Local module imports: .catalogue, .base, .filth_replacer, .prefix_suffix, .remover",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external communication; purely static import statements",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow or untrusted data handling present",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; straightforward import statements",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, with no executable logic, data processing, or external communication. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns. The code is typical for a modular Python package, and all import statements are from local modules, indicating standard structure. No suspicious behavior or security risks are evident. The minimal risk score (0.1 in one report) is likely an overestimation; given the benign nature, it should be set to zero. Malware and obfuscation scores are correctly assigned as zero across all reports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only import statements with no malicious or suspicious activity. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate, except for a minor adjustment in one report where the security risk score should be lowered from 0.1 to 0.0. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
