{
  "purpose": "This code imports classes and functions from local modules, likely for a data processing or text manipulation package.",
  "sources": "No external data sources are read; only local module imports are present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling points are visible; no output, network, or file operations are performed here.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only performs imports and does not execute data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or unusual code constructs. The code is simple and standard for module imports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions and classes from local modules within the same package directory. The imported names suggest functionality related to post-processing and text manipulation. There are no signs of obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious behavior. The structure appears standard for a Python package's __init__.py or similar module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and only imports components from local modules without performing any malicious actions. There are no indicators of malware, security risks, or anomalies based solely on these import statements.",
