  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the logic, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a straightforward set of import statements from local modules.\n- No executable logic, data handling, network activity, or external data sources are present.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs are observed.\n- All reports agree that the code appears benign and standard for a modular Python package.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Accurate; it's just import statements.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- **Confidence:** 1 (high certainty)\n- **Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same as above; import statements only.\n- **Scores:** Malware and risk are 0, consistent.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9, slightly less but still high.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Both 0, consistent.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same; no external data or malicious activity.\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0.1 — slightly higher, but still very low.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0.1, which is acceptable given the minimal potential concern.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Again, only import statements.\n- **Scores:** All zero or minimal risk, consistent.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports correctly identify that this code contains only import statements with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in reasoning:**  \n  No, all reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n- **Scores and justifications:**  \n  The malware scores are all zero, which is justified given the benign nature. The risk scores are very low or zero, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Higher than 0.5 risk scores?**  \n  No, all are below 0.5, reflecting minimal or no security concern.\n\n- **Malware scores higher than 0?**  \n  No, all are zero, consistent with the analysis.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No, all reports rely on observable facts—only import statements.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a standard import block with no malicious or security issues.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0.05 (very minimal, mostly due to the nature of import statements, but practically negligible)\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, and the current scoring reflects that accurately.",
