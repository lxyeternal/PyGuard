  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the provided code snippets, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements from local modules.\n- No executable code, data flow, or external communication is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns.\n- The code appears to be part of a modular Python package, likely for post-processing functionalities.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; import statements from local modules.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; no malicious behavior or security risks.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)\n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n  - SecurityRisk: 0 (correct)\n- **Confidence:** 1 (appropriate)\n- **Note:** No issues here.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; standard import statements.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)\n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n  - SecurityRisk: 0 (correct)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 (reasonable)\n- **Note:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; import statements.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate; standard modular import pattern.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)\n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n  - SecurityRisk: 0 (correct)\n- **Confidence:** 1 (appropriate)\n- **Note:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; import statements.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)\n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n  - SecurityRisk: 0.1 (possibly slightly high)\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n- **Discussion:** The report assigns a small security risk (0.1) despite the code being just imports. Since no data flow or external interaction exists, this is likely an overestimation. A score of 0.0 would be more appropriate unless there's an unmentioned context.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)\n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n  - SecurityRisk: 0 (correct)\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n- **Note:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, consistent with straightforward import statements.\n- **Risk score:** Most are 0, except report 4 which is 0.1. Given the code's simplicity, this should be lowered to 0.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear import statements)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk from import statements alone)\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Adjust report 4's securityRisk score from 0.1 to 0** to better reflect the benign nature.\n- **Maintain all other scores as they are.**\n\nThis thorough review confirms that the code is purely structural, with no security concerns based solely on these snippets.",
