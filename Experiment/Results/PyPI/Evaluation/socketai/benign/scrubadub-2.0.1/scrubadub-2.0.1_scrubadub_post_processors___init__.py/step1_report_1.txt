{
  "purpose": "The code imports various modules and classes related to post-processing functionalities, likely for a larger data processing or transformation system.",
  "sources": "Import statements pulling functions and classes from local modules: .catalogue, .base, .filth_replacer, .prefix_suffix, and .remover.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system commands in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or untrusted input processing present in this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns are observed. The code structure is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, suggesting a modular design. No execution logic, data handling, or user input is present. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues. As it is only importing functions and classes, it does not pose any apparent risk by itself.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import block establishing dependencies for a post-processing framework. It does not contain malicious intent or security risks. The code is standard, clean, and unremarkable from a security perspective.",
