  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for post-processing Filth objects in a data processing pipeline.",
  "sources": "No explicit input or data reading sources; relies on external calls to process_filth with a list of Filth objects.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this is a class definition with an unimplemented method.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code structure appears standard for a base class with an optional name parameter.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class PostProcessor with attributes for name, autoload, and index. The constructor allows optional renaming. The process_filth method is meant to be overridden by subclasses, raising NotImplementedError if called directly. There are no signs of data leaks, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. No suspicious code patterns, obfuscated code, or unsafe data handling detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard base class intended for extension. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as a placeholder for subclasses to implement processing logic.",
