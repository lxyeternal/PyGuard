  "purpose": "Utility functions and classes for managing 'Filth' objects, generating fake data, grouping, and evaluation metrics for testing detection systems.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters, internal attributes, and external libraries (faker, pandas, sklearn). No external data flows or untrusted input sources beyond standard library usage.",
  "sinks": "Data processed within pandas DataFrames and sklearn metrics; no external network, file system, or system call operations observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through pandas and sklearn for analysis and reporting; no external or untrusted data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily utility-focused, designed for generating, grouping, and evaluating 'Filth' objects in testing environments. It uses standard libraries and practices, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The high confidence scores reflect the benign nature of the code. No external data leaks, network operations, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, benign, and intended for testing and evaluation purposes. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), consistent with the purpose of the code. No further action is necessary.",
  "model": "gpt-4.1-nano"
