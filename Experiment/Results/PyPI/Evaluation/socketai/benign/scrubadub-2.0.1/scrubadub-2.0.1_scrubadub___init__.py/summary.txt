  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for PII detection and redaction, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score should remain at 0. The slight variation in risk scores (0.1-0.2) in some reports is justified as cautious, considering potential internal behavior of the Scrubber class, which is not visible here."
