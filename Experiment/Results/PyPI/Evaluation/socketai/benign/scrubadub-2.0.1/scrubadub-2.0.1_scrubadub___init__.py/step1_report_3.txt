{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for cleaning and detecting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in text or documents using the Scrubber class, including listing detected filth.",
  "sources": "Code imports modules (.scrubbers, .filth, .detectors, .post_processors) and defines functions that instantiate Scrubber objects, which internally access input text or documents provided as parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the instantiation and use of Scrubber objects to process text, which could lead to data exposure if the Scrubber's methods send data over the network or log sensitive information. However, the code itself does not contain explicit network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Input data (text or documents) flows into functions, which instantiate Scrubber objects; these objects process the data via methods like clean, clean_documents, iter_filth, and iter_filth_documents, resulting in outputs with redacted or detected PII.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are evident. The code uses standard class instantiations and method calls without obfuscation or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines wrapper functions around the Scrubber class to process text and documents for PII detection and redaction. It imports modules from the same package but does not perform any network, file system, or credential handling within this snippet. There are no suspicious behaviors, hidden backdoors, or malicious logic. The functions appear to serve legitimate purposes related to data redaction and detection, with no indications of data leakage or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of PII detection and redaction functions using the Scrubber class. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks within this code fragment. It appears to be a legitimate utility module for processing text and documents for PII.",
