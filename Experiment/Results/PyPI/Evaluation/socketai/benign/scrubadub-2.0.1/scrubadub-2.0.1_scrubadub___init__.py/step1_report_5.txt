{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to detect and redact Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in text or documents, using a Scrubber class and associated modules.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters: 'text' for the 'clean' and 'list_filth' functions; 'documents' for 'clean_documents', 'list_filth_documents'. It also imports internal modules.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs processed text or lists of 'Filth' objects. No sinks involve untrusted data being sent externally or causing side effects.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from function parameters into 'Scrubber' instance methods ('clean', 'iter_filth', etc.), which process and return sanitized text or detected 'Filth' objects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code structure and imports are standard. No dynamic execution or obfuscation evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports local modules related to 'scrubbers', 'filth', 'detectors', and 'post_processors' for PII detection and redaction. Functions create a 'Scrubber' object per call and invoke its methods to perform cleaning and detection. The methods accept input text or document collections, process them, and return sanitized results or detection lists. The code does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or execute external commands. The design appears to be a typical utility for PII redaction with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of PII detection and redaction utilities. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It functions solely to process text and documents for privacy purposes.",
