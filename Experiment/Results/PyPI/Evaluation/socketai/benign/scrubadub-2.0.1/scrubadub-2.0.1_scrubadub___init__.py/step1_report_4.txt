{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for sanitizing and detecting personally identifiable information (PII) in text documents, primarily through the Scrubber class and associated methods.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'text' and 'documents' in functions like 'clean', 'list_filth', and their variants.",
  "sinks": "Function calls to 'Scrubber' class methods, which internally process data; no external sinks are directly evident.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from function parameters into 'Scrubber' methods which perform the core processing, replacing or listing filth.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are present. The imports are standard for a module focused on text processing. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious code is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports local modules for 'scrubbers', 'filth', 'detectors', and 'post_processors', then defines utility functions for cleaning and listing filth (PII) in texts and documents. The functions instantiate a 'Scrubber' object and invoke its methods to perform sanitization or detection. The code is well-structured, with descriptive docstrings, and uses standard Python practices. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The import statements and function calls are typical for a text processing library. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a PII detection and redaction library. It contains no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It appears to be a benign, well-structured utility module for text sanitization.",
