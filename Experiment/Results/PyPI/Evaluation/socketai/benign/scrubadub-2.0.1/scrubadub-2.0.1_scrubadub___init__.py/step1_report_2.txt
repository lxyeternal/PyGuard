{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for sanitizing and detecting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in text and documents, mainly by using a Scrubber class to replace or list detected filth.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters: text, documents, and optional locale settings.",
  "sinks": "The code processes input data via the Scrubber class methods, which internally handle detection and redaction; no direct sinks for untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into Scrubber instances created within each function, then into methods like clean, clean_documents, iter_filth, and iter_filth_documents, with no external untrusted data effects outside this scope.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code uses standard class instantiations and method calls, with no dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The module primarily provides a wrapper around the Scrubber class for cleaning and listing PII data in texts and documents. The functions instantiate the Scrubber class and call its methods with provided parameters. There are no apparent suspicious behaviors, such as network access, file operations, or data exfiltration. The code appears to be standard, well-structured, and consistent with a data sanitization library. No signs of malicious intent or malicious code are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate data sanitization utility with no malicious behavior. It performs expected operations like redacting PII and listing detected filth using the Scrubber class. There are no anomalies or malicious indicators present.",
