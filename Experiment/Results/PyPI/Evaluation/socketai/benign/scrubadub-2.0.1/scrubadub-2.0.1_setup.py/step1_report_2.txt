{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for the 'scrubadub' Python package, used to define package metadata and dependencies for installation.",
  "sources": "Reading README file for long description, reading requirements files for dependencies, reading version info from __init__.py.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "flows": "Input from README and requirements files flows into package setup parameters; version info read from source code, but no untrusted input processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs standard setup tasks with proper file reads, no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The script reads static files for package description and dependencies, extracts version info from source code, and uses setuptools to define package setup parameters. There are no dynamic code executions, no data flows from untrusted sources, no suspicious patterns, and no hardcoded credentials or backdoors. All operations are standard for a setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs typical setup tasks safely and securely.",
