{
  "purpose": "The code is a standard Python package setup script that reads static files for metadata and configuration, then invokes setuptools.setup() to package the project.",
  "sources": "Reading README.rst, requirements files, and __init__.py for version info",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static file reads do not process external input at runtime",
  "flows": "Static file reads to gather metadata, no dynamic or external data flows",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward package setup with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code performs static file reads for package metadata, version, and dependencies. It does not execute untrusted code, connect to networks, or process external input dynamically. The logic is standard for Python packaging, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
