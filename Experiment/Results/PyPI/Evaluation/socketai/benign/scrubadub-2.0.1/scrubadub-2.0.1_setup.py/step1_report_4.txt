{
  "purpose": "The script sets up the package configuration for the 'scrubadub' Python project, including reading dependencies, version info, and metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "File reads: README.rst, requirements files, scrubadub/__init__.py; Data used for setup configuration such as version and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the code primarily reads files and sets up package metadata. No execution of untrusted data, network operations, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Reading README and requirements files -> extracting version info -> passing dependencies and metadata to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code patterns observed. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup procedures: reading documentation and dependencies from files, extracting version info from a source file, and configuring package installation parameters. All file operations are straightforward and controlled. No external data or untrusted inputs are processed at runtime. The code follows typical patterns for Python package setup scripts with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a conventional setup configuration for a Python package with no indications of malicious or maliciously intended code. It reads files and prepares package metadata securely without executing untrusted data.",
