{
  "purpose": "This code defines setup configuration for the 'scrubadub' Python package, including reading dependencies, version, and metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading README file, version line in __init__.py, package list files in 'requirements/python'.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or executes untrusted data directly; setup configurations are static.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; data is read from files for setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors identified.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup procedures: reading description, dependencies, version, and metadata. It reads files for configuration data and constructs the setup() call accordingly. There are no dynamic code executions, network connections, or data leaks present. The code is straightforward, adhering to common packaging practices, and does not contain obfuscated or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely reads configuration data and prepares the package for distribution.",
