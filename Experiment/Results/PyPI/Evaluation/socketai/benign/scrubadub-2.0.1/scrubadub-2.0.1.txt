The security risk is minimal, and the malware score should remain at 0. The obfuscated score is 0, reflecting clarity. The risk score can be conservatively set around 0.15–0.2, considering plugin flexibility but no actual vulnerabilities. The reports' scores are consistent and appropriate."

The security risk is minimal, and the malware score should remain at 0. The slight variation in risk scores (0.1-0.2) in some reports is justified as cautious, considering potential internal behavior of the Scrubber class, which is not visible here."

The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and overall security risk is negligible. The dependency on 'Filth' does not introduce risk in this context."
