{
  "purpose": "The code defines a 'Scrubber' class for detecting and removing personal information ('Filth') from text documents using various 'Detector' and 'PostProcessor' modules.",
  "sources": "The code reads input text data through methods like 'clean', 'clean_documents', and 'iter_filth'; it also accesses detector configurations and post-processor modules during initialization and addition/removal operations.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows into 'Detector' and 'PostProcessor' objects, which process text and 'Filth' objects; final cleaned text is produced via string concatenation and replacement. No evident data leaks or external data transmission occurs within this code.",
  "flows": "Sources include input text and detector/post-processor configurations; detectors generate 'Filth' objects (potentially untrusted), which are processed and merged; 'Filth' objects may modify the text, and the final cleaned text flows back as output.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. The code primarily manages detector and post-processor objects and performs text cleaning operations. No signs of malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured class for text sanitization using detectors and post-processors, managing detectors dynamically and processing 'Filth' objects. It employs standard design patterns, such as generator functions and dynamic class instantiation, without any obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or suspicious data handling. There are no signs of malware, secret backdoors, or external network activity. Its functions are focused solely on filtering and cleaning personal data from text inputs, with appropriate safeguards and error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a data scrubber system for personal information detection and removal. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks within this code fragment. Its structure and behavior are consistent with standard data processing libraries, with no suspicious signals.",
