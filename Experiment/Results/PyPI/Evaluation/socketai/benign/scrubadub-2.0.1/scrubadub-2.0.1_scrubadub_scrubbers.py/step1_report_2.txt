{
  "purpose": "The code defines a 'Scrubber' class used for identifying, processing, and cleaning personal information ('Filth') from text data using detectors and post-processors.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the parameters of methods like 'clean', 'clean_documents', and 'iter_filth'/'iter_filth_documents', primarily the 'text' parameter and the 'documents' collection.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data can reach potential sinks through 'Filth.replace_with()' method calls, where 'replacement_string' or dynamic replacements occur, and via data processing in 'clean', 'clean_documents', or 'iter_filth'.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'text' or 'documents' inputs through detectors that generate 'Filth' objects, which are then filtered, sorted, and optionally post-processed, with replacements being applied in '_replace_text' based on 'Filth' attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code constructs are evident. The code uses warnings for deprecated features and relies on standard class and method patterns. No suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation is present.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically implements a modular text sanitization framework, with clear source (input parameters), detector-driven extraction ('Filth'), and sink points where data is replaced or output generated. It includes safeguards like type checks and locale filtering. There is no evidence of hidden or malicious behavior. The design aligns with typical sanitization workflows. The use of warnings and flexible detector/post-processor registration suggests flexibility but not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a text scrubbing utility designed for privacy or data cleansing. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware signals are detected. The structure and logic are consistent with legitimate, security-oriented functionality.",
