  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured privacy-focused text sanitization library with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score should remain at 0. The obfuscated score is 0, reflecting clarity. The risk score can be conservatively set around 0.15–0.2, considering plugin flexibility but no actual vulnerabilities. The reports' scores are consistent and appropriate."
