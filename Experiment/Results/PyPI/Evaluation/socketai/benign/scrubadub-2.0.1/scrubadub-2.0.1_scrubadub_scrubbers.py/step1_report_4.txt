{
  "purpose": "The Scrubber class is designed to identify and remove personal or sensitive information ('Filth') from text documents using various detectors and post-processors.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from method parameters such as 'text', 'documents' (list or dict), and through detector iterators that process text content. No external untrusted sources or environment variables are directly read.",
  "sinks": "Processed data is transformed and returned via text replacement methods. The primary sink is the output string where filth is replaced, with no evidence of data being sent over network, saved to files, or otherwise leaked.",
  "flows": "Input text flows through detector iterators, where 'Filth' objects are identified; these 'Filth' objects are processed by post-processors; then the cleaned text is reconstructed by replacing 'Filth' segments. No external or untrusted data flows outside these transformations.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses warnings for deprecated parameters but does not include any hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The only minor concern is the deprecation warning about 'replace_with', but it is not malicious. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically loads detectors and post-processors, allowing dynamic addition and removal based on string identifiers or class instances. Detectors are instantiated with the current locale; post-processors are managed similarly. The core cleaning methods reconstruct text by replacing 'Filth' segments, with optional post-processing. No external network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code appears to perform data sanitization as intended. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data flows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of a content scrubbing system without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It securely processes input text, applying detectors and post-processors, and returns sanitized output. No evidence of malware, sabotage, or security risks was found.",
