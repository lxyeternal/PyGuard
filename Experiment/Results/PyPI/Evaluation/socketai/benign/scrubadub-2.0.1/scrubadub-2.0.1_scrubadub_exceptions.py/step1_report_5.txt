{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the Scrubadub library to handle various error scenarios.",
  "sources": "The code does not read external input or data; it only defines exception classes and a URL string.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only manages exceptions and messages.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials (beyond the URL which is benign), or unusual behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions used within the Scrubadub library. It includes a base exception with a URL, a Unicode-specific exception with a friendly message, and other exceptions for specific error cases. The __init__ methods set attributes, and __str__ or render methods format messages. No external data processing, input handling, or external connections are present. The URL embedded is benign and informational.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely structural, defining exception classes for error handling within a library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
