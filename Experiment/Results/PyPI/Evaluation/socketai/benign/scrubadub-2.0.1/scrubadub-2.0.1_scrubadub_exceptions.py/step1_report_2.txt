{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the scrubadub library, including error messages and handling logic.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs; exceptions are instantiated and used within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow paths involving untrusted data; exception messages are constructed for internal use only.",
  "flows": "Exception instantiation and string representation methods; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; the code is straightforward class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes inheriting from Exception. The __init__ and __str__ methods set up exception messages and attributes. The only potential concern is the use of string formatting with variables in __str__, but these are controlled internal messages. There is no user input, network access, or external data involved. No malware behavior, backdoors, or malicious logic is present. The code appears to be standard, harmless exception handling setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely defines custom exception classes with descriptive messages. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. It is a benign component of the larger scrubadub library.",
