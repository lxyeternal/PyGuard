{
  "purpose": "Defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for the scrubadub library, including messages and a URL for issue reporting.",
  "sources": "Class attribute 'issues_url' and string formatting within __str__ methods.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data input or output, no network calls, no dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; message formatting uses internal variables only.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward class definitions with static messages and URL.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions with controlled string formatting and static attributes. No external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The messages are static or use internal variables, and the URL is a benign link for issue tracking. The code is standard, safe, and free of obfuscation or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exceptions for a Python library, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. All signals indicate safe, straightforward exception handling code.",
