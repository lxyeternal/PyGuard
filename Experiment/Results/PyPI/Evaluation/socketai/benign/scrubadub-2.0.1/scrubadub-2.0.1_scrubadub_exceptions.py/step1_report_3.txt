{
  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions for the Scrubadub library to handle various error scenarios and provide user-friendly messages.",
  "sources": "Exception class constructors and methods, particularly in __init__ and __str__ methods, where string messages and attributes are set or rendered.",
  "sinks": "String formatting in the render() method, which could potentially be exploited if untrusted data is passed to __str__ methods, although in this code, the data is internally controlled.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of exception classes, calling __str__() to produce messages, which use string formatting with internal or controlled variables.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, such as network calls, file access, or dynamic code execution. The only potential concern is the use of string formatting with vars(self), but it is used here with controlled data and no external input.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for the Scrubadub library. The base class sets an issues URL and provides a render() method that formats messages. Subclasses override __str__() to return formatted error messages. All data used in string formatting appears to be internally controlled or static. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, such as network communication, code injection, or data exfiltration. The code structure is straightforward, focusing on exception handling and user messaging.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of exception class definitions designed to improve error messaging within the Scrubadub library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
