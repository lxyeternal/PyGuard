{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the Scrubadub library to handle specific error conditions and provide user guidance.",
  "sources": "Exception class constructors and methods that assign or generate messages; no external input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "String formatting within __str__ and render methods; no untrusted data sinks or data leaks identified.",
  "flows": "Exception instantiation leads to string rendering; no external data flows or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward and adheres to standard exception class patterns; no anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes inheriting from Python's Exception. The base class sets a URL attribute for issues. Some classes override __str__ to provide descriptive messages, with string formatting that only uses class attributes. There is no handling of external input, network activity, or code execution. The code appears to serve as a structured way to handle errors in the Scrubadub library, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for error handling within the Scrubadub library. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. It contains no obfuscated code, external data handling, or security vulnerabilities.",
