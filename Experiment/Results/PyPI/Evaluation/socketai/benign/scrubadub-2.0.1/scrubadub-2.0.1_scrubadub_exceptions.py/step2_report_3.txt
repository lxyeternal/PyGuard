  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code defines a set of custom exception classes for the `scrubadub` library.\n   - All classes are straightforward, inheriting from `Exception` or a custom base, with message formatting and attribute setting.\n   - No external data sources, sinks, or data flows involving untrusted input are present.\n   - No dynamic code execution, network calls, or file operations are evident.\n   - The only URL included is a static link to issue tracking, which is benign.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is standard exception handling, with no malicious behavior.\n   - They note the use of string formatting with controlled data, which is safe.\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are apparent.\n   - The reports' assessments are consistent and accurate.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n   - The confidence scores are 1, reflecting certainty about the benign assessment.\n   - These scores are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports or the code suggest any malicious activity, so risk scores higher than 0.5 are unwarranted.\n   - The code is purely structural, serving as exception classes.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - The malware score of 0 across all reports is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the code as standard exception handling.\n   - No suspicious or speculative claims are present.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable adjustments are needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear, straightforward class definitions.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks or vulnerabilities identified.\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes for the `scrubadub` library. The reports correctly identify the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. All scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis confirms that the code is safe and the reports are accurate.",
