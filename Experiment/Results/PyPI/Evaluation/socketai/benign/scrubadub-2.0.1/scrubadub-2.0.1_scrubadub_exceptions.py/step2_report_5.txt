  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, with no external data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The exception classes are straightforward, with messages and attributes set in constructors and string representations. No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports' Logic**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that this code is benign, standard exception handling code. They note the use of string formatting with controlled data, no external inputs, and no suspicious code patterns. There are no logical flaws or misconceptions in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - malware: 0\n   - obfuscated: 0\n   - securityRisk: 0  \n   These seem appropriate given the code's nature. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:  \n   Since all scores are zero, there's no need to justify higher scores. The code is safe.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the code's benign nature. No malicious activity is present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports are cautious and base their conclusions on the code's actual content, not assumptions. They recognize that the code is standard exception class definitions with no external dependencies or suspicious behaviors.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis: no malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n\n**Overall Assessment**:  \nThe code is a typical, safe implementation of custom exceptions for a Python library. The reports are accurate, thorough, and reasonable.\n\n**My Own Estimate**:  \n- **Malware score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated score**: 0  \n- **Risk score**: 0  \n\nThe code does not introduce any security risks or malicious behavior. It is a benign, standard exception handling setup.\n\n**Final notes**:  \nNo further action needed. The code is safe, and the reports correctly reflect that.",
