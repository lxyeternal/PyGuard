  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The provided code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for the `scrubadub` library.\n- The base class `ScrubadubException` sets an `issues_url` attribute and provides a `render()` method for message formatting.\n- Derived classes override `__str__()` to produce descriptive error messages.\n- The code uses string formatting with class attributes or internal variables, no external input, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious behavior, or malicious logic is present.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-step review:\n\n#### 1. **Are the reported issues present in the code?**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a set of exception class definitions.\n- No issues such as data leaks, external data handling, or malicious behavior are evident.\n- The code is straightforward and standard for exception handling.\n\n**Conclusion:** The issues claimed in the reports are accurate; no issues are falsely reported.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning:**\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and safe.\n- They correctly note that string formatting uses internal variables, with no external input.\n- No flawed reasoning or logical errors are evident in the analysis.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports' reasoning appears sound and well-founded.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n- All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`.\n- Given the code's nature, these scores are appropriate.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**Note:** The scores are consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n- All reports assign `securityRisk` and `malware` scores as 0.\n- This is appropriate; no risk warrants a higher score.\n- The code does not perform any actions that could be malicious or dangerous.\n\n**Conclusion:** No higher risk scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. **Malware score considerations:**\n- The code is purely class definitions for exceptions.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n- The `render()` method uses string formatting with controlled variables.\n\n**Conclusion:** Malware score should remain 0.\n\n---\n\n#### 6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n- All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n- No unwarranted assumptions about potential vulnerabilities are present.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessments are justified.\n\n---\n\n#### 7. **Consistency of scores with the report:**\n- The scores are consistent across reports.\n- All reports correctly rate the code as safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 (or similar low value, since it's standard exception code and no vulnerabilities)\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exceptions.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior detected.\n- The only minor point is the use of string formatting, but it is with internal variables only, so no security concern.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- The current scores are appropriate.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Score | Justification                                              |\n|-----------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0            | No malicious behavior detected                               |\n| Obfuscated      | 0            | Code is straightforward; no obfuscation evident             |\n| Security Risk   | 0.1          | Minimal risk, standard exception definitions; no vulnerabilities |\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, safe, and standard for exception handling in Python.**",
