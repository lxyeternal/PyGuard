{
  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions for the scrubadub data sanitization library, including base and specific error classes with messaging capabilities.",
  "sources": "No external data sources read; all data are class attributes or parameters passed during exception instantiation.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or cause data leaks; exceptions are for control flow and messaging only.",
  "flows": "Exception instantiations and string rendering are straightforward and do not involve untrusted input flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior detected. Exception messages include URLs for issue reporting.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for custom exceptions. The base exception 'ScrubadubException' sets a URL attribute and provides a message rendering method. Derived exceptions customize messaging or hold additional data. The use of string formatting and no dynamic code execution indicates standard, safe exception handling. No evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or data exfiltration exists.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical exception class setup for a Python library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be legitimate, safe code intended to provide meaningful error messages.",
