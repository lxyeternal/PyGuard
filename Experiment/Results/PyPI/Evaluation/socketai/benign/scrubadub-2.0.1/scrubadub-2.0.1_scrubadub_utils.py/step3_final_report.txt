  "purpose": "Utility functions for locale normalization, locale splitting, string set management, lookup indexing, and object string representation.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for locale functions, class attributes for string representations, internal data structures for lookup and string sets.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data sinks, network activity, or data exfiltration points present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into validation and normalization functions; class attributes are accessed for string representation; internal data structures manage identifiers without external communication.",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex for locale splitting is standard; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns; compatibility handling for Python 2/3 is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility classes and functions with input validation, normalization, and parsing. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of sensitive data. The regex and locale normalization are standard and safe. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign utility nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code for locale handling and string set management. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.",
