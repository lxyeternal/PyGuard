  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for SVG manipulation, including color conversion, coordinate splitting, XML formatting, and data encoding.",
  "sources": "Reads input strings for color values, coordinates, angles, and XML strings. Reads package data for font MIME types and URLs in text.",
  "sinks": "Returns formatted color strings, coordinate values, XML strings, base64-encoded data, and URLs extracted from text.",
  "flows": "Input strings for colors and coordinates are processed through regex matching and conversions, then used in return statements or data encoding functions.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears standard; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity detected. No obfuscation or malicious payloads evident.",
  "analysis": "The script offers utility functions for SVG handling and data encoding. The 'rgb' function converts RGB values to strings, with mode validation. 'iterflatlist' flattens nested iterables. 'strlist' joins values into a string. 'get_unit', 'split_coordinate', and 'split_angle' extract numeric and unit components from strings using regex. 'rect_top_left_corner' computes rectangle corners based on position and size, ensuring unit consistency. 'AutoID' generates incremental identifiers. 'pretty_xml' formats XML strings with indentation, using 'xml.dom.minidom'. 'font_mimetype' maps font file extensions to MIME types. 'base64_data' encodes data in base64 with specified MIME type. 'find_first_url' extracts URLs from CSS-like url() functions. No evidence of malicious intent, malicious code, or suspicious behavior found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of utility functions for SVG and XML processing, with no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It appears to be standard, well-structured support code without hidden malicious intent.",
