  "purpose": "Utility functions for SVG processing, color conversion, coordinate handling, XML formatting, and data encoding.",
  "sources": "Regex pattern matching for coordinates and angles, input parameters for functions, external pattern definitions.",
  "sinks": "None identified; functions do not process untrusted data in a way that leads to security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (coordinates, angles, strings) are processed through regex matching and formatting functions without external communication.",
  "anomalies": "Use of external regex patterns (pattern.coordinate, pattern.angle) without their definitions provided; no signs of obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward utility functions with clear purposes. No network activity, data exfiltration, or dynamic code execution. Regex patterns are assumed safe. The functions do not handle sensitive data or perform risky operations. The consistent malware score of 0 and low security risk score (~0.1) across reports are justified given the benign nature of the code. Minor concern is reliance on external regex patterns, but no evidence suggests they are malicious. The code is well-structured, with no obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility library for SVG and XML processing with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
