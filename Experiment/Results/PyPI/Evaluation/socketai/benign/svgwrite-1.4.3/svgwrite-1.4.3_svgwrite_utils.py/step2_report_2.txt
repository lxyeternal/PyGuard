  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious code, obfuscation, and security risks, and ensure the scores align with the content.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states the code is utility functions for SVG manipulation, color processing, coordinate handling, and XML formatting. It finds no suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or obfuscation. The malware score is 0, and confidence is high (0.95).\n\n- **Assessment:** The functions are straightforward, with no external network calls or data leaks. The reliance on external regex patterns for coordinate and angle matching is noted but not suspicious if patterns are safe.\n\n- **Score justification:** The malware score of 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity detected. Obfuscated score is 0, which matches the clear code.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar utility functions for SVG, including color conversion, list flattening, coordinate splitting, XML formatting, base64 encoding, and URL extraction. No malicious behaviors or obfuscation are detected; the malware score is 0, with a security risk of 0.1.\n\n- **Assessment:** The functions are standard, with no signs of malicious intent. The only minor concern is the URL extraction via regex, but it's used for data parsing only.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware score of 0 is justified. Security risk is low but not zero, given the URL extraction, which is acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above—utility functions for SVG, color, coordinates, XML, data encoding, with no malicious activity. Malware score is 0, confidence high.\n\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious behaviors. The code is standard and safe.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware score remains appropriate at 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for SVG, coordinate parsing, XML, font MIME types, base64, URL extraction. No malicious activity or obfuscation, malware score 0, security risk 0.1.\n\n- **Assessment:** The functions are typical for such utilities. The regex for URL extraction is standard.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware score is correctly 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar utility functions with no suspicious behaviors. Malware score 0, confidence 0.95.\n\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious code or obfuscation.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the code being benign utility functions.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low, mostly 0.1, which is reasonable given the functions' nature.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should stay at 0.\n- **Risk score:** Given the code is purely utility functions with no external communication or malicious payloads, a risk score of around 0.1 is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, due to pattern matching and URL extraction, but these are standard practices)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
