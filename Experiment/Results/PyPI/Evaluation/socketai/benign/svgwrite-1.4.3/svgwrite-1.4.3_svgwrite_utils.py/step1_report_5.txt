{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for SVG manipulation, including color conversion, coordinate parsing, XML formatting, and data encoding.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from parameters such as color values, coordinates, angles, and XML strings. Uses external libraries (svgwrite.data.pattern, re, base64, xml.dom.minidom).",
  "sinks": "Returns formatted strings (e.g., rgb colors, XML, base64 data URIs). Uses regex to extract URLs from text.",
  "flows": "Input parameters like color values or coordinates are processed through functions like rgb(), split_coordinate(), get_unit(), etc., to produce output strings or parsed data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns. The code performs standard data manipulation and formatting. Uses regex in find_first_url but only to extract URLs, which is typical. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors detected. No dynamic code execution, network connections, or data exfiltration routines.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for SVG and XML processing, including color formatting, list flattening, string joining, coordinate parsing, rectangle corner calculation, XML pretty printing, font MIME type retrieval, base64 encoding, and URL extraction. No suspicious or malicious code elements are present; all functions perform standard, expected operations. No external network activity, data leakage, or backdoors are evident. Functions are well-structured and adhere to typical data handling practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign set of utility functions for SVG and XML processing, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It operates solely on provided input data and returns formatted or parsed results without side effects.",
