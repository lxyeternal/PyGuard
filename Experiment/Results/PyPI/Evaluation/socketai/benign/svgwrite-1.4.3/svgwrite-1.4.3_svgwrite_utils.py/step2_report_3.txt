  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the evidence provided and the potential for malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for SVG, color, coordinate, and XML processing. No suspicious behaviors or external network activity. High confidence (0.95). Malware score: 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** The functions are standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. Regex patterns are external but likely safe. No issues detected.\n\n- **Score adjustments:** The malware score of 0 aligns with the analysis. Security risk is also 0, which seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar utility functions with focus on SVG, encoding, and data extraction. No malicious behaviors, no obfuscation. Slightly lower confidence (0.9). Malware score: 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** The functions are standard, with no suspicious external calls or code. The only minor concern is the URL extraction via regex, but it's a benign data extraction.\n\n- **Score adjustments:** Malware score remains 0, consistent with the report.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for SVG, color, coordinate, XML, with no malicious activity. High confidence (0.9). Malware score: 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; functions are straightforward, no malicious behaviors.\n\n- **Score adjustments:** Malware remains 0, security risk is low (0.1), which is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar utility functions, pattern matching for coordinates and angles, no malicious activity. High confidence (0.9). Malware score: 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** No signs of obfuscation or malicious code. Pattern matching relies on external regex patterns, but these are assumed safe.\n\n- **Score adjustments:** Malware remains 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for SVG and XML processing, no suspicious behaviors. Very high confidence (0.95). Malware score: 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** Functions are standard, no malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Score adjustments:** Malware remains 0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the analysis. No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated payloads.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward, well-structured code.\n\n- **Risk score:** Very low (0.1 or 0), reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware risk:** The code is composed of utility functions that are standard in SVG/XML processing. No network activity, code injection, or malicious payloads are present.\n\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is clear, with no signs of obfuscation or dynamic code execution.\n\n- **Overall risk:** The code is safe, with no indicators of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities beyond minor concerns about pattern matching assumptions, which are standard.\n\n---\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThese reflect the comprehensive review and the absence of any malicious or suspicious activity in the provided code.",
