{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for SVG manipulation, color conversion, coordinate processing, XML formatting, and data encoding.",
  "sources": "Imports external modules: base64, Path from pathlib, pattern from svgwrite.data, minidom from xml.dom.minidom, re for regex operations.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that handle untrusted data or perform actions with untrusted input. Functions mainly process data locally or format strings.",
  "flows": "Input data from function parameters is processed internally; no external network, file, or system command execution observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. Use of regex matching for coordinates and angles relies on pattern matching; no obfuscation or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions related to SVG processing, including color formatting, flattening lists, splitting coordinates and angles, computing rectangle corners, generating incremental IDs, pretty-printing XML, and encoding data as base64. All functions perform standard operations with no apparent malicious intent. No dangerous external calls, data leaks, or security flaws are evident. The only potential concern might be the 'find_first_url' function, which extracts URLs using regex, but it is used purely for data extraction without side effects. Overall, the code is straightforward, well-structured, and performs safe operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a collection of SVG utility functions with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears to be a standard helper library for SVG and XML data manipulation, with no external data exfiltration or harmful actions. The malware and security risk scores are very low.",
