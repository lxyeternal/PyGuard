  "purpose": "Utility functions and classes for SVG manipulation, color processing, coordinate handling, and XML formatting.",
  "sources": "Standard library imports (base64, Path, re, xml.dom.minidom), svgwrite.data.pattern for pattern matching.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly identified; no direct data leaks, external network calls, or sensitive data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks that could cause harm; functions process data internally without external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code appears standard and well-structured, focused on data formatting and processing.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for SVG color formatting, list flattening, string joining, coordinate parsing, and XML pretty-printing. It uses pattern matching to parse coordinate and angle strings, relying on external regex patterns. The functions are straightforward, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. No network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection mechanisms are present. The use of standard libraries and typical utility functions suggests benign intent. The only potential concern is the reliance on external patterns for coordinate and angle matching, but these are likely well-defined and safe. Overall, the code appears to serve legitimate purposes without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions for SVG and XML processing with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It is well-structured, with no suspicious or harmful code elements detected.",
