  "purpose": "Utility functions for SVG handling, color conversion, coordinate manipulation, XML formatting, and data encoding.",
  "sources": "Pattern matching in get_unit, split_coordinate, split_angle; input parameters to functions; external modules like re, base64, pathlib, xml.dom.minidom.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, as functions primarily process data and return strings or tuples; no direct data leaks or untrusted data handling beyond pattern matching.",
  "flows": "Pattern matching results from get_unit, split_coordinate, split_angle are used to parse and process coordinate and angle strings; find_first_url uses regex to extract URLs from text.",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex pattern matching for coordinates and angles assumes pattern.coordinate and pattern.angle are well-defined; no visible code for these patterns in the snippet. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors found. The code is mostly utility functions with no direct network or system modification actions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides various utility functions for color conversion, list flattening, string joining, coordinate and angle parsing, rectangle corner calculation, XML pretty-printing, font MIME type lookup, base64 encoding, and URL extraction. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors, no external data transfers, no dynamic code execution, and no sensitive information handling. Pattern matching relies on pre-defined regex patterns (assumed safe). The functions operate on inputs and produce formatted outputs, with validation and error handling in place. No signs of obfuscation or malware code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of harmless utility functions intended for SVG and XML processing with no malicious intent, no suspicious network activity, and no security risks evident from the code itself.",
