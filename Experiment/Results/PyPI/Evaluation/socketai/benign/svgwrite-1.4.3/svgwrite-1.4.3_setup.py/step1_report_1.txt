{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for the 'svgwrite' Python package, intended to prepare the package for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads text from 'version.py' within the 'svgwrite' directory, 'README.rst', and 'NEWS.rst' files.",
  "sinks": "The code executes the version string extraction and reads external files; no sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive actions are present.",
  "flows": "The version string is extracted from 'version.py' through reading and executing a line, then used in the setup configuration; file contents are read for long description.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec' to run code from 'version.py' could be risky if the file is maliciously altered, but in this context, it's used solely for extracting a version string. No other anomalies are present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks, including reading version info and package metadata. The only potentially unusual element is the use of 'exec' to execute a line from 'version.py', which is a common but slightly unsafe pattern for extracting version information. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code does not process untrusted input or perform any network operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a typical setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent. The only minor concern is the use of 'exec' for version extraction, which is common practice but could be slightly safer with alternative parsing methods. Overall, the code appears safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
