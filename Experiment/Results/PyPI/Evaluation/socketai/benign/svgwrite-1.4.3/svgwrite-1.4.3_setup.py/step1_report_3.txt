{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the svgwrite Python package, used to configure package metadata and installation details.",
  "sources": "Reading the content of 'svgwrite/version.py' for version info, reading 'README.rst' and 'NEWS.rst' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating potential data leakage or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "Reading version information from 'version.py' and long description files; no data flows leading to unsafe operations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to execute a line from 'version.py' to extract __version__, which is a potential security concern if the file contents are compromised. Otherwise, the rest is standard setup code.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily reads static files for version and description data, and uses exec() to evaluate a line defining __version__. Since the files are local and controlled, this is generally safe but could be risky if files are tampered with. The code employs standard packaging practices with no network activity, no hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior. The use of exec() for version extraction is a mild concern but acceptable in this context given the controlled environment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with minimal risk. The only noteworthy point is the use of exec() to parse the version, which is a common but slightly risky practice. No malware or malicious behavior detected.",
