{
  "purpose": "Standard setup script for the 'svgwrite' Python library, primarily to extract version info and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from 'version.py' via executing a line with 'exec()'; reads static files 'README.rst' and 'NEWS.rst' for descriptions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or environment variable manipulations; only executes a line from 'version.py'.",
  "flows": "Reads lines from 'version.py', executes a line to set '__version__', then proceeds with package setup.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec()' to evaluate a line for '__version__' extraction, which could be risky if 'version.py' is compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with minimal security concerns. The main point of caution is the use of 'exec()' to parse version info, which is common but could be unsafe if the source file is malicious. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. Files read are static and controlled. The script does not process untrusted input or perform network operations. The malware score is justified as 0, and the low security risk score (~0.1) reflects the minor concern over 'exec()'. The code is clear and straightforward, with no obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, safe setup configuration with negligible security risks. The only minor concern is the use of 'exec()' for version extraction, which is acceptable in controlled environments. No malicious activity or malicious intent is evident.",
