  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'svgwrite' Python library, used to package and distribute the library.",
  "sources": "Reads the version from 'svgwrite/version.py', reads text from 'README.rst' and 'NEWS.rst' files.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; setup configuration data is static or from trusted files.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from a local file, then passes static metadata to 'setup()' function; reads long description files.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'exec()' to execute the content of 'version.py' to extract '__version__', which can be risky if the file is malicious or tampered with.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python package setup script. It reads version information by executing code from 'version.py', which could be a vector for code injection if that file is malicious. Other file reads are static and standard for setup scripts. No network or malicious code behavior is present. The use of 'exec()' is a potential concern, but common in setup scripts for dynamic version extraction. Overall, the code appears typical for a package setup and does not contain malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with a minor risk associated with executing external version code via 'exec()'. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or malware, but the use of 'exec()' warrants caution if 'version.py' is tampered with. Overall security risk is low.",
