{
  "purpose": "Define and manage SVG drawing objects, including rendering and saving SVG files with optional stylesheets.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are primarily parameters for methods, such as 'href', 'filename', and SVG attributes. No external data inputs or untrusted sources are read within the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include writing SVG XML content to files or file-like objects, and embedding stylesheet references. No direct use of untrusted data leads to harmful actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method parameters (e.g., 'href', 'filename') into internal attributes and then into output files via 'write' and 'save' functions. No untrusted data is used in security-sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward, with no obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious logic. No backdoors or hidden malicious behavior detected. No unusual code patterns or functions are present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements an SVG drawing class with methods to generate XML, add stylesheets, and save files. It handles file output safely with encoding specified, and the stylesheet links are stored as tuples without processing or network operations. There are no external data sources, no dynamic code execution, or unsafe practices observed. The code relies on standard library modules and does not contain any suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for generating and saving SVG files with optional stylesheets. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected. It appears safe and legitimate for its intended purpose.",
