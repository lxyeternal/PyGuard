{
  "purpose": "The code defines an SVG drawing class for creating, managing, and saving SVG files with support for stylesheets and XML formatting.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration parameters during initialization; reads stylesheet links via add_stylesheet method; reads filename in save/saveas methods.",
  "sinks": "Writes XML output to files via write, save, saveas methods; writes stylesheet links into output; outputs SVG XML string.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (filename, stylesheets) flow into internal state; internal state flows into XML output; stylesheet links flow into the output file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual dynamic code execution. No use of eval, exec, or network activity. Code appears standard for SVG handling.",
  "analysis": "The code implements an SVG drawing container with methods for adding stylesheets, generating XML, and saving files. No external input is processed in a malicious way. No obfuscated or suspicious constructs are present. The class handles file I/O safely with encoding specified. It relies on external svgwrite library components, which are standard. No hidden backdoors or malicious data leaks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate SVG drawing utility with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It simply manages SVG content, stylesheets, and file output in a standard manner.",
