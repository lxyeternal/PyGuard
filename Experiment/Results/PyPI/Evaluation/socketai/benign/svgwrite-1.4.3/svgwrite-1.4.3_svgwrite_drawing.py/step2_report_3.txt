  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the described issues, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward SVG management utility, involving file I/O, XML generation, stylesheet handling, and saving.  \n- No network activity, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution is present.  \n- The code relies on external libraries (`svgwrite`) but uses standard practices.  \n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious patterns are detected.  \n- The reported issues consistently indicate benign, standard behavior with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Specific analysis per report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & flow:** Correctly describes the code's purpose.  \n- **Anomalies & analysis:** No suspicious or malicious code patterns.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0, security risk 0.2 (low), confidence 1.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, with consistent reasoning.  \n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0, confidence 1.  \n- **Verdict:** Valid.\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Same conclusions, with detailed reasoning.  \n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0.1, confidence 0.9.  \n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Same assessment: benign code, standard SVG handling.  \n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0, confidence 1.  \n- **Verdict:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Consistent with previous analyses, no suspicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0, confidence 1.  \n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior.  \n- **Obfuscated scores:** All 0, which is accurate.  \n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero in some reports (up to 0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risk of file I/O and XML generation, which is acceptable.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Risk score:** **0.1 - 0.2** — minimal risk associated with file handling, which is typical for such utilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Estimated Score |\n|------------------|------------------------|\n| Malware          | **0**                |\n| Obfuscated       | **0**                |\n| Security Risk    | **0.1** to **0.2**   |\n\nThe reports' scores are consistent with the code's nature. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nThis code is a standard SVG utility with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low security risk reflects typical file I/O operations, which are common in such utilities.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**The code is safe, non-malicious, and well within expected security parameters for its functionality.**",
