{
  "purpose": "Define an SVG drawing class with methods for creating, modifying, and saving SVG files, including stylesheets and XML output.",
  "sources": "File input/output operations (save, saveas, write), adding stylesheets, get_xml method.",
  "sinks": "File write operations, string conversions for output, appending stylesheets.",
  "flows": "Data from internal attributes and method parameters flows into file output and XML serialization; no untrusted data flow evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors. No obfuscation or hidden code detected. Use of standard libraries and straightforward code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for SVG drawing management with methods for generating XML, adding stylesheets, and saving files. It employs standard Python practices, uses well-known libraries (`io`, `svgwrite`), and contains no indications of malicious activity. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious network operations are present. The class handles file I/O and XML serialization safely, with no evidence of data leakage or malicious side-effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of an SVG drawing utility. It appears to be a legitimate library component without malicious intent or security risks.",
