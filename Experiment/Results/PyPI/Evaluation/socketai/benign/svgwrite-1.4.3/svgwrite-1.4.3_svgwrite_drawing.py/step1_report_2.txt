{
  "purpose": "Define an SVG drawing class with methods to generate, modify, and save SVG content, including stylesheets management.",
  "sources": "Reads from imported modules, class attributes, method parameters (filename, href, title, media, etc.), and internal data structures like self._stylesheets.",
  "sinks": "File operations (writing to files), string generation for XML content, appending stylesheets, and output to file-like objects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from inputs (method parameters, class attributes) to sinks such as file writes, string outputs, and stylesheet references; no untrusted input processing or external network communication detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or backdoors. No unusual or malicious operations found. The code strictly handles SVG content generation and file I/O.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of an SVG drawing class, utilizing common Python modules and adhering to typical file handling and XML generation practices. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The methods focus on generating SVG XML, managing stylesheets, and saving output files. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign SVG drawing utility module. It performs standard operations related to SVG content creation, styling, and file output without any malicious intent or security risks.",
