  "purpose": "Define a factory for creating various SVG elements using the svgwrite library.",
  "sources": "Imports from svgwrite library, access to 'factoryelements' dictionary, class instantiation and attribute access.",
  "sinks": "Potentially dynamically invoked element creation via ElementFactory, but no direct sinks for untrusted data present.",
  "flows": "Attribute access in ElementFactory to get element builders, which then instantiate SVG element objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The code primarily provides a wrapper for SVG element creation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple modules from svgwrite and defines a dictionary mapping SVG tags to classes. ElementBuilder wraps class instantiation, injecting the factory context. ElementFactory dynamically returns ElementBuilder instances for valid SVG tags. There are no input/output operations, network calls, or data manipulations that could be malicious. No code injection, data leakage, or secret access mechanisms are present. The code appears purely structural, facilitating SVG element creation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward factory pattern implementation for SVG element creation using svgwrite. It contains no malicious behavior, no data leakage, and no suspicious activities. It’s safe from a security perspective.",
