  "purpose": "Define a factory for creating SVG drawing elements using the svgwrite library.",
  "sources": "Imports from svgwrite library; no input or external data reading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external effects; object creation is straightforward.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; code is standard factory pattern implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various modules from svgwrite and maps SVG element tags to corresponding classes. It defines an ElementBuilder to instantiate these classes, and an ElementFactory to access them dynamically. There are no input parsing, no external data sources, nor any code that executes untrusted data. The code strictly creates SVG elements and does not perform any network, file, or environment interactions. No obfuscated code, no suspicious constructs, and no malicious intent observed.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard factory pattern implementation for SVG element creation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
