  "purpose": "Defines a factory for creating SVG elements using the svgwrite library, facilitating dynamic SVG element generation.",
  "sources": "Imports from the svgwrite library; no external or untrusted input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks; code merely maps element names to classes and creates instances.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are detected. The code is straightforward and uses standard library functions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports SVG element classes from the svgwrite package, defines a dictionary for mapping SVG tag names to their corresponding classes, and creates factory classes for instantiating these elements dynamically. The ElementBuilder class injects the factory into element instances, and ElementFactory provides dynamic attribute access to generate element builders. There is no user input processing, network operations, or file handling that could be exploited maliciously. No obfuscated code or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a simple factory pattern implementation for SVG element creation using svgwrite. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The implementation is standard and safe.",
