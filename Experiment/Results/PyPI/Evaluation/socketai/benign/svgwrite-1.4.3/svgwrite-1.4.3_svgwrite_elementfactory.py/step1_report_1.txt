  "purpose": "Define a factory for creating SVG elements using the svgwrite library.",
  "sources": "Imports from svgwrite library; no external input or data sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed; no output or data leak points.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code mainly sets up class mappings and factory methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors; no obfuscation, malicious code, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various components from the svgwrite library to create SVG elements. It defines a dictionary mapping element tags to svgwrite classes, then creates ElementBuilder for instantiation. The ElementFactory class dynamically returns ElementBuilder instances for valid element names. The code functions as a factory pattern without executing or processing untrusted data. No signs of malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or malicious code segments. The structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of a factory pattern for SVG element creation using svgwrite. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, and appears safe for use. It simply maps SVG element tags to their classes and provides a way to instantiate them dynamically.",
