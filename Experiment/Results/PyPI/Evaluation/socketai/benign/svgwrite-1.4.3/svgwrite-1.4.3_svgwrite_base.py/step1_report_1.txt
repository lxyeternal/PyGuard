  "purpose": "Define a base class for SVG elements and associated helper classes for SVG structure manipulation.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters, particularly in methods like update(), set_metadata(), and constructors like Title, Desc, Metadata.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to self.attribs, appending child elements in self.elements, XML serialization via etree.tostring().",
  "flows": "Input data from update() and constructors flows into attribs and elements, which are then serialized or used for further SVG/XML processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns are present. Use of copy module is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes an SVG element hierarchy with attributes and subelements, provides mechanisms for updating attributes, copying objects, generating XML representations, and setting metadata. It includes validation hooks that are conditional on debug mode, which is typical for development tools. No network operations, data leaks, or malicious behavior are evident. The code structure is straightforward and does not contain suspicious logic or hidden backdoors. No obfuscated code features are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard SVG element management class with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be legitimate, open-source SVG handling code with typical features and no suspicious behaviors.",
