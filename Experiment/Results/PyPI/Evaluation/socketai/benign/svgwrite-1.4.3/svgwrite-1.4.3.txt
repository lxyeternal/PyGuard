The only minor concern is the embedding of external resources via 'href', which is standard in SVGs but should be sanitized if user input is involved. Overall, the code is safe and well-structured."

The low security risk score appropriately reflects the potential for SVG injection if used with untrusted data, but this is a common and external concern, not a flaw in the code itself."
