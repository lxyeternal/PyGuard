{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Python library for creating SVG drawings, including units and basic functionality.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the imported modules (.version, svgwrite.drawing, svgwrite.utils) and its own class instantiation.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that handle untrusted data or external system commands are present.",
  "flows": "No evident source-to-sink data flow involving untrusted input; the code mainly defines classes and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code segments observed. No obfuscated code or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily includes class definitions, constants, and import statements for a library aimed at SVG generation. No user input handling, network activity, or system modifications are present. The import of version info and utility functions is standard. The class 'Unit' provides unit string formatting, which is a benign utility. The code appears to be a normal library setup without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward library setup for SVG drawing utilities, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and standard in structure.",
