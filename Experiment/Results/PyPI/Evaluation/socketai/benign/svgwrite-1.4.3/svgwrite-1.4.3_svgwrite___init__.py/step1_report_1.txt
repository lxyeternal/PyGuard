  "purpose": "Define a Python library for creating SVG graphics with unit handling and metadata.",
  "sources": "Imports from .version, svgwrite.drawing, and svgwrite.utils; usage of class and function definitions.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data outputs or network connections.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external input to critical sinks; code mainly defines classes and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; straightforward class and function definitions, no obfuscation or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard library module that provides unit conversions and metadata for an SVG drawing library. It imports version info and other modules, defines a Unit class for appending units to numeric values, and creates several predefined units. There are no signs of malicious code such as network operations, data exfiltration, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation. The purpose appears to be purely to facilitate SVG creation, with no suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign library component with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It mainly provides utility classes and constants related to SVG graphics.",
