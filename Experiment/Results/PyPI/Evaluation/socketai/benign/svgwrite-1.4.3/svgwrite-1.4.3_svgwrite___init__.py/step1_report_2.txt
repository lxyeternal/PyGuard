{
  "purpose": "Defines a Python library for creating SVG drawings with support for units and metadata.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.version, svgwrite.drawing, svgwrite.utils), no external input sources observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or sensitive operations; no network, file, or system commands executed.",
  "flows": "No identifiable data flow from sources to sinks; code mainly defines classes and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code is straightforward and typical for a library setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports local and third-party modules, defines a Unit class for adding units to values, and sets up common unit instances. No network activity, no command execution, no handling of untrusted data or input. The purpose appears to be establishing constants and helper functions for SVG drawing creation. No obfuscation, suspicious functions, or malicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard library setup for SVG drawing utilities, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It is a benign component meant for use as part of a larger project.",
