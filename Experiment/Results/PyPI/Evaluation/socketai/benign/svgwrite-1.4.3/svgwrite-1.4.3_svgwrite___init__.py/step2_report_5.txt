  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward library module defining units and metadata for SVG creation.\n- No external or untrusted input handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution is observed.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscation.\n- The code is primarily class definitions, constants, and import statements.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence:** The code matches the described purpose: utility classes for units, version info, author metadata, and no suspicious logic.\n- **Malicious code:** None detected—no network calls, no file writes, no dynamic execution, no obfuscated parts.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None apparent; the code is a benign setup module.\n\n---\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:\n- The code is straightforward; no logical errors or flaws are evident.\n- The only minor note is that the `Unit` class's `__rmul__` method returns a string, which is fine but could be clarified in documentation. However, this isn't a security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0; code is clear and un-obfuscated.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0; no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors.\n\n**Any adjustments?**  \nNo, the scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The code is purely utility and metadata; no reason to suspect hidden malicious intent.\n- The import of version info and units is standard for a library.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on the provided code and reports, I concur with their conclusions.**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign, standard utility module for SVG creation, with no security risks or malicious behavior detected.",
