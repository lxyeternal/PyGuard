  "purpose": "Define a Python library for creating SVG graphics with utility functions and version info.",
  "sources": "Import statements for version info, SVG drawing classes, and utility functions; class definitions for Unit and units instantiation.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or external communication; no database, network, or file write operations present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as there are no data flow paths involving untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious logic; code consists of straightforward class and function definitions, constants, and documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides documentation, version info, author info, and a Unit class with methods to append units to values. It defines various units as instances of the class for convenient use. No input/output operations, network calls, or dynamic execution are present. There are no hardcoded credentials or malicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign library setup for SVG creation and unit handling. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are identified.",
