  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward library module defining units and metadata for SVG creation.\n- No network activity, user input handling, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are detected.\n- The code is primarily composed of class definitions, constants, and import statements.\n\n**Confirming issues:**\n- The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious or insecure.\n- The purpose is purely utility and metadata setup for an SVG drawing library.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n- No logical errors or security flaws are apparent.\n- The code is well-structured, with clear documentation and standard patterns.\n- The only minor note is that the `Unit` class's `__call__` method returns a comma-separated string, which might be less useful if the user expects a list or other format, but this is not a security concern.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n- These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, which is reasonable.\n\n**Justification for risk scores:**\n- Since no malicious activity or vulnerabilities are detected, the risk scores should remain at 0.\n- The malware score is correctly 0; no malicious intent or behavior is present.\n- The obfuscated score is correctly 0; the code is straightforward and readable.\n- The overall security risk is correctly 0.\n\n**Potential discrepancies or overestimations:**\n- None detected; the assessments are consistent with the code.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a benign utility module for SVG drawing, with no security issues.\n- I agree with the provided reports' conclusions and scores.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThis code is a standard, well-structured library component with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
