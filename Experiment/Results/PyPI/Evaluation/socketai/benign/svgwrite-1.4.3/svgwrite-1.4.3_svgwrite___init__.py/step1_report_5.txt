  "purpose": "This code defines a Python library for creating SVG drawings, including utility functions and classes for units and measurements.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.version, svgwrite.drawing, svgwrite.utils); no external or user input sources identified.",
  "sinks": "None; no outputs or data flows to external systems, networks, or files other than library functionality.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks, no network or external system interactions observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. The code appears to be standard library setup with class definitions and constants.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily contains metadata comments, module imports, class definitions for units, and constants for measurement units. It does not include code that processes untrusted input, performs network activity, or manipulates sensitive data. All imports are standard and local, with no external calls or dynamic code execution. No potential malicious behaviors or anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign library definition for SVG drawing utilities. It does not contain any malicious code, suspicious behaviors, or security risks based on the provided content.",
