  "purpose": "A Python library module providing units and metadata for SVG drawing creation, including a Unit class for appending measurement units to values and predefined unit instances.",
  "sources": "Imports version info, SVG drawing classes, and utility functions; defines metadata and a Unit class with unit instances.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no network or file I/O beyond documentation example.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; code primarily defines classes and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility module for SVG creation, defining measurement units and metadata. It contains no network activity, user input handling, or dynamic code execution. The class and constants are clear and well-structured. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk code is present. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, utility-focused module with no malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly assess the absence of malware, obfuscation, and security risks. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
