  "purpose": "Define classes for SVG gradient elements (linear and radial) and their associated properties and methods.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for class constructors, method arguments such as 'inherit', 'offset', 'color', 'opacity', 'start', 'end', 'center', 'r', 'focal'.",
  "sinks": "Methods that modify object attributes like 'self[...]' and 'add' functions which set SVG element attributes or add child elements.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> class initializers -> setting attributes via 'self[...]' -> methods like 'add_stop_color', 'add_colors', which modify internal SVG element structure.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious external network calls, or backdoors detected. The code appears to be a straightforward SVG gradient class definition. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines SVG gradient classes, including stops and gradient types, with methods for adding color stops and inheriting properties. No external data input sources such as network calls, file reads, or environment variables are present. No malicious code patterns, code injections, or suspicious behaviors are identified. The methods strictly manipulate internal object attributes related to SVG structure. The class design aligns with standard SVG handling libraries. The code appears to be purely for creating SVG gradient elements and does not perform any external operations or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a module for SVG gradient creation and manipulation, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It is a standard implementation without any suspicious or malicious patterns.",
