  "purpose": "Defines classes for creating SVG gradient elements (linear and radial) with methods for adding stops and generating XML.",
  "sources": "Input data includes parameters for gradient stops, inherit references, color arrays, and start/end points for gradients.",
  "sinks": "Generated XML elements and attributes; no direct sinks for untrusted data in this code.",
  "flows": "User-provided parameters flow into class constructors and methods like add_stop_color and add_colors, resulting in XML attribute assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution. The code is standard for SVG gradient generation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for SVG gradient objects with methods to add color stops and generate XML. It processes user inputs for attributes like colors, positions, and inheritance references. No data leaks, network operations, or system modifications are present. The code relies on external svgwrite library components but does not perform any malicious actions or contain malicious logic. No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a straightforward implementation of SVG gradient classes, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It is safe and does not contain malware or obfuscated code.",
