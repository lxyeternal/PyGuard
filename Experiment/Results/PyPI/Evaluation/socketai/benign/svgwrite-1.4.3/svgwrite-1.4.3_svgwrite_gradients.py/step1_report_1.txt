{
  "purpose": "Define classes for SVG gradient elements, including linear and radial gradients, with methods for setting properties and adding stops.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads input data or untrusted sources directly. External dependencies are imported but not used for input handling.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data that could lead to leaks or effects; code mainly constructs SVG elements.",
  "flows": "Not applicable as there are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted data; methods manipulate object properties internally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The code is straightforward class definitions for SVG elements.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for SVG gradient elements with methods for setting gradient stops, colors, and properties. It imports external modules but does not process user input or perform external communications. No signs of malicious behavior, hidden code, or security issues are evident. The structure and purpose align with standard SVG gradient handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of SVG gradient classes for use in SVG generation libraries. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. Overall, the code is safe with a very low malware risk.",
