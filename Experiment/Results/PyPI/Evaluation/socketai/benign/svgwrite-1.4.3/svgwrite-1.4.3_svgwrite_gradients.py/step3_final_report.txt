  "purpose": "Defines classes for SVG gradient elements (linear and radial) with methods to add stops and generate XML, intended for SVG image creation.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters for gradient properties, method calls for adding stops and colors.",
  "sinks": "Generated SVG XML output; no external data input or network communication.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into class attributes and methods, resulting in SVG XML generation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of SVG gradient classes, with methods for setting properties and adding color stops. It does not process external untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain obfuscated code. The logic is clear, and the purpose is solely to generate SVG gradient elements. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security flaws are present. The code's benign nature is confirmed by multiple reports, all assigning a malware score of 0 and very low security risk scores (~0.1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured SVG gradient utility with no malicious or obfuscated elements. It poses no security threat and is safe for use in SVG generation contexts.",
