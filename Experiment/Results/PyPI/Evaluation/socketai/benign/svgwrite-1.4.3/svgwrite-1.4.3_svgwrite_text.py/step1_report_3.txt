  "purpose": "Define classes for handling SVG text elements such as text, tspan, tref, textPath, and textArea for rendering SVG documents.",
  "sources": "Imports from svgwrite.base, svgwrite.mixins, and svgwrite.utils; class constructors and methods accessing input parameters and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data sources are parameters such as 'text', 'insert', 'x', 'y', 'dx', 'dy', 'rotate', 'path', 'startOffset', and 'size' that are used to generate XML attributes or element content.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., 'text', 'path', coordinate values) flows into class initializations and attribute assignments; these are then rendered into XML via get_xml methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code constructs detected. The code performs standard SVG element handling with no signs of obfuscation or hidden malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines various classes for SVG text elements, handling user input parameters with validation and conversion to XML attributes. It uses safe string conversions, standard list processing, and no unsafe dynamic execution or external network activity. No suspicious or malicious patterns such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are present. The code appears to be a well-structured SVG utility module with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard SVG text element handling library with no evident malicious behavior or security risks. It processes input parameters safely and converts them into XML elements for SVG rendering. No malware signals or security threats are identified.",
