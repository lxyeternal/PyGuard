  "purpose": "Defines classes for SVG text elements, including text spans, references, paths, and text areas, facilitating SVG document creation and manipulation.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for class constructors (e.g., text content, insert positions, coordinate lists, references).",
  "sinks": "XML serialization via get_xml() methods, which generate SVG XML elements with embedded text and attributes.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed and assigned to element attributes; get_xml() converts internal state into XML text.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. No external network or file system operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines SVG text-related classes with standard parameter handling, safe attribute setting, and XML output. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The only potential security concern is SVG injection if untrusted input is embedded into SVGs, which is a common consideration for SVG content generation but not an inherent flaw. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and uses standard practices. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the risk score is low (~0.1-0.2) to account for potential SVG injection vectors in insecure contexts. Confidence is high (around 0.9).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured SVG text manipulation library with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The low security risk score appropriately reflects the potential for SVG injection if used with untrusted data, but this is a common and external concern, not a flaw in the code itself.",
