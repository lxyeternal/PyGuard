  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical consistency, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states that the code is a straightforward SVG text manipulation library, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** The code does not contain any signs of malware or obfuscation. The low security risk score (0.2) is reasonable, given that the code processes untrusted input into SVG XML, which could theoretically lead to SVG injection if embedded in a web context. The confidence level is high.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores seem appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is standard SVG text handling with no malicious or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** The absence of malware and obfuscation is clear. The security risk is minimal, as no external network or file operations are performed.\n- **Conclusion:** The assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is described as standard SVG text classes with safe handling of input parameters, no malicious code, or external activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** The code appears safe; the risk score of 0 is justified.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores are consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing safe parameter handling and no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** The slight increase in risk score (0.2) accounts for potential SVG injection if untrusted data is embedded in SVG. This is a standard concern with SVG content, but not indicative of malicious intent by the code itself.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores are justified and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a typical SVG text class implementation with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** The minimal risk score reflects the potential SVG injection vector when embedding untrusted data, but no actual malicious activity is present.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variations (0.1 to 0.2) are reasonable, reflecting the potential SVG injection risk when untrusted input is embedded into SVG XML. Given the code's nature, these are appropriate.\n- **Confidence levels:** High (mostly 1 or 0.9), matching the clarity and safety of the code.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a standard SVG text handling library, with no malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The minor security risk scores are justified by the potential for SVG injection if user input is not sanitized before embedding into SVG documents, which is a common concern with SVG content.\n- No changes to scores are necessary; they are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (aligned with the reports)  \n- **Confidence:** High (around 0.9)\n\n**Final note:** The code appears safe and well-structured, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
