  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its behavior, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is utility mixins for SVG attribute management, with no signs of malicious activity. The report correctly notes that the code performs straightforward attribute setting, with no external code execution or data leaks.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n\n- **Assessment:** The low risk score (0.1) is reasonable, given the code's benign nature. The malware score is appropriately zero, as no malicious behavior is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it emphasizes the benign nature of the code, noting straightforward attribute handling and no malicious patterns.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score (0.2) might be due to cautiousness, but given the code's utility nature, this is still reasonable. Malware remains zero.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code again appears as a standard SVG attribute utility, with no malicious activity. The focus is on attribute setting, with no external calls or suspicious logic.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n\n- **Assessment:** Zero risk and malware scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Consistent with previous assessments, no malicious behavior or obfuscation detected. The code is straightforward.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Also aligns with prior findings—standard attribute management with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n\n- **Assessment:** Correct and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious actions, network activity, or code execution.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate. The code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 or 0.2) in the first two reports, but overall, the code is safe. The higher scores seem to reflect cautiousness rather than actual risk.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is purely utility functions for SVG attribute handling.\n- No external code execution, network activity, or data leaks.\n- No obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** **0** (no security risk present)\n\nThis assessment confirms that the code is safe and does not pose security concerns.",
