  "purpose": "Utility mixins for SVG attribute management, including viewBox, transform, link references, presentation attributes, media groups, markers, and clipping.",
  "sources": "Attribute assignments within class methods, method parameters, and internal utility functions.",
  "sinks": "Attribute dictionaries being set with stringified values, references via URL schemes, and internal method calls for ID updates.",
  "flows": "Input parameters and internal object attributes flow into attribute strings and references; no external data or code execution occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward attribute setting and reference management for SVG elements. It uses safe string formatting, handles references properly, and does not execute external code or network operations. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is present. The functions are utility-focused, with no signs of sabotage or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of safe, standard SVG attribute mixins with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
