{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes and functions to generate SVG filter elements and primitives, allowing dynamic creation and composition of SVG filters.",
  "sources": "Input sources include function parameters such as 'start', 'size', 'resolution', 'inherit', and method arguments like 'href' for images.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include setting attributes with untrusted data (e.g., 'href' in _feImage), which could lead to malicious SVG content if manipulated, but no network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data flows from function parameters (e.g., 'href') into SVG element attributes; no external data streams or network communications are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behavior observed. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or backdoors. Use of dynamic attribute assignment is typical for SVG generation.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily constructs SVG filter elements and primitives, with dynamic attribute setting based on input parameters. The class hierarchy and methods are straightforward, with no indications of malicious intent. The only point of concern could be the 'href' attribute in _feImage, which, if supplied with untrusted data, could embed malicious external resources. However, this is typical for SVG image embedding and not inherently malicious. There are no network calls, no code injection mechanisms, and no data exfiltration activities present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate SVG filter generation library with no evidence of malicious behavior. Its functionality aligns with standard SVG construction patterns, and no suspicious or malicious code features are detected.",
