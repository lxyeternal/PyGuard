  "purpose": "Provides classes and functions to generate SVG filter primitives and filter containers, enabling programmatic creation of SVG filter effects.",
  "sources": "Attributes like 'href' in _feImage, parameters in constructors such as 'azimuth', 'elevation', 'source', 'target', and dynamic attribute access via __getattr__.",
  "sinks": "The 'href' attribute in _feImage which can embed external resources; dynamic creation of filter primitives via __getattr__ which could be exploited if attribute names are externally controlled.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into object attributes during initialization; 'href' set via set_href method; dynamic attribute access via __getattr__ creates filter primitives added to the parent Filter object.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'href' attribute without validation; dynamic attribute access via __getattr__ limited to known filter classes; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for SVG filter primitives and a container 'Filter'. It uses controlled dynamic attribute access to create filter primitives, and 'href' attributes in _feImage are used for embedding external resources. No network activity, code injection, or malicious logic is present. The 'set_href' method's implementation isn't shown but is presumed to set the 'href' attribute safely. The overall structure is straightforward and aligns with standard SVG generation libraries. The potential risk lies in untrusted 'href' values, but this is typical in SVG content and not inherently malicious. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with this analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate SVG filter creation utility with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only minor concern is the embedding of external resources via 'href', which is standard in SVGs but should be sanitized if user input is involved. Overall, the code is safe and well-structured.",
