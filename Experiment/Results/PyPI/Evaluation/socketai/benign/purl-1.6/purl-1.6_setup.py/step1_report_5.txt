  "purpose": "This script is used to package and distribute a Python project named 'purl' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' for long_description, user input is not directly read in this script.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; the script mainly defines package metadata.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the script is for package setup only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and defines a setup configuration for packaging. It reads the README file for the long description and specifies dependencies, package info, and classifiers. There are no code injection points, no network calls, nor any execution of untrusted data. All code is standard for Python package setup, with no obfuscated code or hidden logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and typical for its purpose.",
