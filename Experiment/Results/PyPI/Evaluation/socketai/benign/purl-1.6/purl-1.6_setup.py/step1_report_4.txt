  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distribution of the 'purl' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' file for long_description, metadata definitions, and dependencies specified in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data is used to influence system behavior or sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual code constructs are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup procedures using setuptools: defining package metadata, reading a README file for long description, specifying dependencies, and configuring classifiers. All actions follow common packaging conventions. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are observed, such as network activity, code execution, or data leakage. The code appears to be a typical setup script with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It solely prepares the package for distribution without performing any runtime operations that could be malicious.",
