  "purpose": "To configure and prepare the Python package 'purl' for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.rst' file for long_description, retrieving package files via find_packages.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; the setup script only reads static files and uses package metadata.",
  "flows": "Reads 'README.rst' content and package data; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() to read a local file without validation is standard in setup scripts; no anomalies observed.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. It reads a README file for a description and excludes test packages. No input validation or dynamic code execution present. No suspicious or malicious code patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for Python packaging with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain threats.",
