  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging and distributing a Python library called 'purl'.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst' for long_description; reads package metadata and dependencies; no external input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or user input; only standard package setup functions.",
  "flows": "N/A - no untrusted data flow or input handling; the script performs static configuration for packaging.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. Usage of standard setuptools functions and attributes.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools for packaging, defines package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. It reads the README file for description. No dynamic code execution, no user input, no network activity, and no suspicious code patterns. The code appears to be a typical setup.py script with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious behavior identified. It simply configures package metadata for distribution.",
