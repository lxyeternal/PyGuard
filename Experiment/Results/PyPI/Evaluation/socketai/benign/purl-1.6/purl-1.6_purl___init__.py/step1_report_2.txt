{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define an interface or API for a Python package, importing specific classes and functions for external use and setting package metadata.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.url and .template), which are internal dependencies; no external data sources or user inputs are read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process or output untrusted data, nor does it execute or evaluate any data that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving external or untrusted sources; the code only sets up internal imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious constructs. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports specific classes/functions from local modules and defines package metadata (__version__ and __all__). There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, and no external network activity. The structure and content are consistent with standard package setup code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module interface and metadata definition without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
