{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an __init__.py file to export specific components (URL, expand, Template) from the package modules.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.url and .template), defines __version__ and __all__ variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input or lead to data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Imports and variable definitions are static; no data flow or processing of untrusted data occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns. No dynamic execution or external communication observed.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports modules and defines package exports. It uses standard Python syntax for module exports and versioning. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident. The imports are from local modules, which are not shown, but their usage here appears standard. The version string is static and not influenced by external data.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard package initializer with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It solely manages module exports and versioning with no evidence of security risks.",
