  "purpose": "This code module appears to serve as an import/export interface, exposing classes and functions related to URL handling and template expansion.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules (.url and .template), which are internal code dependencies",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling present in this snippet",
  "flows": "The module imports internal components and exposes them through __all__, with no data processing or flow control involved",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures detected; the version string is straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages module exports and versioning information. It imports components from internal modules and defines the __all__ attribute for controlled exports. There is no evidence of input handling, data processing, or untrusted data flows. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is minimal, standard, and clean.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard module interface with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply re-exports selected components for external use.",
