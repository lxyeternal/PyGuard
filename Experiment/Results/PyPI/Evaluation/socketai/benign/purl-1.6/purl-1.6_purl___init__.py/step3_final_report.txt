{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initializer, importing internal modules and defining metadata for export.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules `.url` and `.template`, static assignment of `__version__`.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, external communication, or untrusted input handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows; only static imports and attribute definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and export pattern with no suspicious or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard `__init__.py` file for a Python package. It imports internal components, sets version metadata, and defines `__all__`. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and high confidence. The structure and content are typical for package setup code, and no anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initialization script with no security issues or malicious intent. All assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
