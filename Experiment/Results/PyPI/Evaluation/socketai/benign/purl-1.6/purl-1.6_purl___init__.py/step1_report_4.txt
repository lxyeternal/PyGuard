  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports specific classes and functions from local submodules and sets module metadata.",
  "sources": "Imports from '.url' and '.template' modules",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no data handling or external data output occurs",
  "flows": "The module imports are straightforward and do not involve data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or suspicious logic present",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific components from local modules and defines a version string and __all__ for exports. No user input handling, network activity, or data processing occurs here. The code structure is standard for a Python package's __init__.py file. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package initialization file with no malicious or suspicious content. It simply imports components and defines module metadata, presenting no security concerns.",
