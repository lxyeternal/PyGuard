{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module initialization file that imports specific components (URL, expand, Template) from local submodules and defines package metadata.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from local modules (.url and .template) via import statements and assigns a version string.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data flows or could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists in this code; it primarily sets up exports and metadata.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward; no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports components from internal modules, sets a version string, and defines __all__ for module exports. There are no input reads, no processing logic, and no network or system calls. It functions solely as a package setup script with standard practices. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard module initialization file with no malicious behavior or security concerns. It simply imports and exports components, and defines metadata.",
