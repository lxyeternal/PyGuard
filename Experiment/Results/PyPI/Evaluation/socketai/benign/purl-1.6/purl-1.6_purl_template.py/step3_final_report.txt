{
  "purpose": "The code implements a URL template expansion utility based on RFC 6570, supporting variable substitution, escaping, and URL object creation.",
  "sources": "Reads input URL template string, variables dictionary, and pattern matches via regex.",
  "sinks": "Outputs expanded URL string wrapped in a URL object; no direct data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Input template -> _replace function via regex substitution -> URL object creation with expanded URL.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; straightforward implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard URL template expansion with safe URL encoding functions, no malicious or obfuscated code, and relies on an external URL parser assumed to be safe. No network, file, or system command operations are present. The malware score is 0, reflecting no malicious intent. The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is clear. The security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate given potential misuse with untrusted input but does not indicate a threat. All reports align in these assessments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard URL template expansion utility with no signs of malware or malicious obfuscation. The assigned scores are justified and consistent with its functionality.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
