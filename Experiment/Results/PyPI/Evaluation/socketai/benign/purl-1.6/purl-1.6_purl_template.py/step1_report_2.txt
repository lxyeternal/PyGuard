{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for URL template expansion, pattern matching, and variable formatting to generate URLs dynamically based on input variables.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the 'variables' dictionary passed to the 'expand' function and from URL template strings provided to the 'Template' class and 'expand' function.",
  "sinks": "The code formats URL components and encodes values for URL safety, but does not perform any dangerous operations like network connections, file access, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Variables are retrieved from the 'variables' dict, processed through format and escape functions, and then integrated into URL templates via the '_replace' function using regex pattern matching.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses regular expressions, partial functions, and dynamic string manipulations typical of URL templating; no suspicious code or hidden behaviors detected. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements URL template parsing and expansion, including pattern matching, variable escaping, and formatting. It uses standard practices like regex, partial functions, and modular formatting. No code injection, network operations, or sensitive data handling is present. All functions perform safe string manipulations and URL encoding, with no signs of malicious behavior. The code is straightforward, primarily designed for URL construction, and does not contain obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard URL template expansion utility with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It performs safe URL encoding and string formatting for URL generation purposes. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data leakage.",
