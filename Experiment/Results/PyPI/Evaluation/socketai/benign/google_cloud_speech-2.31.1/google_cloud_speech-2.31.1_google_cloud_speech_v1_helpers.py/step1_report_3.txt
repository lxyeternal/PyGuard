{
  "purpose": "Provide helper methods for streaming speech recognition using Google Cloud Speech API.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration objects (config), request objects (requests), and metadata; also reads retry and timeout parameters.",
  "sinks": "The code does not send untrusted data to external systems or perform any output operations.",
  "flows": "Generates a configuration dictionary and request objects, then yields them for streaming recognition.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors observed. The method _streaming_request_iterable yields a dictionary, but this is documented as a helper for internal use, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with a method for streaming speech recognition, including detailed docstrings and example usage. It uses a generator to yield configuration and request objects, which appears standard. No code injection, data leakage, or suspicious network activity is present. Usage of the Google Cloud API library is typical, and there are no signs of malicious behavior. The only potentially noteworthy aspect is yielding a dictionary in _streaming_request_iterable, but this aligns with the documented design intent for internal use and flexibility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard helper class for Google Cloud Speech API streaming recognition. No malicious or maliciously obfuscated code is present. The implementation is straightforward, with no signs of security risks or malware.",
