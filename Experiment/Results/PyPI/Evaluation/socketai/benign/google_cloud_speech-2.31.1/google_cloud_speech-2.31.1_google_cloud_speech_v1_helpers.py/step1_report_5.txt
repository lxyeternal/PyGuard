{
  "purpose": "Provides helper methods for the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API to facilitate streaming recognition.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'config' and 'requests' in streaming_recognize method; metadata provided as method argument.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks present; no data leaks or untrusted data processing outside input parameters.",
  "flows": "Input data from 'config' and 'requests' flows through '_streaming_request_iterable' generator, which yields a dictionary with config followed by requests.",
  "anomalies": "The method yields a dictionary with key 'streaming_config' instead of request objects, which is unusual but documented as a helper for multiple API versions. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a helper class for Google Cloud Speech API, providing a method to perform streaming recognition. It properly accepts configuration and request data, with no evidence of malicious behavior. The generator yields a configuration dictionary followed by request objects, which is consistent with API expectations. There are no hardcoded credentials, network calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code is well-documented, and the only potentially suspicious aspect is the unconventional generator yielding a dictionary, but it is explicitly documented as a helper pattern. Overall, no malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate helper class for speech recognition with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It performs standard data flow within a helper context and follows expected patterns for API helpers.",
