{
  "purpose": "Provide convenience methods for the Google Cloud Speech API, specifically for streaming speech recognition.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to the streaming_recognize method (config, requests), and the method itself as it processes these inputs.",
  "sinks": "The method returns an iterable of recognition responses; no direct data leaks are apparent.",
  "flows": "Input config and requests are passed into the streaming_recognize method, which then calls a superclass method. The _streaming_request_iterable generator yields a configuration dictionary followed by request objects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious data handling, or unusual code behavior are observed. The code uses standard API client patterns and a generator to format input data.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a helper class for speech recognition using Google's API. It includes a method to perform streaming recognition, which accepts configuration and request objects, and a private generator to prepare the request stream. The code appears to be a standard API wrapper with no suspicious logic or malicious behavior. No untrusted data processing, insecure operations, or hidden backdoors are present. The code's structure, comments, and usage are consistent with normal SDK implementation practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, safe wrapper for Google's Speech API streaming recognition. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or security risks. The code serves its intended purpose without suspicious features.",
