  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no data handling or output functions present",
  "flows": "Imports from local modules; no data flow or untrusted data flow observed",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior; straightforward module setup",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes from internal modules, sets __all__ for exports, and includes licensing comments. No dynamic execution, external data handling, or suspicious constructs are present. The structure appears standard for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical Python package initialization file with no malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
