{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define and export classes related to adaptation clients, likely part of a larger SDK or library for interacting with a service.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.async_client and .client), and the module's __all__ definition",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or user input are present in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only imports and exports class names",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns are present",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, consisting solely of import statements and an __all__ declaration, which defines the public API of the module. It does not contain any logic, data processing, or interaction with external inputs. No signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module initialization that exports specific classes for external use. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
