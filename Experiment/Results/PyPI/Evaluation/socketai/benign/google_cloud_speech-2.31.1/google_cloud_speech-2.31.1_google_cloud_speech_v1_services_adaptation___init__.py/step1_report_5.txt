{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports and exposes client classes for adaptation, likely part of a larger SDK or API client library.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .async_client and .client",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external calls present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only imports and exports classes",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code structure is straightforward and standard for Python modules",
  "analysis": "The code defines licensing information, imports two classes from local modules, and sets __all__ for exports. No data input, user interaction, or external communication is present. The code contains no obfuscated patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. It appears to be a simple package __init__.py file to re-export classes for easier access.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initialization file with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply imports and exposes classes for use in other modules.",
