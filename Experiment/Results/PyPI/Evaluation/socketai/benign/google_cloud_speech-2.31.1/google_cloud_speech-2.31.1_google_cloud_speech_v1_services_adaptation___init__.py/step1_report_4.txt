  "purpose": "This code serves as an import interface for two classes, AdaptationClient and AdaptationAsyncClient, facilitating their export for external use.",
  "sources": "The code imports classes from local modules (.async_client and .client).",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling functions are present; the code only defines exports.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only exposes imported classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present. The licensing comments are standard and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing classes from local modules and defining __all__ for module exports. There is no input/output handling, no network activity, and no dynamic code execution. The structure aligns with typical Python module setup files. No suspicious or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple module that exports specific classes for external use. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
