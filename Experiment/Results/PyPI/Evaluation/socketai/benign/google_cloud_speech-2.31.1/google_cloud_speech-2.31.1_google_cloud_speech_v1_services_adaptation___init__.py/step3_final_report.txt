{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer that imports specific classes from local submodules and exposes them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads static import statements from local modules (.async_client and .client).",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a standard module setup with licensing comments and import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Python module that imports classes and defines __all__, with no logic, data handling, or network activity. All reviews correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe module initialization file with no malicious or security concerns. All reports and scores are accurate and justified.",
