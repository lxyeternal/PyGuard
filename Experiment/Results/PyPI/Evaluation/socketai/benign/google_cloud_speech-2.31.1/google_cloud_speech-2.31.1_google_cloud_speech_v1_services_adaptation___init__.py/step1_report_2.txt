{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that exports client classes for some API or service, specifically 'AdaptationClient' and 'AdaptationAsyncClient'.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .async_client and .client",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no data processing, external connections, or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flows are apparent; the code only imports and exports classes without processing input",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module definition, importing specific classes from local modules and exposing them via __all__ for external use. It contains licensing comments and standard Python import/export patterns. There are no signs of malicious activity, no data handling, no network communication, and no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module with no malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely as an interface to expose client classes for external modules.",
