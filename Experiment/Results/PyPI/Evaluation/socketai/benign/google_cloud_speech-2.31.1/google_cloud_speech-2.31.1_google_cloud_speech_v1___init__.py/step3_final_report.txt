{
  "purpose": "This code sets up import statements, class definitions, and exports for the Google Cloud Speech API client library, serving as a structural SDK module.",
  "sources": "Static import statements, version info, class and type definitions, no external or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data flows from untrusted sources; no dynamic code execution or external data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A - static setup with no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard SDK setup module, importing necessary classes and types, defining a combined client class, and exporting symbols. It contains no dynamic behavior, no data processing, and no external calls that could introduce security vulnerabilities. The structure is typical for client library packages, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a standard, well-structured SDK setup for Google Cloud Speech API. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
