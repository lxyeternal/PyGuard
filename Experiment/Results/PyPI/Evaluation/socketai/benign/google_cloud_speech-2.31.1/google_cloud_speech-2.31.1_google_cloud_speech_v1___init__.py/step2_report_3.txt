  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard client library setup, importing classes and defining a combined client class. No dynamic code, no data processing, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, no data flows from untrusted sources.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 seem appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code is purely structural and intended for API interaction.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's assessment appears accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the setup nature of the code, with no dynamic execution or data handling.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; this is standard SDK setup code.\n\n**Conclusion:** No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a straightforward module setting up imports and class exports for the Google Cloud Speech SDK.\n- **Findings:** No data processing, no external calls, no secrets.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are justified.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly identifies this as benign SDK wrapper code.\n\n**Conclusion:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, focusing on the module's role as an SDK setup.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity, no data leaks, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 seem correct.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; no malicious intent detected.\n\n**Conclusion:** No adjustments required.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above—importing classes and setting up exports for the API client.\n- **Findings:** No data flows, no dynamic code, no secrets.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Conclusion:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code is purely structural, intended for API client setup.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; all reports agree.\n- **Risk score:** Given the nature of the code—just library setup—risk scores of 0 are justified.\n\n### Final recommendation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. No suspicious behavior, no vulnerabilities, no malicious code, and no obfuscation are present.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, benign SDK setup module with no security concerns.",
