  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows detected.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only defines static metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of licensing comments and version string is normal; no suspicious or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments related to licensing and a single assignment of a version string. There are no functions, input/output, or dynamic code execution. The code appears to serve as package metadata or documentation, with no apparent malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard license and version declaration, with no malicious intent, suspicious activity, or security risks identified. The code is safe and typical for Python package files.",
