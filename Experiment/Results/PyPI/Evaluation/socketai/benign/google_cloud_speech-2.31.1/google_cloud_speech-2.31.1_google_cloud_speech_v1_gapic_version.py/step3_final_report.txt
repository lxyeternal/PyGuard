  "purpose": "This code serves as a license header and version metadata for an open-source Python project.",
  "sources": "The version string assignment (__version__ = \"2.31.1\") and comments containing licensing information.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows are present; the code contains only comments and a static variable assignment.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code is static metadata with no dynamic or input/output operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments and a version string assignment, with no executable logic, data processing, or external data handling. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the content. There are no anomalies or suspicious elements. The code is standard metadata, posing no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard license header with no malicious or obfuscated content. All assessments and scores are accurate and justified. No further action or concern is warranted.",
