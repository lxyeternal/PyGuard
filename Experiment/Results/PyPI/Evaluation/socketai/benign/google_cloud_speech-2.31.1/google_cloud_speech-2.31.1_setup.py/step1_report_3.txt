  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the 'google-cloud-speech' Python package, including version extraction, dependencies, and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads version from 'gapic_version.py', reads README file, and uses setuptools to find packages.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data exfiltration points identified.",
  "flows": "Reads version information from a local file, then proceeds with package setup without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected; standard package setup pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup tasks for a Python package, including reading version info from a local file, reading a README, defining dependencies, and invoking setuptools.setup() with metadata. All actions are typical for package distribution, with no indication of malicious activities such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The version extraction uses regex to parse a version string, which is a common pattern. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It follows standard practices and contains no anomalies or suspicious behaviors.",
