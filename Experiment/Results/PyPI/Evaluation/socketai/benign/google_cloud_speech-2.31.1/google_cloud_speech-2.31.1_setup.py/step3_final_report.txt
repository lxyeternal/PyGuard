{
  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'google-cloud-speech', performing version extraction, reading README, and configuring dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'gapic_version.py' via regex; reads README file; static data in setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Static data flow from local files into setup configuration; no dynamic or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that reads version info using regex, loads README content, and calls setuptools.setup() with static, predefined parameters. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted input handling is present. The regex usage is straightforward and safe. Dependencies are explicitly specified with version constraints. Overall, the script performs benign package configuration tasks without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The minor security risk score of 0.1 assigned in one report is unwarranted; it should be adjusted to 0 for consistency. The malware score remains 0, obfuscation score 0, and overall security risk 0.",
