  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The minor security risk score of 0.1 assigned in one report is unwarranted; it should be adjusted to 0 for consistency. The malware score remains 0, obfuscation score 0, and overall security risk 0."
