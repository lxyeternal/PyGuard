  "purpose": "Setup script for the google-cloud-speech Python package, handling package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads package version from a file ('gapic_version.py'), reads README.rst file for long description, and loads dependencies and package information.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted or external data; the script only reads static files and defines package setup parameters.",
  "flows": "Reads version info and README content, then passes static data to setuptools.setup() for package creation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious behavior detected. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious operations present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup operations for a Python package, including reading version info from a file, loading a README, and configuring dependencies and package metadata. All actions involve static files or predefined variables. The code does not execute any untrusted input or perform network operations. It strictly adheres to common package setup practices, with no indications of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a legitimate package setup configuration without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It performs expected setup tasks using static data and well-known libraries.",
