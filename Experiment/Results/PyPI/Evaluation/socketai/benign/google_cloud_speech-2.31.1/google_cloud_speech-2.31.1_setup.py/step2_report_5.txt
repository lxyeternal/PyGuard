  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to verify the presence of issues, assess the reasoning, and ensure the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The script is a standard setup configuration, reading version info from a file, reading README, and setting dependencies. No suspicious activity detected.\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, with no dynamic execution or untrusted input processing. The regex for version extraction is safe given the context.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Confidence = 1.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, confirms standard setup process, no malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** No untrusted data, no network activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Confidence = 1.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a typical setup script, reading version info, dependencies, and metadata.\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious code, no dynamic or malicious logic.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Confidence = 1.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with a note that the only potential concern is the use of regex to parse version info.\n- **Assessment:** The regex is simple and used to parse a version string from a local file; this is a common pattern and not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Discussion:** The assigned security risk score of 0.1 is very low and justified, considering the regex parsing is benign and no external data is involved.\n\n**Verdict:** The score seems appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as previous, standard setup script, no suspicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** All actions are static, with no dynamic code, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Code:** None detected in any report.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Risk Scores:** All are appropriately low, given the benign nature of the script.\n- **Malware Score:** Correctly set to 0 in all cases; no malicious activity.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\nBased on all reports, the code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The minor risk score of 0.1 in one report is justified by the regex usage, which is safe.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign, standard nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent and accurate. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The scoring aligns with the code's content.",
