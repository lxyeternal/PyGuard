  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; it does not process untrusted data or perform any operations beyond static comments.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only contains comments and licensing information.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only license comments; no executable or suspicious code is present. No anomalies or malicious code are detected.",
  "analysis": "This snippet is purely a header comment with licensing information. It does not include any executable code, user input handling, or data processing. Therefore, there are no security risks, malicious behaviors, or obfuscated code. It is standard licensing boilerplate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign license header with no malicious intent or security issues. It is typical in open-source projects and poses no threat.",
