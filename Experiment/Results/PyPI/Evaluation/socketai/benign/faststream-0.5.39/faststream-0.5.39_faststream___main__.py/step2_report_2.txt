  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The script attempts to import `cli` from `faststream.cli.main`.\n- If the import fails, it raises an ImportError instructing the user to install `faststream[cli]`.\n- It sets a warning filter for `ImportWarning` in the `faststream` module.\n- When run as `__main__`, it calls `cli(prog_name=\"faststream\")`.\n- The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or obfuscated code.\n- The only external dependency is the `faststream` package, which is assumed to be trusted.\n- There are no network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious constructs.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports agree that the code is a simple CLI bootstrap with dependency checks and no malicious activity.\n\n- **Are there errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  **No.** The logic is standard and correct for a CLI entry point.\n\n- **Are the scores assigned reasonable?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, and security risk as very low (0.1 or 0). This aligns with the code's nature.\n\n- **Is the malware score justified?**  \n  **Yes.** No malicious behavior is present. The `cli` function is external, but nothing in this code indicates malicious intent.\n\n- **Are claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \n  **No.** The reports correctly identify that the code does not process untrusted data or perform risky operations.\n\n- **Are scores consistent?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports give high confidence (1.0), zero obfuscation, zero malware, and very low security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The code is a typical CLI bootstrap with dependency handling.\n- No suspicious or malicious constructs are present.\n- The only potential concern could be if `cli` internally executes untrusted code, but that is outside the scope of this code snippet and depends on the external `faststream` package.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 is reasonable, given dependency management and potential for misuse if `cli` is malicious internally, but there's no evidence here.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, standard dependency check and CLI invocation)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, straightforward, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
