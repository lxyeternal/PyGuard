{
  "purpose": "CLI entry point for the FastStream framework, intended to invoke the command-line interface.",
  "sources": "Imports 'cli' from 'faststream.cli.main', which is a library component; checks for ImportError.",
  "sinks": "Calls 'cli' function with 'prog_name' argument; potential data flow if 'cli' processes untrusted input, but no explicit untrusted data sources present.",
  "flows": "If 'cli' is imported successfully, the program invokes 'cli' with a fixed parameter. No external data flows are evident beyond the import and function call.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The code checks for module import and provides user instructions.",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to import a CLI function from the 'faststream' package. If the import fails, it prompts the user to install the necessary dependencies. It suppresses certain warnings and, if executed as main, calls the CLI with a predefined program name. No untrusted input is processed directly, and the code primarily manages dependencies and invocation flow.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a safe CLI launcher for the FastStream framework. It performs standard import checks, user guidance, and invocation without processing or executing untrusted data. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
