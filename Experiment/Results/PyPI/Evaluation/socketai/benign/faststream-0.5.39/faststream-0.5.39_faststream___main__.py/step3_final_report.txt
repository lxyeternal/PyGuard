  "purpose": "CLI bootstrap for the FastStream framework, handling dependency import and invoking the CLI.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'cli' from 'faststream.cli.main'; the module 'faststream' and its submodules.",
  "sinks": "The call to 'cli(prog_name=\"faststream\")' when run as main; no untrusted data processing or external effects detected.",
  "flows": "Import of 'cli' -> check for import success -> set warning filter -> invoke 'cli' if __name__ == '__main__'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual constructs. Standard dependency handling and CLI invocation.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import a CLI handler, provides user guidance if missing, sets a warning filter, and executes the CLI when run directly. No malicious, obfuscated, or insecure patterns are present. The external 'cli' function's behavior is unknown but presumed safe. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious code are evident. The code follows best practices for CLI entry points, with dependency checks and user instructions. No vulnerabilities or anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, safe CLI bootstrap script with no malicious intent or suspicious elements. All signals indicate benign behavior, and the scores reflect minimal security concern.",
