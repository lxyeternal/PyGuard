  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code is a straightforward CLI entry point for the FastStream framework.\n- It attempts to import a CLI function, handles missing dependencies gracefully, and invokes the CLI if available.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code is present.\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is safe, with no security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code's logic and flow are correct.\n- No malicious behavior, malware, or obfuscation detected.\n- The import handling and user guidance are standard and safe.\n- The 'cli' function's internal behavior is external and not part of this code snippet; based on the provided code, no malicious activity can be inferred.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No errors or flaws are evident in the code or reasoning.\n- The dependency check and error message are appropriate.\n- The warning filter setup is standard.\n\n### Score Review:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with clear, straightforward code.\n- **Security Risk Score:** 0.1 in report 1 is slightly higher than zero but justified by the potential risk if 'cli' internally executes untrusted commands. However, given only this code, no evidence suggests any actual risk.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n- The **malware score** should remain **0**; no malicious activity is present.\n- The **obfuscated score** should remain **0**; no obfuscation detected.\n- The **security risk score** could be slightly above zero (e.g., 0.1) to reflect the potential if 'cli' executes untrusted code, but since the code itself doesn't do this, a score of **0** is justified.\n\n### Potential Risks:\n- The only possible concern is if the 'cli' function internally executes untrusted commands or code. But this is external to this code snippet, and no evidence supports that suspicion here.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a safe, standard CLI bootstrap with proper dependency handling and no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign.\n- The reports are accurate in their assessments.\n- No changes needed in scores or conclusions.\n\n**Note:** If future analysis includes the internal implementation of 'cli', then a re-evaluation might be necessary. But based solely on this snippet, the current scores are appropriate.",
