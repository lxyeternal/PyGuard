  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of each report:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward CLI entry point for the FastStream framework.\n- The code attempts to import a 'cli' function from 'faststream.cli.main', handles import errors gracefully with user instructions, sets a warning filter, and calls 'cli' if run directly.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code is detected.\n- The sources, sinks, and flows are standard for CLI bootstrap scripts.\n- No external data, network activity, or untrusted input processing is evident.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a very low security risk score (mostly 0 or 0.1).\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code is functional, standard, and safe.\n- No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious constructs.\n- The 'cli' function's internal behavior is external to this snippet, but based on the report, it appears to be a typical CLI handler.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- None detected. The code is straightforward and follows best practices for dependency checking and CLI invocation.\n- The only potential concern is the reliance on the 'cli' function from an external package, but this is standard for CLI entry points.\n\n### Scores and their reasonableness:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports, which is appropriate given the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, correct.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, mostly 0 or 0.1, which seems reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign such scores, and given the code's benign nature, none are justified.\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities:\n- The code does not process untrusted input directly; the 'cli' function's behavior is external.\n- The import handling is standard and safe.\n- No assumptions about external 'cli' execution should be made without inspecting 'faststream.cli.main'.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All reports are consistent with each other and with the code content.\n- The overall assessment aligns with the code's straightforward nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 (due to dependency management and potential for external 'cli' to execute commands, but no evidence of malicious intent)\n\n**Overall security assessment:**  \nThe code is a typical, safe CLI bootstrap script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The low risk score reflects the minimal security concern based on this snippet.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If I were to assign my own scores based on the review:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to dependency reliance, but not a security concern)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's nature.",
