  "purpose": "This script serves as a command-line interface (CLI) entry point for the FastStream framework, primarily managing imports and executing the CLI.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'faststream.cli.main', user input via command line execution (__name__ == '__main__')",
  "sinks": "Calling 'cli' function from the 'faststream.cli.main' module",
  "flows": "Importing 'cli' -> Checking if import succeeded -> Raising error if not -> Filtering warnings -> Executing 'cli' if script is run directly",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code performs standard import, error handling, and CLI invocation without suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import a CLI function from 'faststream.cli.main'. If the import fails, it sets a flag and raises a user-friendly error instructing to install the 'faststream[cli]' dependencies. It filters warnings for better user experience and executes the CLI when run directly. There are no signs of malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns. The control flow is straightforward and typical for CLI entry points.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard CLI entry point for the FastStream framework with proper error handling and warning filtering. No malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks are identified.",
