  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward CLI entry point that imports a function, handles import errors, sets warning filters, and executes the CLI if run directly.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are detected.\n- The only potential concern is the execution of the `cli()` function, which depends on external code (`faststream.cli.main`). However, within this code snippet, there's no indication that `cli()` is malicious or does anything harmful.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code correctly handles missing dependencies by raising an informative error.\n- No anomalies, suspicious constructs, or obfuscation are present.\n- The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or contain backdoors.\n- The `cli()` function's internal behavior is external to this snippet, so risks depend on that implementation, but nothing suspicious is implied here.\n\n### Error, flaws, or mistakes:\n- No errors or flaws are evident in the code.\n- The logic and reasoning are sound and standard for CLI bootstrap scripts.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Security risk:** Very low (0 or 0.1), which is reasonable given the code's nature.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0 across all reports, justified by the straightforward analysis.\n\n### Justifications:\n- The risk scores are reasonable and aligned with the code's simplicity.\n- No reason to increase the malware score; no malicious behavior detected.\n- The code's purpose is benign: dependency check and CLI invocation.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nBased on the detailed review, I agree with the provided scores. The code appears safe, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, mainly dependency management)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard, safe CLI bootstrap script with no security risks or malicious activity. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
