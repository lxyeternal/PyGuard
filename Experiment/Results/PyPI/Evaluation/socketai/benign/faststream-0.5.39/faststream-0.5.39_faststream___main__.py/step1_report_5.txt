  "purpose": "CLI entry point for the FastStream framework, used to invoke the command-line interface.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'faststream.cli.main', which loads the CLI command handler.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'cli(prog_name=\"faststream\")' which runs the CLI; potential risk if 'cli' executes untrusted code or commands.",
  "flows": "Import 'cli' -> if available, call 'cli' with 'prog_name=\"faststream\"'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The import is conditional, handling missing dependencies gracefully.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import the CLI handler from 'faststream.cli.main'. If import fails, it raises an informative error about missing dependencies. If successful, it sets a warning filter and executes the 'cli' function with a specified program name. The control flow is straightforward, and no suspicious or malicious code is present. The execution of 'cli' depends on the implementation of 'faststream', which is external, but within this code, there are no indications of malicious behavior. No obfuscation or hidden logic is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI launcher for the FastStream framework with proper dependency handling. There are no signs of malicious activity or security issues in this snippet.",
