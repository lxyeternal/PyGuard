  "purpose": "CLI entry point for the FastStream framework, used to initialize and run the command-line interface.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'faststream.cli.main' module and dynamic import error handling.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'cli' function from imported module, which could potentially process user input.",
  "flows": "Import of CLI function -> conditional check for import success -> calling cli(prog_name) if present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious behavior, or malicious code patterns detected. Import error handling is standard. No obfuscated code, no unusual dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to import the 'cli' function from 'faststream.cli.main'. If unsuccessful, it raises an informative ImportError instructing users to install the 'faststream[cli]' dependency. If successful, it sets warning filters and invokes 'cli' with a program name. The logic is straightforward and typical for CLI entry points, with no signs of malicious activity or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a typical CLI bootstrap for the FastStream framework with standard error handling and no malicious or suspicious elements detected. It does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or contain backdoors.",
