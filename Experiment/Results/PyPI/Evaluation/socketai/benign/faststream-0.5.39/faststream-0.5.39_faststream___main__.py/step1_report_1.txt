{
  "purpose": "CLI entry point for the FastStream framework, intended to run the CLI commands if dependencies are installed.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'faststream.cli.main', environment variables (via warnings filter), script execution via '__main__' block",
  "sinks": "Calling 'cli(prog_name=\"faststream\")' which executes the CLI command, potential to run external commands if 'cli' internally executes any system commands",
  "flows": "Import attempt → Dependency check → Warning filter setup → CLI invocation on script run",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious imports or network calls, standard dependency check pattern, no obfuscated code or unusual constructs",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import a CLI function from 'faststream.cli.main'. If the import fails, it raises an ImportError with instructions for the user to install the necessary package. It sets a warning filter for ImportWarning in the 'faststream' module. If run directly, it executes the CLI with the program name 'faststream'. The code is straightforward, handling missing dependencies gracefully, and does not contain any suspicious or malicious constructs. No external data is read directly, and the only output is an error message or CLI execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a safe CLI entry point for the FastStream framework, with proper dependency checks and user guidance. It contains no malicious intent, malware, or security risks based on the provided content.",
