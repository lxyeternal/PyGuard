  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Static type aliases, protocols, and a placeholder class.\n- **Data Flow & Anomalies:** No data flows from untrusted sources; no suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is purely structural, with no runtime logic or external data handling. The optional import pattern is standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0, Confidence 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior detected. The high confidence reflects the static, non-executing nature of the code.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing static type definitions and protocols.\n- No data processing, external communication, or suspicious constructs.\n- Scores: Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0, Confidence 1.\n- Assessment: Safe, purely structural code.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same pattern: type aliases, protocols, optional import, placeholder class.\n- No runtime logic or data flow.\n- Scores: Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0, Confidence 1.\n- Assessment: No malicious activity.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Again, type definitions, protocols, optional import, and a placeholder.\n- No data processing or external interactions.\n- Scores: Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0, Confidence 1.\n- Assessment: Safe, static code.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar to others: type aliases, protocols, constants.\n- No runtime or data flow.\n- Scores: Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0, Confidence 0.9.\n- Assessment: No malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity. The code is purely static type definitions and protocols.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden logic.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the absence of runtime logic, data handling, or external interactions, the risk is minimal.\n\n**However,** the reports assign a risk score of 0 in all cases, which aligns with the analysis. The malware scores are also consistently zero, reflecting no malicious intent.\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign, foundational module defining types and protocols. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent with my analysis. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
