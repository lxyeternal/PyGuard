  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of each report:**\n\n- All five reports conclude that the code is primarily static type definitions, protocols, and constants. They emphasize the absence of data processing, external input handling, or runtime logic that could be exploited.\n- The only notable aspect is the conditional import of `BaseModel` from `faststream._compat`, which is a common pattern for optional dependencies.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are identified.\n- The placeholder class `_EmptyPlaceholder` and singleton `EMPTY` are benign and serve as sentinel values.\n\n**Step-by-step review:**\n\n1. **Presence of malicious code or malware:**\n   - No functions, data processing, or network interactions are present.\n   - The code is purely structural and type-related.\n   - No evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in logic:**\n   - The try-except import pattern is standard; no fallback or error handling issues are evident.\n   - The code's purpose is clear and consistent.\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores assigned:**\n   - All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - Security risk scores are also 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - Confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 to 1.0), reflecting the reviewers' certainty.\n\n4. **Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly avoid assuming malicious intent where none exists.\n   - The conditional import is standard practice and not suspicious.\n\n5. **Consistency and justification:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's static, structural nature.\n   - No changes are necessary; the assessments are reasonable.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\nGiven the comprehensive review, I concur with the reports' conclusions. The code is a benign set of type definitions and protocols with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n- Maintain malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0.\n- The code appears safe and suitable for inclusion in a supply chain without security concerns.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Score | Justification                                                                 |\n|-----------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0       | No malicious code, payload, or suspicious behavior detected.               |\n| Obfuscated      | 0       | Code is clear, with no obfuscation or hidden logic.                        |\n| Security Risk   | 0       | No vulnerabilities, data leaks, or security issues identified.            |\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms the code's benign nature.",
