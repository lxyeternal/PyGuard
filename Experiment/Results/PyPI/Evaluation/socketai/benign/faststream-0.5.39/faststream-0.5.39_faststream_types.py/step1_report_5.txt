{
  "purpose": "The code defines type aliases, protocols, and data structures for a Python project, primarily focusing on data modeling and type safety.",
  "sources": "Type alias definitions, import statements, class definitions, and variable initializations.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or untrusted data handling observed; no functions or code that process external input or perform data output.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data, as the code mainly defines static types and protocols.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or hidden behaviors detected. The use of a placeholder object (EMPTY) is standard for representing a sentinel value.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises mostly type alias declarations, protocol definitions, and a placeholder class with an instance 'EMPTY'. It imports standard libraries and attempts to import a class from a possibly optional external package (faststream). The code appears to be for static type hinting and interface design. No code execution, data processing, or input handling is present that could lead to malicious behavior. There are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a collection of type definitions, protocols, and constants used for type safety and code structure within a larger project. It does not contain any malicious or security-risk behavior.",
