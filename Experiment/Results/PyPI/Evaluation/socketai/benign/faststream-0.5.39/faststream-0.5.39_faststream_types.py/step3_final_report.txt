{
  "purpose": "The code defines static type aliases, protocols, and constants used for type safety and system structure within a Python project. It includes optional dependency handling for 'BaseModel' and a sentinel placeholder class.",
  "sources": "Type alias definitions, class and protocol declarations, and the conditional import of 'BaseModel' from 'faststream._compat'.",
  "sinks": "No data sources or sinks; the code contains no runtime data processing, external I/O, or untrusted input handling.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks as the code is purely static and type-related.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns; the code is straightforward, with standard optional import handling and benign placeholder classes.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of type aliases, protocols, and constants that serve as static definitions for use elsewhere. The optional import pattern is standard for handling optional dependencies. The '_EmptyPlaceholder' class and 'EMPTY' singleton are benign sentinel values. There are no functions, data processing, external communication, or runtime logic. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code. The high confidence scores (around 0.9 to 1.0) are justified given the static analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static module defining type aliases, protocols, and constants with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. It is safe for inclusion in a supply chain and requires no further action.",
