{
  "purpose": "This code primarily defines type aliases, protocols, and data structures for a Python project, facilitating type checking, data validation, and logging.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules, class attributes (__dataclass_fields__), and type annotations. No external or untrusted input sources are explicitly used within this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present. There are no operations that process untrusted data sources, nor any network, file, or environment interactions that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code mainly sets up type aliases and protocols without processing runtime data or executing untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only static definitions; no suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior are present. The import fallback for 'BaseModel' appears standard and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of type alias definitions, protocols, and class placeholders used for type safety and structure enforcement. It includes a conditional import to maintain compatibility across different environments. There are no functions executing runtime logic, data processing, or external communications. No signs of obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a static type and protocol definition module without any malicious or suspicious elements. It appears to be safe and typical for a Python project focused on data handling and type checking.",
