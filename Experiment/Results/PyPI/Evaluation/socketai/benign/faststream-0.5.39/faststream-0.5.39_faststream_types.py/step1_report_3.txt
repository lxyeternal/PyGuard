{
  "purpose": "Define various type aliases, protocols, and constants used for type hinting and structure in a Python project, likely related to data serialization, messaging, and logging.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries and optional import for 'faststream._compat'. No external input or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or could lead to vulnerabilities are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external or untrusted sources to sensitive operations; primarily type definitions and protocol declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code consists of type aliases, class protocols, and constants.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of type definitions, protocol interfaces, and constants for type hinting and structural purposes in a larger codebase. It includes optional import handling and a placeholder singleton class. No runtime logic, data processing, or external data interaction is present that could be exploited. The structure is straightforward and adheres to common coding practices without any suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely structural with no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or security risks. It appears to be safe and intended for use as a foundation for type annotations and protocols.",
