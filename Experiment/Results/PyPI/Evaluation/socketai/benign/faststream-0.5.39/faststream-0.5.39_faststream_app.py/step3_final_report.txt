  "purpose": "Defines a FastStream application class with methods for running, converting to ASGI, and handling startup validation errors, using async context managers and exception handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from faststream modules, pydantic ValidationError, contextlib, and fallback fake_context; class methods accessing parameters and internal functions.",
  "sinks": "Raises ValidationError on validation issues; no data leaks or malicious data flow; exception propagation is standard.",
  "flows": "Input parameters and configuration options influence startup, validation, and lifecycle management; validation errors propagate appropriately.",
  "anomalies": "Use of fallback fake_context for missing imports is a common compatibility pattern; no suspicious code structures or secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard async patterns, exception handling, and fallback mechanisms. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. The fallback for validation error handling is benign and typical for compatibility. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's straightforward nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, standard application setup with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score is appropriate, and the absence of malicious behavior is confirmed by the analysis.",
