{
  "purpose": "Define a FastStream application class with methods to run the application and convert it to an ASGI app, along with error handling for startup validation.",
  "sources": "Imports (logging, typing, faststream modules), class methods (run, as_asgi), context manager catch_startup_validation_error, exception handling blocks.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data, no network or file operations, no execution of external code.",
  "flows": "No flow from untrusted input to sensitive operations; code primarily manages internal application lifecycle.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Exception handling is standard; catch_startup_validation_error wraps validation errors, which is normal for validation workflows.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for managing a FastStream application, including lifecycle methods and error handling. The catch_startup_validation_error function captures validation errors from pydantic, which is typical for configuration validation. No network or system manipulation, no dynamic code execution, and no hardcoded credentials are present. The exception handling pattern is standard. Overall, the code appears to be straightforward application scaffolding without malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical application framework implementation with standard error handling. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected. It appears safe and aligned with common usage patterns.",
