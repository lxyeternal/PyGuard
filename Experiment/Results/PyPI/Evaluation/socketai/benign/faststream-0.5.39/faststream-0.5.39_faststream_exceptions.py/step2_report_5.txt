  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Each Report:**\n\n- All five reports describe the code as a straightforward set of custom exception classes used within a FastStream messaging framework.\n- They emphasize that the code contains no external input/output, network operations, or dynamic code execution.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated patterns are detected.\n- The constants are benign strings providing instructions or messages.\n- The exception classes are standard, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe code is purely class definitions for exceptions and constants. There are no vulnerabilities, no malicious payloads, and no code that could be exploited.  \n**Conclusion:** No issues or vulnerabilities are present.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in logic or reasoning\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe code appears correct and idiomatic for defining custom exceptions in Python. The exception classes are well-structured, and the string representations are clear. No logical errors or flaws are evident.  \n**Conclusion:** No errors or flaws are identified.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Review the scores assigned to each issue\n\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The confidence scores are 1.0, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- The scores seem reasonable and consistent across reports.\n\n**Suggestion:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5\n\n- All scores are 0, indicating no risk.  \n- Since the code is purely exception class definitions with no external interactions, this is appropriate.  \n**Conclusion:** No justification for higher scores.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate malware score and potential malicious behavior\n\n- The malware score is 0 in all reports.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or hidden payloads are present.\n- The code is static, with no dynamic or obfuscated elements.\n\n**Conclusion:** Malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Challenge claims based on assumptions\n\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no suspicious assumptions.\n- The only potential concern could be if these exception classes were used maliciously, but as standalone definitions, they are harmless.\n\n**Conclusion:** No assumptions to challenge.\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Check for consistency of scores\n\n- All reports are consistent: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- No discrepancies noted.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Synthesis and Personal Assessment:**\n\nGiven the thorough review, the code is a standard, well-structured set of exception classes for a messaging framework, with no malicious or security-threatening elements.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is purely definitional, with no external data handling, network operations, or dynamic behavior. It serves as part of a larger system but does not introduce vulnerabilities or malicious behavior by itself.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, standard, and free of security risks. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and justified.",
