  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various fast stream processing errors and control flow signals.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; only exception class definitions and constant string messages.",
  "sinks": "No data flow or untrusted data handling occurs within this code.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; only class and string definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no dynamic execution or suspicious imports.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions used for control flow and error handling in a FastStream framework. There are no external data inputs, no untrusted data handling, and no interaction with external systems or network operations. The constants are descriptive string messages for user feedback. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain risks are present. The code structure is standard for defining exceptions and constants, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign set of exception definitions for a Python FastStream application. It contains no suspicious or malicious code, no data leaks, and no malicious behaviors. It appears to be a normal part of an application's error handling system.",
