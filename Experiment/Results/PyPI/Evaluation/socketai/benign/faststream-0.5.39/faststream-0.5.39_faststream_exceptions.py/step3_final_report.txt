{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for control flow, error handling, and messaging within the FastStream framework.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and string constants; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "N/A; static class and constant definitions without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions used for control flow in a messaging system. It includes mechanisms for stopping applications, acknowledging, negatively acknowledging, rejecting messages, and validation errors. The string constants are benign instructions or status messages. No external data, network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation is present. The structure is straightforward, and the code adheres to standard Python practices. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or vulnerabilities are identified. The exception classes include options for passing extra parameters, which is typical in messaging frameworks. The code is purely structural and does not process or handle external data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of exception classes for a messaging framework. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are accurate and appropriate.",
