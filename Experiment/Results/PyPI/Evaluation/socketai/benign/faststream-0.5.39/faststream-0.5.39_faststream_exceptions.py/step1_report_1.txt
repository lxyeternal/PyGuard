{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for a FastStream messaging framework, including control flow exceptions and error types.",
  "sources": "No external input sources or data reading operations; mainly class and exception definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "No data or control flows involving external input or output; class definitions are static.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code is straightforward exception class definitions with descriptive messages and simple initializers.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of custom exception class definitions used for control flow and error handling in a messaging framework. There are no input/output operations, network interactions, or data processing that could be exploited. The exception classes include mechanisms for passing additional options, but these are standard patterns and do not introduce security risks. The included constant strings are benign instructions or messages. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for a messaging framework, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It serves as part of a larger system but does not contain vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors by itself.",
