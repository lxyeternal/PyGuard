  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for FastStream framework to handle various error conditions and control flow.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read in this code. It only defines exception classes and static messages.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external systems are involved; no untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "No data or control flows involving external input; exception classes are used for control flow within the application.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed. The messages and class structures are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of custom exception class definitions for error handling in a messaging framework. There are no data input/output, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The messages and class structures are straightforward and standard for exception handling. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or backdoors are present. The static strings serve descriptive purposes only. Overall, the code appears to be a typical, benign exception hierarchy with no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions for a messaging framework. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. It appears safe and purely structural.",
