  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a set of custom exception classes for a FastStream messaging framework.\n- The code consists solely of class definitions, string constants, and simple initializers.\n- No input/output, network interactions, data processing, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are identified.\n- The purpose is to handle control flow, errors, and messaging states within the framework.\n\n**Specific Points:**\n- The exception classes include mechanisms for stopping the application or handler, acknowledging/nacking/rejecting messages, validation errors, and other control signals.\n- String constants provide user instructions or status messages.\n- No external data sources, sinks, or flows are involved.\n- The code adheres to standard Python practices for defining exceptions.\n\n**Malware and Security Risks:**\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks.\n- No obfuscation or hidden code.\n- The code is purely structural, intended for control flow management.\n\n**Scores Evaluation:**\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, consistent with straightforward, readable code.\n- **Risk:** 0, since there are no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n\n**Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n- The reports are consistent and thorough, with no claims that seem assumption-based or exaggerated.\n- The exception classes are standard and do not introduce security concerns.\n\n**Conclusion and Final Assessment:**\n- Based on the detailed review, the code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions.\n- There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and reasonable.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a safe, standard implementation of exception classes for a messaging framework, with no malicious or security concerns detected.",
