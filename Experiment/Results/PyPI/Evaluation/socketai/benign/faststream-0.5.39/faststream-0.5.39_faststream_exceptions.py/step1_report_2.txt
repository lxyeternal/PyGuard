{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for a FastStream messaging framework and provide some related constants.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; all data consists of class definitions and string constants.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, network operations, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks, as the code only defines exception classes and constants.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to be standard class and exception definitions; no unusual code, obfuscation, or hidden behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of exception class definitions, each with clear purposes, such as handling stopping conditions, message acknowledgment, rejection, validation errors, and other control flow exceptions. String constants provide user instructions. No external inputs, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present. The code is straightforward, readable, and adheres to typical Python patterns for custom exceptions. No suspicious, malicious, or maliciously obfuscated patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception classes and constants used for controlling flow and error handling in a messaging framework. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
