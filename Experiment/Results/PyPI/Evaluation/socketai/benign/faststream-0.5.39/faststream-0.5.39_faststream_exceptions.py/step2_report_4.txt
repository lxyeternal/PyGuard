  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Each Report:**\n\n- All five reports identify that the code consists solely of custom exception class definitions for a FastStream messaging framework.\n- No external input, network operations, data processing, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The exception classes include control flow mechanisms (e.g., StopConsume, StopApplication, AckMessage, NackMessage, RejectMessage).\n- String constants provide user instructions or messages, which are benign.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code patterns are detected.\n- All reports confidently conclude that the code is benign, with a malware score of 0 and no security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Potential Concerns:\n\n- **Code Presence:** The code matches the description: class definitions, exception handling, constants. No anomalies, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation.\n- **Malware and Obfuscation:** All reports agree on malware score 0 and obfuscated score 0.\n- **Security Risks:** No external data handling, network operations, or code execution. The code is purely structural.\n- **Control Flow & Data Flow:** Only exception classes and static strings; no data flow or external interactions.\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes:\n\n- No flaws or mistakes are evident in the reasoning or summaries.\n- The reports are consistent and thorough in their analysis.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports is appropriate. No malicious intent or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 is correct; the code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 is justified; the code is part of error handling and control flow, with no security vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\nGiven the nature of the code—pure class definitions for exceptions with no dynamic or external interactions—the scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — Code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — No vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign, standard set of exception classes for a messaging framework, with no supply chain or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No changes needed; the reports are accurate and consistent.",
