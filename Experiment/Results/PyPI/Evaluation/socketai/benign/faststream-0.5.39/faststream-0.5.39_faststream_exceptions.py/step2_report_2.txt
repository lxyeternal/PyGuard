  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\nAll five reports uniformly describe the code as a set of custom exception classes used in a FastStream messaging framework. They emphasize that the code is straightforward, contains no external input/output, no dynamic behavior, no obfuscation, and no malicious intent. The constants are simple informational messages or instructions for dependency installation. The confidence in all reports is high (1.0), with malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores at 0.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is solely class and constant definitions.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **External data/input:** None present.\n- **Dynamic or network operations:** Absent.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None apparent; the code is purely structural.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- **No issues detected.** The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n### Scores and their reasonableness:\n- **Malware score (0):** Correct, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated (0):** Correct, the code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score (0):** Appropriate, given the benign nature.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The exception classes include mechanisms to pass extra options, which is standard in messaging frameworks.\n- The constants are benign instructions and messages.\n- No assumptions are made beyond what the code shows.\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Overall, the reports are accurate and thorough. They correctly identify the code as non-malicious, straightforward, and safe.**\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Reasoning:** The code is purely structural, with no external interactions, no dynamic code, no secrets, and no suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe supply chain security risk for this code is negligible. It is a standard exception class hierarchy for a messaging framework, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
