{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for a FastStream messaging framework, including mechanisms for stopping, acknowledging, rejecting messages, and handling validation errors.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes and constants, no input data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is processed or transmitted within this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs as the code only contains class definitions and constant strings.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious constructs; the code is standard exception class definitions and informational strings.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exceptions for a messaging framework, mainly used for control flow and error handling. The exception classes include mechanisms to skip, acknowledge, negatively acknowledge, or reject messages, as well as to stop the application or handler. No input/output handling, network operations, or data processing occurs. Constants provide instructions for dependency installation. The structure and content are straightforward and align with standard Python practices; no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of standard exception class definitions for a messaging framework. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks. The code appears safe and purely for control flow and error signaling within the application.",
