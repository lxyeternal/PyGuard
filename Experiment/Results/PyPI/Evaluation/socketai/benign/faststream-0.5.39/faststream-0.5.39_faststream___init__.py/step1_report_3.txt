{
  "purpose": "To provide a Python framework for building services that interact with messaging systems like Kafka, RabbitMQ, NATS, and Redis.",
  "sources": "Imports from faststream library modules (annotations, app, broker middlewares, response, testing, utils).",
  "sinks": "None of the imported components appear to be used for executing untrusted data or malicious actions within this snippet.",
  "flows": "No actual data flows or function calls are present in this code snippet; it only imports and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is simply importing and exporting components from a library without executing any logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports various classes and functions from the 'faststream' package and exposes them via __all__. There is no execution, user input handling, network communication, or dynamic code evaluation. The import statements are from a well-known asynchronous messaging framework, and there are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are visible.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a module export list for a Python framework designed for messaging services. It contains no suspicious or malicious activity and appears to be a standard, benign library interface definition.",
