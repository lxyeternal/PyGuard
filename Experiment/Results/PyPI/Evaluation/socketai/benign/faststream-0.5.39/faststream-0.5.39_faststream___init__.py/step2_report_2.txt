  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a module that imports components from the 'faststream' framework and re-exports them via __all__.\n- No data processing, dynamic execution, or input handling is present.\n- No suspicious, obfuscated, or malicious code patterns are identified.\n- The code appears to be a straightforward API surface or module initialization file.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, consisting solely of import/export statements with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n- **Logical or reasoning errors:**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly interpret the code as a benign API setup.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the analysis. Given the code's simplicity, these scores seem appropriate.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  0 — No malicious activity, code execution, or suspicious behavior is evident.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  0 — The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden logic.\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  0 — No data handling, secrets, or vulnerabilities are present.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- The reports assume the code is purely import/export without any hidden malicious intent. Given the simplicity and the context, this is reasonable.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent across reports and match the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a benign module that imports and re-exports components of a messaging framework. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- All reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The code is safe, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concerns.\n- The assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- **Maintain the scores at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk.**  \n- **No further action needed.**",
