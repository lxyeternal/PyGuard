  "purpose": "Define and export components of a Python framework for building messaging services with various brokers like Kafka, RabbitMQ, NATS, and Redis.",
  "sources": "Imports from external modules: faststream.annotations, faststream.app, faststream.broker.middlewares, faststream.broker.response, faststream.testing.app, faststream.utils.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or malicious actions. The code only performs import statements and defines __all__.",
  "flows": "Imports are straightforward; no data flows from sources to sinks within this code snippet. No runtime data processing occurs here.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a typical module defining public API exports. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present. No malicious code is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely imports and re-exports specific components from the 'faststream' package. It acts as an API surface for other modules to use these components. No user input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no external data processing are evident. The imports are from well-defined modules related to messaging frameworks. No suspicious or malicious patterns such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard API export file for a Python messaging framework. It contains no malicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious patterns. It poses no security risk.",
