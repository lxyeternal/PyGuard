  "purpose": "This code provides an interface for building streaming services that interact with message brokers like Kafka, RabbitMQ, NATS, and Redis.",
  "sources": "Import statements from faststream modules, importing classes and functions such as ContextRepo, Logger, NoCast, FastStream, middleware classes, response, testing app, and utilities.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or potentially dangerous operations are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The code primarily imports modules and re-exports certain classes/functions; no data flows from sources to sinks within this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected. The code is straightforward and consists solely of import and export statements.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various components from the 'faststream' package, which appears to be a framework for building streaming services. There are no functions, data processing, or input/output operations that could be exploited. The code serves as an initial setup or module export, with no dynamic or unsafe behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module that exposes classes and functions for building streaming services. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or security vulnerabilities within this fragment.",
