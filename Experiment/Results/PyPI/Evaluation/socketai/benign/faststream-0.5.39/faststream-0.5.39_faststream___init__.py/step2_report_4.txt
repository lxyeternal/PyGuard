  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code snippet.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is purely import and export statements, with no data processing, dynamic execution, or input handling.\n   - No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign and serves as an API surface for the 'faststream' framework.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and thorough; they correctly identify that the code is straightforward and benign.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are apparent.\n   - They correctly note the absence of data flows, dynamic code, or suspicious constructs.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n   - These scores seem reasonable given the benign analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - No issues warrant a higher risk score since there's no evidence of malicious activity, data leakage, or security flaws.\n   - The code is standard for module export purposes.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's structure and content.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis: all are zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risk identified.\n\n**Overall, the code appears to be a standard, benign module that exports components of the 'faststream' framework.** There are no signs of security issues, malicious intent, or obfuscation.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is safe, with no need for further security concern. It functions as a simple API export module for a messaging framework.",
