{
  "purpose": "The code provides module imports and public API definitions for a Python framework that facilitates building services interacting with messaging systems like Kafka, RabbitMQ, NATS, and Redis.",
  "sources": "The code reads import statements, specifically from faststream and its submodules.",
  "targets": "There are no data sinks or untrusted data handling in this code; it primarily sets up exports and imports.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks is present; this code only imports and defines __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical Python module structure.",
  "analysis": "The script imports several components from the 'faststream' library, indicating it is part of a larger framework for message-driven services. There are no dynamic code execution, user inputs, or data processing logic. The __all__ list defines the module's public API. No suspicious or malicious patterns, such as obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior, are evident. The code appears to be a standard module initialization or API exposure file, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup for a Python framework, solely defining imports and exports. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation. It appears safe and intended for normal use within the framework.",
