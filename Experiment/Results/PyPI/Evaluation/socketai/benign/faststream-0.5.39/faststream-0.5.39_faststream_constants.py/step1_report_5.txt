  "purpose": "Define a string alias for content type and an enumeration for specific content types.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; only class definitions and constants.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data processing or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only defines types and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a string alias 'ContentType' and an Enum 'ContentTypes' with two content type strings. There are no data inputs, no data flows, and no security-critical operations. The usage of Enum subclassing str is standard and safe. No malicious patterns or anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It merely defines constants for content types with no suspicious or dangerous code.",
