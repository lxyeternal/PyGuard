  "purpose": "Defines content type constants and an enumeration for MIME types.",
  "sources": "Import of Enum, class attribute definitions",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output or untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "None; static constants and enum definitions only",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward, standard implementation with no suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports Enum, defines a string alias, and creates an Enum class with two MIME type strings. It contains no data flows, input handling, or dynamic code execution. No anomalies, secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present. The code is simple, benign, and serves as a constants module. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with full confidence. The scores are justified given the code's straightforwardness and lack of security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward definition of content type constants using Python enums. There is no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risk. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
