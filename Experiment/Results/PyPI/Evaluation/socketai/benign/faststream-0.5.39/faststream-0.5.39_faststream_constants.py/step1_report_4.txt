  "purpose": "Define a class for content types with string enumeration values",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading occurs in this code",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output occurs in this code",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks since no data handling occurs",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, secrets, or unusual behavior present; class and enum usage is standard",
  "analysis": "The code imports Enum, defines a type alias ContentType as string, and creates an Enum class ContentTypes with two string members representing content types. No input handling, data leakage, or malicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward and typical for defining constants.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign definition of content type constants using Enum. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
