{
  "purpose": "Define a string alias and an enumeration for content types used in data handling or HTTP responses.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or potential data leak points are present in the code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from source to sink since the code only defines constants and a class.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward; no unusual patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Enum from the enum module, defines a string alias ContentType, and creates an Enum class ContentTypes with two content type strings. All elements are standard Python constructs used for defining constants and enums. No external data input, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard definition of content type constants using Python enums. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
