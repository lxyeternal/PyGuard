  "purpose": "Define a string type alias and an enumeration for content types.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data is being written or sent to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow or data processing occurs within the code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and uses standard Python features. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Enum from the enum module and creates a type alias 'ContentType' for str. It then defines a class 'ContentTypes' inheriting from str and Enum, with two members representing common MIME types. The implementation is standard, with clear purpose, no dynamic code execution, no user input handling, and no malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign enumeration and type alias definition with no malicious behavior or security concerns.",
