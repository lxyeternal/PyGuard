  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward definition of constants and an enum for content types.\n- No external inputs, data flows, or sinks are present.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are detected.\n- The code is standard, benign, and serves as a simple configuration or constants module.\n\n**Code confirmation:**\n- The code indeed only imports Enum, defines a string alias `ContentType`, and creates an Enum class `ContentTypes` with two MIME type strings.\n- No malicious behavior, data leakage, or security concerns are evident.\n\n**Score review:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- Confidence is 1 across all reports, which is appropriate given the straightforwardness.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n- No issues are present in the code; all reports correctly identify the benign nature.\n- The reasoning in each report is consistent and sound.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.\n- There are no indications of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The code is purely a constants/enumeration definition.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n**Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign, standard implementation of content type constants using Python enums. All reports correctly identify this, and no adjustments are necessary.",
