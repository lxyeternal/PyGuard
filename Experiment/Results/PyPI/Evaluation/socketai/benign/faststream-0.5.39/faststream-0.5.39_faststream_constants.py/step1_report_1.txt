{
  "purpose": "Define content type constants and an enumeration for content types.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'Enum' from the 'enum' module and defines string constants and an Enum class.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted inputs to outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it imports Enum and defines a string alias 'ContentType'. It then creates an Enum class 'ContentTypes' with two content type values. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. The code appears to serve as a simple, well-structured configuration or constant definition.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a constants/enumeration definition without any malicious intent or security concerns.",
