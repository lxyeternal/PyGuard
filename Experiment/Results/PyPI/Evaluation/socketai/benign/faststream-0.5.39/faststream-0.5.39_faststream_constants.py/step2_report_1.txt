  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward definition of constants and an enumeration for content types.\n- There are no data flows, input handling, or output operations.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are detected.\n- The code is simple, standard, and benign.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- **Presence of issues:** None of the reports find any issues with the code; all agree it's benign.\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning:** No errors are apparent; all reports correctly interpret the code.\n- **Scores assigned:**\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.\n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate, as there's no malicious activity.\n  - Security risk: 0 — justified, as the code doesn't introduce any security concerns.\n\n**Potential concerns:**\n- Since the code is purely defining constants and an enum, there is no reason to assign any risk or malware scores above 0.\n- The \"malware\" score is correctly set to 0 across all reports, reflecting no malicious intent.\n- The \"obfuscated\" score is also correctly 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- All reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores are reasonable and justified.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final note:** The code is a benign constants definition, with no security concerns or malicious intent. The current scores are appropriate and should remain as is.",
