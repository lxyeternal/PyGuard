  "purpose": "Defines a version and service name for a messaging framework based microservices.",
  "sources": "Constants defining __version__ and SERVICE_NAME.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted inputs; only static assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed. The use of f-string with a constant is redundant but harmless.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string and constructs a service name using an f-string. Both are static assignments with no dynamic or untrusted data involved. No external data sources, no data processing, no potential injection points. The code does not contain any malware indicators such as data exfiltration, network communication, or hidden backdoors. The use of f-string with a constant value does not introduce security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, purely defining static metadata with no malicious or security-sensitive behavior.",
