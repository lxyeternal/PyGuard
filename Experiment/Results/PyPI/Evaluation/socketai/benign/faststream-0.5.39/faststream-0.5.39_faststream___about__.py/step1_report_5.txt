  "purpose": "Define package metadata and service name for a message broker framework",
  "sources": "The code reads the module-level string __version__ and constructs SERVICE_NAME",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is used in a vulnerable or dangerous way",
  "flows": "The code assigns a string to SERVICE_NAME using __version__",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version string and constructs a service name dynamically. It does not process external input, execute untrusted data, or contain suspicious behavior. The string formatting is straightforward and static. No signs of malware, malicious code, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, benign, and purely defines metadata. There are no malicious behaviors or security risks present.",
