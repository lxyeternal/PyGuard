  "purpose": "Define version and service name for a microservice framework.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of __version__ and use of f-string to construct SERVICE_NAME.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external input processed.",
  "flows": "None; static data assignments only.",
  "anomalies": "Use of f-string with a constant string is redundant but harmless; no other anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string and constructs a service name using an f-string with a constant. There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or dynamic behaviors. The code is straightforward, serving as configuration metadata. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The use of an f-string with a constant does not introduce any vulnerabilities. The code is benign and static.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign configuration snippet with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. All assessments and scores indicating zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and accurate.",
