  "purpose": "Defines a version and a service name for a message broker-based microservices framework.",
  "sources": "Assignment of __version__ string and SERVICE_NAME variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or untrusted input handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; simple variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string and constructs a service name using f-string formatting. There is no input reading, no data processing, and no dynamic code execution. The use of f-string here is straightforward and does not introduce security issues. Overall, this is a basic configuration snippet with no malicious or suspicious components.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple configuration snippet with no malicious intent or security risks. It merely defines versioning and service naming conventions for a framework.",
