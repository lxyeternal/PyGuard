  "sources": "Reading the __version__ variable assignment and SERVICE_NAME concatenation.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data output or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only internal string assignments are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string and constructs a service name string using that version. Both are static assignments with no external input, data processing, or side effects. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be straightforward and harmless, serving as configuration or metadata setup without any malicious intent.",
