{
  "purpose": "Define a framework version and construct a service name based on the version.",
  "sources": "Assignment of string constants (__version__ and SERVICE_NAME).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; simple assignment statements.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The service name concatenates a version string, which is typical.",
  "analysis": "The code only defines a version string and a service name string that incorporates this version. There are no input/output operations, no external data processing, no dynamic code execution, or other suspicious patterns. It appears to be a standard initialization snippet for a framework, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward declaration of constants used for versioning and naming, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
