  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code defines multiple classes for security configurations, mainly for SSL and SASL mechanisms.\n- No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data leaks are present.\n- Credentials are stored as plain attributes, but no hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns are evident.\n- The code appears to be a straightforward, configuration-focused implementation.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n**Purpose:** Standard security configuration classes, no suspicious behavior.\n\n**Analysis:** No anomalies, no data sinks, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 (correct)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- Security Risk: 0 (correct)\n- Confidence: 1 (appropriate)\n\n**Verdict:** Fully reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n**Purpose:** Defines security classes, including placeholders for future secret handling.\n\n**Analysis:** No malicious activity, just configuration classes. The only concern is the note about moving to `SecretStr`, but currently passwords are plain.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 (correct)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- Security Risk: 0.1 (slightly elevated, possibly due to plaintext password storage, but the report explicitly notes this as a minor concern and a future plan, not malicious)\n- Confidence: 1 (appropriate)\n\n**Verdict:** No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n**Purpose:** Similar to above, configuration classes with no external data processing.\n\n**Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, no data leaks, no code execution.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 (correct)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- Security Risk: 0.1 (consistent with plaintext password storage concern)\n- Confidence: 0.9 (slightly less, but still acceptable)\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n**Purpose:** Same pattern, no external data or malicious behavior.\n\n**Analysis:** No network, file, or system modifications. The only minor concern is the placeholder comment about secret handling.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 (correct)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- Security Risk: 0 (no real risk, just configuration)\n- Confidence: 1 (appropriate)\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n**Purpose:** Similar configuration classes, with mention of potential future improvements.\n\n**Analysis:** No malicious activity. Passwords stored in plaintext are noted but not malicious.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 (correct)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- Security Risk: 0.1 (due to plaintext password storage, but explicitly acknowledged as a TODO, not malicious)\n- Confidence: 0.9 (reasonable)\n\n**Verdict:** No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of findings:**\n\n- **Malware score:** consistently 0 across all reports. The code is purely configuration, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** all very low (0 or 0.1), reflecting minimal security concern, mainly about plaintext password storage, which is acknowledged as a TODO.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward, standard implementation of security configuration classes.\n- No malicious activity, no data exfiltration, no network operations, no obfuscation.\n- The minor concern about plaintext passwords is acknowledged and not indicative of malicious intent.\n\n**Therefore, I recommend:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (due to plaintext password storage, but this is a known, non-malicious concern)\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is safe, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The slight security risk score is justified by plaintext password storage, which is acknowledged as a TODO for future improvement but not malicious.\n\n**My final estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the current understanding and the evidence provided.",
