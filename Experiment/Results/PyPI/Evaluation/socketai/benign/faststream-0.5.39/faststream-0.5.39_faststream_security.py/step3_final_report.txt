{
  "purpose": "Defines various security configuration classes for SSL and SASL mechanisms, primarily serving as configuration holders without executing malicious actions.",
  "sources": "Class constructors accepting parameters such as username, password, ssl_context; methods returning static schemas and requirements.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks that could cause leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., username, password) assigned to class attributes; methods returning static data structures; no external data processing or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "Plaintext storage of passwords as class attributes; placeholder comments indicating future plans to migrate to SecretStr; no code obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of security configuration classes with no dynamic code execution, network calls, or data leaks. The only minor concern is plaintext password storage, which is acknowledged via TODO comments and not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are consistent with the code's behavior and potential security considerations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, configuration-focused implementation with no malicious intent or activity. The slight security risk score reflects the plaintext password storage, which is acknowledged and planned for future improvement. The reports' assessments are accurate and appropriate.",
