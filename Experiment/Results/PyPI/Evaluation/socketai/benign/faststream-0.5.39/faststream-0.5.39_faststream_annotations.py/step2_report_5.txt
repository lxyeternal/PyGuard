  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the details:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code sets up type annotations and imports for a FastStream app, with no data flows, sinks, or anomalies.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The code is purely structural.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; security risk is 0. The confidence is high (1).\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent; no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Defines type annotations for dependency injection and context management; no untrusted data or external calls.\n- **Findings:** No malicious patterns, no suspicious behavior, standard practice.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; security risk is 0. Confidence is 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to above, with context-aware annotations, no malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No data leaks, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; security risk is 0. Confidence 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Type annotations and imports for framework setup, no data processing or external communication.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; security risk is 0. Confidence 1.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Framework setup, dependency injection, no malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No data leaks, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; security risk is 0. Confidence 1.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity; scores are 0, which is justified.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; scores are 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Since the code is purely structural, dependency setup, and does not process or transmit data, the risk scores are appropriately low (0).\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores across all reports are consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments needed.\n- The code appears entirely benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, standard setup code for dependency injection and context management within a FastStream application, with no security concerns.",
