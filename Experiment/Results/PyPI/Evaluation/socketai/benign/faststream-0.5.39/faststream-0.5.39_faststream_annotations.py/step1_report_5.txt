{
  "purpose": "The code defines type annotations and imports modules related to a framework called faststream, primarily for setting up context-aware logging and application components.",
  "sources": "Imports modules: logging, typing, typing_extensions, faststream.app, faststream.utils.context, faststream.utils.no_cast",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks detected; no external network or sensitive data handling is present",
  "flows": "Imports and type annotations establish framework components but do not process untrusted input or data flow",
  "anomalies": "Use of Annotated with context objects appears to be a way to inject runtime context, but no suspicious behavior is evident; no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up type annotations for dependency injection or context management using the faststream framework. No user input, network operations, or data processing occurs here. The imported modules are standard or framework-specific, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscation is present. The annotations suggest a design pattern for context-aware logging and application management. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward setup for a framework-based application, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a configuration/setup snippet for a framework, with no malicious behavior or security issues identified. It uses annotations for dependency injection or context management without any suspicious logic.",
