{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up type annotations and import statements for a FastStream application, likely for dependency injection or type hinting.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library (logging, typing), and application modules (faststream.app, faststream.utils). No user input or external data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or transmitted. The code does not include network communication, file I/O, or system commands.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks, as the code only defines type annotations and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. The use of Annotated types for dependency injection or type hinting is standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements and type annotations using the Annotated construct. It imports modules related to logging and application-specific utilities. The annotated variables seem intended for dependency injection or runtime context management. There is no executable logic, data processing, or network activity. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are present. The structure and content are consistent with typical setup code for a FastStream application.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for dependency injection and type hinting within a FastStream application. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears safe and does not introduce any vulnerabilities.",
