  "purpose": "Define type annotations with context metadata for a FastStream application.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules and type variables, and the creation of annotated type aliases.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Imports and type alias definitions without data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Annotated types with context metadata; no suspicious or malicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines annotated type aliases for logging, context, no-cast utility, and FastStream application. The annotations seem intended for dependency injection or contextual typing, not for malicious behavior. No data flows or user input processing are evident. There are no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, or malicious patterns. The code appears to be structural setup code for type safety or dependency injection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup for type annotations with context, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a foundation for a larger application framework and does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior.",
