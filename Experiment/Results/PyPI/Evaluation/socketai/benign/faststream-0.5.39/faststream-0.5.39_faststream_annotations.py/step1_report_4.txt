{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations with contextual metadata for a FastStream application setup.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library (logging, typing), third-party modules (typing_extensions), and application modules (faststream.app, faststream.utils).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present that process untrusted data; the code primarily sets up type annotations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is primarily declarative with type annotations and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. Usage of type annotations with Context metadata is standard for structured code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party modules, defines type variables, and creates annotated type aliases with contextual metadata. There are no indications of data leakage, malicious behavior, or malicious intent. The annotations help with dependency injection or structured type checking but do not perform any data manipulation or network activity. No suspicious or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup of type annotations with contextual metadata for a FastStream application. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are apparent.",
