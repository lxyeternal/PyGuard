  "purpose": "Setup of type annotations and dependency injection points for a FastStream application, facilitating context management and type safety.",
  "sources": "Import statements, TypeVar definition, Annotated type alias declarations using Context and NoCast.",
  "sinks": "None; code does not process untrusted input or data flows.",
  "flows": "N/A; no runtime data flow or external communication present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard for dependency setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party modules, defines a generic type variable, and creates annotated type aliases with Context and NoCast. There is no executable logic, data processing, or external communication. The annotations are used for dependency injection or context-aware behavior within the framework. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The code is purely structural, serving as setup for a larger application.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard setup code for dependency injection and type annotations within a FastStream application. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening patterns are present. All signals indicate a safe, straightforward configuration.",
