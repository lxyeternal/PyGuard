  "purpose": "Manage and run the QtAsyncio event loop, integrating asyncio with Qt application lifecycle.",
  "sources": "Reads input coroutine, global asyncio event loop, and asyncio policies.",
  "sinks": "Potential global policy change affecting asyncio's behavior, but no direct data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Sets custom asyncio policy -> runs coroutine or event loop -> restores original policy.",
  "anomalies": "Temporary override of asyncio's global event loop policy, which could impact other asyncio components if misused.",
  "analysis": "The code manipulates asyncio's global event loop policy to integrate with Qt, then restores it after execution. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The policy change is standard for Qt-asyncio integration but could have side effects on other asyncio components. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration observed. The logic is straightforward and uses standard Python asyncio patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for integrating asyncio with Qt applications. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The only concern is the temporary change to the global asyncio policy, which is a common pattern but could affect other asyncio operations. Overall, the code is safe, and the security risk is minimal.",
