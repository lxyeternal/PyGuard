  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Assessment:** The code is a standard asyncio utility for Qt integration, managing event loop policies, and coroutine execution. No malicious activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0.5 (possibly slightly high but justified given the policy switching, though it’s a common pattern).  \n- **Justification:** The policy change is standard for Qt integration, not malicious. The risk score could be lowered to 0.1, but given the policy override, a cautious 0.5 is acceptable.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, the code manages asyncio event loop policies for Qt, executes coroutines, and restores policies. No suspicious behavior or malicious code.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0.1.  \n- **Justification:** The minimal risk reflects the standard pattern; no malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Assessment:** Again, the code handles asyncio and Qt integration, with no signs of malicious activity. Slightly higher security risk score (0.1) possibly due to the global policy change, but still within reasonable bounds.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0.1.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious intent observed; the risk score seems appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar pattern; no suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The risk score of 0.1 is consistent.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0.1.  \n- **Justification:** Standard asyncio-Qt integration code, safe.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Assessment:** Same as above, standard event loop management with no malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0.  \n- **Justification:** No suspicious activity; the security risk could be set to 0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity. The code is a typical asyncio utility for Qt integration, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or data exfiltration.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is clear, well-structured, and uses standard Python patterns. No obfuscation is evident.  \n- **Risk Score:** The main concern is the temporary override of asyncio's event loop policy, which could affect global state, but this is a common pattern in Qt-asyncio integrations and not inherently malicious. A risk score of 0.1 to 0.2 is appropriate.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (minor, due to policy switching, but standard practice)\n\n**Summary:** The code is legitimate, safe, and intended for Qt-asyncio integration. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The current scores are reasonable, but I would suggest lowering the security risk score to 0.1 for more accuracy.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Security Risk |\n|---------|--------------|---------------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.1           |\n\nThis reflects a benign, well-structured utility with minimal security considerations.",
