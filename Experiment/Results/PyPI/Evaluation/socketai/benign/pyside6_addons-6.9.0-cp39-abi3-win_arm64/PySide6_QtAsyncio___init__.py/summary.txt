  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for integrating asyncio with Qt applications. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The only concern is the temporary change to the global asyncio policy, which is a common pattern but could affect other asyncio operations. Overall, the code is safe, and the security risk is minimal."
