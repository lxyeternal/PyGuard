{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to define versioning information for a software package and output it in a specific format, likely for use by CMake during build configuration.",
  "sources": "The code reads version-related variables defined within the script itself.",
  "sinks": "The script outputs the version information via the print() statement; no untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the defined variables to the print() statement, which outputs the version information.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward, contains no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs. No obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious imports are present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines version components as string variables and prints them in a formatted string if executed as the main module. It uses a standard print() function for output. The variables are hardcoded and do not involve any user input, environment variables, or external data sources. The code's structure is simple, readable, and adheres to typical versioning scripts. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign version information generator, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It serves a standard purpose in software build processes.",
