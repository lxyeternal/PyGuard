  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the original code carefully.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It defines static version components as string constants.\n- When run as a script, it outputs these components in a specific format via `print()`.\n- There are no user inputs, external data, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation.\n- The code's purpose appears to be to provide version info for build systems like CMake.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  The reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward, static, and benign. No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- **In the reports:**  \n  No errors or logical flaws are identified. The code is simple and correct for its purpose.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`. This is appropriate; no malicious activity is detected.  \n  **Justification:** The code only outputs static version info; no malware behaviors are present.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`. Correct, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`. Correct, no security issues are evident.\n\n- **Purpose and reasoning:**  \n  The reports correctly interpret the code's purpose and find no anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n\n### Critical Observations:\n- The code is a standard version info generator, commonly used in build systems.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are justified here.\n- The scores are consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on the detailed review, I agree with the reports' conclusions and scores.**\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a benign, static version info provider with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No further action needed.",
