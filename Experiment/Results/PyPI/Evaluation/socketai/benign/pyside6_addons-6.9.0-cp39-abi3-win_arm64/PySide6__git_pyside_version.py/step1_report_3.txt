  "purpose": "Define and output version information for a software package, used by build tools like CMake.",
  "sources": "Constant variable assignments and the print statement in the main block.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs version info; no untrusted input handling or external data sources present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; static data is printed directly.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. The code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns static string values to version variables and prints them when executed as a script. It is standard version info handling with no dynamic input, external data, or malicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. The structure and content are simple, indicating purpose alignment with version management. No anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version info script with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate component for version management in build processes.",
