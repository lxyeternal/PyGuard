{
  "purpose": "The code defines version information for a software package and outputs it in a specific format when executed as a script.",
  "sources": "Reads version information variables and the '__name__' special variable.",
  "sinks": "Outputs version data via print statement; no untrusted data or external data sources are used.",
  "flows": "Variables are set at the beginning, and the print statement outputs concatenated version info when run as a script.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily sets version variables and outputs them in a formatted string. There are no external inputs, no data leaks, no dynamic code execution, and no malicious or suspicious behavior. The only operation is printing version info, which is static and controlled. No malware behaviors such as network activity, data theft, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple version information script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It serves a legitimate purpose of providing version metadata for a software build process.",
