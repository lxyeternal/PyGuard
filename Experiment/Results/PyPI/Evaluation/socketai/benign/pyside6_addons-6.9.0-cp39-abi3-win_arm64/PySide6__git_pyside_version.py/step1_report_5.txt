{
  "purpose": "The code defines version information for a software package and prints it in a specific format when executed as a script.",
  "sources": "The version variables (major_version, minor_version, patch_version, release_version_type, pre_release_version) are assigned static string values within the code.",
  "sinks": "The only output is a formatted string printed to standard output when executed as a script.",
  "flows": "The variables are combined into a formatted string and printed; no untrusted data sources or external input are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and uses static assignments and simple output.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes version information variables with fixed string values, including optional release type and pre-release identifiers. It then outputs these values in a semicolon-separated format when run as the main module. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious operations. The code appears to serve as a simple version information provider for build or CMake integration purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious behavior. It simply stores version data and outputs it when executed. There are no security risks, malicious activities, or anomalies detected.",
