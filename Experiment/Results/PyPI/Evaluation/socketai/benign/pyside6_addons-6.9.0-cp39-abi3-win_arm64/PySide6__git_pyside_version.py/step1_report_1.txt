{
  "purpose": "Define and output version information for a software package, likely used by build systems like CMake.",
  "sources": "Constants defining version parts (major_version, minor_version, patch_version, release_version_type, pre_release_version).",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs version information, which could potentially be used by external systems, but no sensitive data or untrusted input is involved.",
  "flows": "Constants are assigned fixed string values and then concatenated into a version string that is printed to standard output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. No use of untrusted input, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious behaviors. The code is straightforward and solely outputs predefined version info.",
  "analysis": "The script defines version-related variables and prints them in a specific format for build or packaging purposes. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The purpose appears to be version management. No malicious or suspicious code patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version info generator for build systems, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
