{
  "purpose": "The code defines static version components and outputs them, serving as a version info generator for build systems.",
  "sources": "Static string variables for version components; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs version info; no untrusted data handling or data leaks involved.",
  "flows": "Static variables assigned; output via print; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and free of suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple static version info generator with no dynamic input, external data, or malicious behavior. It does not perform any network activity, code injection, or obfuscation. The purpose is clear and benign. All reports correctly identify the code as non-malicious, with scores reflecting zero malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The confidence scores are high, and the logic is consistent. No signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and serves a common purpose in build systems. All assessments and scores are appropriate and justified. No security concerns or malicious behavior are detected.",
