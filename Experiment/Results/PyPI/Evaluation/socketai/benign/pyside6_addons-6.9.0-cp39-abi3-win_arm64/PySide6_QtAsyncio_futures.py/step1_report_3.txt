  "purpose": "Implementation of a custom asyncio Future-like class for asynchronous programming, managing future states, callbacks, and exception handling.",
  "sources": "Imports asyncio, contextvars, enum; accesses asyncio's event loop; reads attributes of self (state, result, exception, callbacks); calls self._loop.call_soon() for callbacks.",
  "sinks": "Calls to self._loop.call_soon() for executing callbacks; raising exceptions like asyncio.CancelledError, asyncio.InvalidStateError; methods that may raise exceptions based on state.",
  "flows": "Initialization of future object -> state changes via set_result/set_exception/cancel -> callbacks scheduled via _schedule_callbacks -> callback invocation via call_soon.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. The code strictly implements expected asyncio Future behaviors. No suspicious code patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom Future class that closely mimics asyncio's Future. It manages states, allows adding/removing callbacks, and handles cancellation and exceptions appropriately. It interacts with the event loop only through well-defined asyncio calls. No external data sources, user input, or network operations are present. No indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. No obfuscation or suspicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a future-like construct for asyncio-based asynchronous programming. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code is well-structured and adheres to expected patterns. Overall, it poses no security threat.",
