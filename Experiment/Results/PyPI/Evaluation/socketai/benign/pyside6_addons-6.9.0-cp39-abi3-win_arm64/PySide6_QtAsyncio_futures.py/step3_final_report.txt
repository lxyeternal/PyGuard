{
  "purpose": "A custom asyncio-compatible Future class managing asynchronous task states, callbacks, and exceptions, used for async programming.",
  "sources": "Reads from the event loop, manages internal state, and handles callback registration and invocation.",
  "sinks": "Callback functions executed via the event loop; no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "State transitions trigger callback execution; set_result/set_exception update internal state and invoke callbacks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external data handling detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard asyncio Future pattern with proper state management, callback scheduling, and exception handling. It interacts with the event loop for callback execution. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data leaks are present. The code is clear, readable, and aligns with typical asyncio practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of an asyncio Future-like class with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The assessments in the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
