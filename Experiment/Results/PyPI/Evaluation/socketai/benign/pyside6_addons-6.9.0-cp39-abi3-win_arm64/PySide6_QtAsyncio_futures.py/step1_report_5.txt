{
  "purpose": "Implementation of a custom Future class compatible with asyncio, providing mechanisms for asynchronous result handling, callbacks, and cancellation.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (asyncio, contextvars, enum), class constructor parameters (loop, context), internal methods (set_result, set_exception, cancel), and callback registration methods.",
  "sinks": "Methods that may raise exceptions or handle untrusted input such as 'set_exception', 'cancel', 'add_done_callback', and 'result'.",
  "flows": "Code flow involves setting results or exceptions to the future, registering callbacks, and potentially cancelling the future, which then triggers callback execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors. The code is a standard implementation of asyncio Future with no obfuscated or malicious constructs. It follows expected async patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for managing asynchronous operations, handling states, callbacks, and cancellations in a typical pattern. It imports standard modules and uses typical class structure without hidden or suspicious behavior. No network calls, data leaks, or malicious behaviors detected. The class only manages internal states and callbacks for asyncio futures.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of an asyncio Future-like object with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is a typical part of asynchronous programming and contains no malicious or security-risk elements.",
