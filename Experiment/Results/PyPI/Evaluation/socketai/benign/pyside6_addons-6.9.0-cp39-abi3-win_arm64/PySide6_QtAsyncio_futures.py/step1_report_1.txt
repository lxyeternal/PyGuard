  "purpose": "Implementation of a custom Future-like class compatible with asyncio, managing asynchronous task completion and callbacks.",
  "sources": "Input data may come from method parameters (e.g., set_result, set_exception, cancel), or from internal state changes during asynchronous execution.",
  "sinks": "The class methods that invoke callbacks (_schedule_callbacks) could potentially execute untrusted callback functions provided by external code. Additionally, set_result, set_exception, and cancel methods may indirectly influence callback execution.",
  "flows": "External code or asynchronous events trigger methods like set_result, set_exception, or cancel, which then execute registered callbacks via _schedule_callbacks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Usage of enums and asyncio features appears standard. The class implements callback management and state transitions in a typical manner.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom Future class compatible with asyncio, managing state transitions and callback execution. It relies on asyncio's event loop for scheduling callbacks, and provides mechanisms for setting results, exceptions, or cancellation. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. Callback execution is a standard pattern, with no embedded or suspicious code. The class interfaces with asyncio in a typical manner, with no hardcoded credentials or suspicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a Future-like object for asyncio, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It functions as a component for asynchronous programming and does not include any indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
