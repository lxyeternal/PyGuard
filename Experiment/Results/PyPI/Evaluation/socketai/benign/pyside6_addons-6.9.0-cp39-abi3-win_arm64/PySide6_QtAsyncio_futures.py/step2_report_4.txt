  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it with the code to determine if the assessments are accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states that the code is a standard custom Future implementation compatible with asyncio, managing callbacks and state transitions, with no malicious behavior detected.\n\n- **Scores:** malware 0, securityRisk 0.2, confidence 0.9, obfuscated 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code indeed appears to be a typical asyncio Future-like class, with proper state management, callback scheduling, and exception handling. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code. The security risk score of 0.2 seems slightly conservative but acceptable given the code's nature. The malware score is correctly set to 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is a standard asyncio-compatible Future class with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:** malware 0, securityRisk 0.1, confidence 0.9, obfuscated 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis matches the code. No external data handling, network activity, or suspicious patterns are observed.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is consistent and accurate. Malware score remains at 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard asyncio Future implementation, managing states, callbacks, and exceptions, with no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** malware 0, securityRisk 0, confidence 0.9, obfuscated 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion is justified and aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is a standard asyncio Future-like class, with no external data handling or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** malware 0, securityRisk 0, confidence 1, obfuscated 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. The code is a typical utility class for async programming.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; the scores and conclusions are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, describing a standard implementation with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** malware 0, securityRisk 0.1, confidence 0.9, obfuscated 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is benign, and the assessment matches.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code Presence:** The code is a standard implementation of an asyncio Future-like class, managing asynchronous task completion, callbacks, and exceptions.\n\n- **Malware and Obfuscation:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior across all reports.\n\n- **Security Risk:** The risk scores are low, reflecting the benign nature. The highest is 0.2, which is reasonable.\n\n- **Scores Consistency:** All reports are consistent with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code's purpose and lack of malicious features, a risk score of **0** is appropriate.\n\n- **Overall Malware, Obfuscated, and Risk Scores:**  \n  - **Malware:** 0  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0  \n  - **Risk:** 0\n\nThis reflects a benign, standard implementation of an asyncio-compatible Future class with no security concerns.",
