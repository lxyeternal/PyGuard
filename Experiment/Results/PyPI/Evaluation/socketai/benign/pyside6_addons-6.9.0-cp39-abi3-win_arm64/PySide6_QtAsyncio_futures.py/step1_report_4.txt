{
  "purpose": "Implementation of a custom Future class compatible with asyncio, providing asynchronous task handling and callback mechanisms.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (asyncio, contextvars, enum, typing) and internal module 'events'. No external user input handling or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data; the code does not perform network I/O, file I/O, or system modifications. It mainly manages internal state and callbacks.",
  "flows": "The flow involves creating a Future, setting results or exceptions, scheduling callbacks, and handling cancellation, all within internal state management; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. No dynamic code execution, external data parsing, or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for managing asynchronous operations with proper state management, callback handling, and exception raising. It adheres to asyncio standards and does not include external data handling or network activity. No malicious or suspicious behavior identified, and the logic appears to be a standard implementation of an asyncio-compatible Future class.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign implementation of an asyncio Future object with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. It functions solely as an internal utility for asynchronous programming.",
