{
  "purpose": "Implementation of a custom Future class compatible with asyncio, providing mechanisms for asynchronous task management.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (asyncio, contextvars, enum), class initialization (__init__), methods accessing internal state (_state, _result, _exception, _callbacks, _cancel_message).",
  "sinks": "Methods that may raise exceptions or handle untrusted data include 'set_result', 'set_exception', 'cancel', and 'result'. The code itself does not process untrusted external data or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Internal flow involves setting or retrieving state and callbacks; no external untrusted data flows into critical sinks such as network, filesystem, or environment variables.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code follows standard asyncio Future pattern without hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a custom Future class aligned with asyncio's future protocol, managing task states, callbacks, and exception handling. No external data inputs or network interactions are present. The class methods are standard, with no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data leakage. It appears to be a standard utility class for asynchronous programming, with no anomalies or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of an asyncio-compatible Future class without malicious intent or security risks. It manages asynchronous task states, callbacks, and exceptions safely and predictably. There are no signs of malware, data leakage, or sabotage.",
