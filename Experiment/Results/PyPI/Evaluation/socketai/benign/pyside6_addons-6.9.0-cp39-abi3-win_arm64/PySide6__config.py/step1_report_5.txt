  "purpose": "Define a list of module names and set version-related variables for a Python package, likely for configuration or setup purposes.",
  "sources": "String containing semicolon-separated module names, string literals for version and date variables.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; no input/output or network operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; simple variable assignments and list comprehension.",
  "anomalies": "The build date is set to a future date (2025), which may be unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a list of module names, assigns version info and build date strings. All operations are straightforward, static data assignments. No signs of malicious code, external data handling, or suspicious logic. The future build date could be unusual but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard package metadata configuration with no malicious behavior detected. No security risks or malware indicators present.",
