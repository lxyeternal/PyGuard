{
  "purpose": "Define a list of module names and set version-related variables, likely for a Python package or module initialization.",
  "sources": "The source of data is a string literal containing module names separated by semicolons, and string literals for version and build date variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or transmit untrusted data or perform actions with side effects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the string literal of module names into a list comprehension, and version variables are assigned from string literals.",
  "anomalies": "The build date is set to a future date ('2025-03-31'), which may be unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a list of module names by splitting a string literal, which is standard practice. The version and build date variables are assigned static string values, with the build date notably set in the future. No input from external sources, no dynamic code execution, and no side-effect-inducing functions are present. The code appears to serve as a configuration or metadata declaration. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward initialization of module names and version information for a Python package. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The only unusual aspect is the future build date, which warrants further context but does not indicate malicious intent.",
