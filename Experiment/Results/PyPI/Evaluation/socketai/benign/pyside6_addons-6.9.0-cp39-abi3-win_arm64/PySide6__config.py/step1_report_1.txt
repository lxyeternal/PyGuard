{
  "purpose": "Define a list of Qt module names and set version-related variables for a Python package or build configuration.",
  "sources": "The string containing module names split by semicolons, and string literals assigned to version variables.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or untrusted data flows detected; all data is statically defined.",
  "flows": "The list comprehension creates a list from static string data; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures are present. All code appears standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a list of module names by splitting a static string; assigns version information as static strings. No dynamic execution, no input reading, no external network communication. The variables are typical for package configuration. No obfuscated or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward static configuration snippet for a Python package or Qt build, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
