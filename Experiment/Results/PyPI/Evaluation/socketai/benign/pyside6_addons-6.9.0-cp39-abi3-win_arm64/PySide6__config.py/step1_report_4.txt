{
  "purpose": "Define a list of module names for a Python package related to Qt or PySide, and set version-related variables.",
  "sources": "The list of module names created from a string split; version and build date variables defined as strings and tuples.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no external data sinks or untrusted data handling points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the string of module names into a list; version variables are assigned static values with no external input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a list of module names from a static string, assigns version info and build date as constants. All data is static and hardcoded. No input/output operations, network calls, or suspicious behaviors observed. The build date is set in the future (2025), but that alone is not malicious. No malicious or malicious-looking code, no obfuscation, and no data leaks or security risks identified.",
  "conclusion": "This appears to be standard package setup code defining module names and version info with no malicious intent or security risks.",
