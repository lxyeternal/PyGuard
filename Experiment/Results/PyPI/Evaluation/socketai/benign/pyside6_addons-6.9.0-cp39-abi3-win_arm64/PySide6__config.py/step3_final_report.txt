  "purpose": "Static configuration of module names and version/build date variables for a Python package.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string of module names, static version variables, and build date string.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or external inputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static data remains unchanged.",
  "anomalies": "Build date set to a future date ('2025-03-31'), which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static configuration snippet defining module names and version info. No dynamic code, external data, or network activity is present. The only anomaly is the future build date, which may be a placeholder or misconfiguration but does not indicate malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores at 0. The scores are consistent with the static, non-malicious nature of the code. The future date is noteworthy but not a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static configuration with no malicious behavior or security risks. The future build date is unusual but not indicative of malicious activity. The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are justified and appropriate.",
