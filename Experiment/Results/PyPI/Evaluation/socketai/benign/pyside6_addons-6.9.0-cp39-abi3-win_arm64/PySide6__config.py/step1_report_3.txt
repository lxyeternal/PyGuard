{
  "purpose": "Define a list of built-in module names and set version-related variables for a software package.",
  "sources": "String literals containing module names and version strings; the __build_date__ variable containing a date.",
  "sinks": "None of the data appears to be sent over the network, written to files, or used in unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "The code constructs a list from a string and assigns version variables; no flow of untrusted input to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code detected. __build_date__ is set to a future date (2025), which may be inconsistent with current date but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a list of module names by splitting a semicolon-separated string, which appears to be a static, hardcoded list. Version variables and build date are set explicitly with static values. No input/output operations, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. The __build_date__ is set to a future date, potentially indicating an error or placeholder but not malicious. Overall, the code is straightforward and typical for package setup or configuration files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a static configuration or metadata setup for a software package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activity.",
