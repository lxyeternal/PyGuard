  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet and the provided assessments.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is static, straightforward, and involves defining a list of module names and setting version/build date variables.\n- The only notable anomaly is the build date set in the future ('2025-03-31'), which is unusual but not inherently malicious.\n- No external data flows, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The malware score remains at 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n\n- **Code presence:** The code snippet is indeed present in the context, and all reported variables and logic match.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks is found.\n- **Build date anomaly:** The future date is likely a placeholder or misconfiguration but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- **Malware score:** Consistently 0, which is appropriate given the static, benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, matching the clear, readable code.\n- **Security risk:** 0, as there's no indication of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n- **Build date in 2025:** Unusual but not malicious; could be a placeholder or a future release date.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned in the reports seem reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n- The only potential adjustment might be to note the future build date as a minor anomaly but not to elevate risk scores.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a simple static configuration snippet with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign, static, and typical for package setup. The future build date is unusual but not indicative of malicious activity. The scores are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThis code poses no security risk, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The reported scores are justified.",
