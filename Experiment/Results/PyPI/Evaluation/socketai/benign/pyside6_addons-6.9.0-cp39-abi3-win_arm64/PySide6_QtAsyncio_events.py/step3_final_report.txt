  "purpose": "Implement a custom asyncio event loop policy and event loop for integrating asyncio with PySide6/Qt, managing application lifecycle, threading, and callback scheduling.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, application signals, class constructors, callback functions, timers, threading constructs.",
  "sinks": "Callback execution via QTimer.singleShot, executor submissions, potential callback invocation from user-supplied functions.",
  "flows": "Environment variables/signals → callback scheduling via QTimer or executor → callback execution; no external data exfiltration or malicious network activity.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of NotImplementedError stubs for network and subprocess features; placeholders for incomplete features but no malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured implementation of an asyncio event loop policy and event loop class tailored for Qt integration, utilizing standard Qt constructs (QTimer, QCoreApplication, QThread). It manages application signals, threading, and callback scheduling in a typical manner. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The placeholders indicate incomplete features, not malicious sabotage. The callback mechanisms are standard for event-driven frameworks, with no evidence of malicious data flow or network activity. The code is clear, well-organized, and aligns with common patterns for such integrations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured integration layer for asyncio and Qt, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The low risk score reflects standard application concerns, primarily related to callback execution potential, but nothing malicious is present.",
