      "conclusion": "The code is legitimate setup code for PySide6, performing environment configuration and module discovery without malicious intent. The low scores for malware and obfuscation are appropriate. The moderate risk score accounts for potential exploitation if environment integrity is compromised, but no malicious activity is evident."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for integrating asyncio with Qt applications. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The only concern is the temporary change to the global asyncio policy, which is a common pattern but could affect other asyncio operations. Overall, the code is safe, and the security risk is minimal."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured extension of asyncio for Qt applications, with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data leaks. The use of internal asyncio APIs is documented and not malicious, though it warrants careful maintenance. Traceback storage is for debugging and does not pose a security threat. The overall security assessment is that the code is safe, with malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and a low risk score (~0.2)."

The low risk score reflects standard application concerns, primarily related to callback execution potential, but nothing malicious is present."
