{
  "purpose": "A custom asyncio task class (`QAsyncioTask`) designed for Qt integration, managing coroutine execution, exception handling, and lifecycle within an event loop.",
  "sources": "Coroutine object (`_coro`), internal asyncio APIs (`_register_task`, `_leave_task`, `_unregister_task`), exception traceback storage.",
  "sinks": "Traceback information stored internally; no external data leaks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Coroutine execution flow, exception handling flow, internal API calls for task registration and cleanup.",
  "anomalies": "Use of internal asyncio APIs (_register_task, _leave_task, _unregister_task) which are undocumented extension points; traceback stored for debugging purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a specialized asyncio task for Qt, managing coroutine steps, exception propagation, and cancellation. It uses internal asyncio APIs, which are documented as extension points but are unconventional. Traceback info is stored upon exceptions, serving debugging needs. No external data exfiltration, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The code appears legitimate, with no malicious intent or sabotage. The use of internal APIs introduces minor maintainability risks but not security threats. Traceback storage is standard debugging practice, not malicious. Overall, the code is safe, with low security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured extension of asyncio for Qt applications, with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data leaks. The use of internal asyncio APIs is documented and not malicious, though it warrants careful maintenance. Traceback storage is for debugging and does not pose a security threat. The overall security assessment is that the code is safe, with malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and a low risk score (~0.2).",
