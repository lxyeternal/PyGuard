  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured extension of asyncio for Qt applications, with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data leaks. The use of internal asyncio APIs is documented and not malicious, though it warrants careful maintenance. Traceback storage is for debugging and does not pose a security threat. The overall security assessment is that the code is safe, with malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and a low risk score (~0.2)."
