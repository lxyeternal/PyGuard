  "purpose": "Load configuration files from specified paths, merge their contents hierarchically, and provide access to configuration data.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'ENVIRONMENT' for filename determination; configuration files located at given paths.",
  "sinks": "Reading configuration files via open() and yaml.safe_load(), returning configuration data.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'ENVIRONMENT' influences filename; files are read and parsed; configurations are merged hierarchically.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard safe practices used; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard configuration loader that reads environment variables, searches for YAML files, loads them securely with yaml.safe_load(), and merges configurations hierarchically. It handles missing files and environment variables properly, with no network activity, code injection, or obfuscation. The use of yaml.safe_load() prevents code execution vulnerabilities. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The environment variable 'ENVIRONMENT' is only used for filename selection and is validated for existence. The code structure is clear and well-implemented.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, straightforward configuration loader with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or high security risk. The environment variable usage is standard and does not introduce vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), which is appropriate given the context.",
