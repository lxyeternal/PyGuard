{
  "purpose": "This code provides an interface to load and manage hierarchical YAML configuration files based on environment variables.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'ENVIRONMENT', reads YAML configuration files from specified paths, and reads file contents.",
  "sinks": "Uses yaml.safe_load to parse YAML files, and open() to read files.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'ENVIRONMENT' influences filename; configuration files are read and merged into a single dictionary; configurations are retrieved via get_config.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; no dynamic code execution or network activity; proper use of safe YAML parsing; no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code securely reads environment variables and configuration files, merging nested configurations carefully. It uses safe YAML parsing and does not execute code dynamically or access network resources. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage are present. The code's structure is standard for configuration management.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard configuration loader with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It securely handles file reading and configuration merging without apparent security risks.",
