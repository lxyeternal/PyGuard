{
  "purpose": "The code provides an interface to load, search, and retrieve configuration data from YAML files located in specified paths, using environment variables to determine the configuration file naming.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'ENVIRONMENT', reads YAML configuration files from given paths, and loads their contents.",
  "sinks": "Uses loaded configuration data internally; no data is written to external sources or transmitted over network, and no untrusted input is directly executed.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'ENVIRONMENT' influences file naming; configuration files are searched and read; their contents are deeply merged into a configs dictionary; specific configuration values can be retrieved by key.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns identified. The code relies on environment variables and file I/O in a standard manner. No suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation is present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment variable access, file system checks, and YAML parsing—all typical for configuration management. The '_deep_update' method safely merges dictionaries without executing external code. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The use of 'yaml.safe_load' mitigates injection risks. The code structure appears standard and does not exhibit obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate configuration loader with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It securely reads configuration files based on environment settings and merges their contents. No malicious or suspicious code patterns are detected.",
