  "anomalies": [
    "No hardcoded credentials or secrets observed.",
    "No network operations or external data transmission present.",
    "No obfuscated code or unusual language features.",
    "Use of safe YAML parsing with yaml.safe_load.",
    "No suspicious dynamic code execution or command execution."
  ],
  "analysis": "The code reads environment variables and configuration files securely and only processes data locally. It uses standard libraries for file I/O, environment variable access, and YAML parsing with safety considerations (yaml.safe_load). There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The configuration management approach appears standard and safe. No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious logic is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward configuration loader with no evident malicious intent or security issues. It securely reads environment variables and configuration files, merges configurations safely, and provides access to configuration data. There are no signs of malware or malicious behavior.",
