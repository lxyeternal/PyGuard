  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a configuration loader that reads environment variables, searches for YAML files, loads them securely with `yaml.safe_load()`, merges configurations, and provides access via `get_config()`.\n- No report detects any suspicious or malicious behavior such as network activity, code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n- The code uses standard libraries and safe practices.\n- The environment variable `ENVIRONMENT` is used solely for filename determination, with proper error handling if missing.\n- The YAML files are loaded safely, and merging is done via `_deep_update`, which is a standard recursive dictionary merge.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n\n- The code does **not** contain hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code.\n- No external network or system modification operations are present.\n- No suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation is evident.\n- The YAML parsing uses `yaml.safe_load()`, which is secure against code injection.\n\n**Scores and reasoning:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign a 0, which aligns with the analysis—no malicious behavior is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate given the code clarity.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly above zero (0.1 to 0.2) in some reports, reflecting minimal risk due to reliance on environment variables and file I/O, but nothing dangerous.\n\n**Potential issues or points of critique:**\n\n- The only minor concern is that the environment variable `ENVIRONMENT` is only checked for existence but not validated for expected values. However, this does not constitute a security risk in this context.\n- The code's logic and flow are straightforward, with no signs of hidden malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.\n- No changes needed in scoring or reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity or payloads detected.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear, straightforward, and well-structured.\n\n**Risk score:** **0.1** — minimal risk due to reliance on environment variables and file I/O, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n\n**Final note:** The code appears to be a standard, safe configuration loader suitable for supply chain deployment, with no evident security issues or malicious intent.",
