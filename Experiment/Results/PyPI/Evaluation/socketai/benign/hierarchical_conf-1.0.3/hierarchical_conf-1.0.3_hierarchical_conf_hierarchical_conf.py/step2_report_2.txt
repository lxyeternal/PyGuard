  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code and the provided details.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code reads environment variables, searches for YAML configuration files in specified paths, loads and merges them, and provides access to configuration data.\n- All reports agree that the code uses safe practices: `yaml.safe_load()`, proper exception handling, and no suspicious code patterns.\n- No network activity, external data transmission, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The environment variable `ENVIRONMENT` influences filename selection but is only validated for existence, not content.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** No malicious behavior, straightforward configuration loader, no signs of malware.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies the code as safe, standard, and non-malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, consistent, and reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, notes standard practices, safe YAML parsing, and no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Analysis:** Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.2) perhaps reflecting the reliance on environment variables that could be manipulated, but no actual vulnerabilities are present.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is cautious but justified; no malware detected.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable and aligned with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, confirms safe practices, no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Analysis:** Consistent with previous reports, with a slightly higher securityRisk score due to environment variable dependency.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Same positive assessment, no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Analysis:** Slightly lower securityRisk score, indicating high confidence in safety.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as others, standard configuration loader, no malicious signs.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Analysis:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variations (0.1 to 0.2) reflect cautious but justified assessments due to reliance on environment variables, which could be manipulated in a supply chain context, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code and analysis.\n- No changes needed; the assessments are appropriate.\n- The code appears secure, with no signs of supply chain compromise or malware.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, primarily due to environment variable dependency, which is standard but can be a vector if environment variables are compromised)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, secure configuration loader with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The provided reports' scores are reasonable and justified.",
