{
  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for a Python package called 'hierarchical_conf'.",
  "sources": "Reading files: README.md, requirements.txt, requirements.test.txt; variable assignments; find_packages call.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or external command execution; setup parameters are static or from files.",
  "flows": "Reading files (README.md, requirements files) and passing data to setup() parameters without any processing that could introduce malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hidden code, or dynamic execution observed. The code primarily reads static files and sets up package metadata.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup procedures: reading static files, defining package metadata, and configuring install requirements. There are no dynamic code executions, no network operations, nor any handling of untrusted input data that could lead to malicious activity. All file reads are from local files, and the setup configuration appears normal and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and does not pose security risks.",
