{
  "purpose": "The code is used for setting up a Python package called 'hierarchical_conf' including reading dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md', 'requirements.txt', and 'requirements.test.txt' files for package description and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None present. No untrusted data flows to sensitive functions or external systems.",
  "flows": "File contents are read and stored in variables, then used in setup configuration; no untrusted data flows to insecure functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior. The code uses standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script performs straightforward file reading for package description and dependencies, then configures setup parameters. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. No external network connections, eval calls, or dynamic code execution are detected. The code appears to be a typical setup script for a Python package, with proper use of package discovery and dependency management.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It performs common tasks for package configuration without any suspicious or harmful elements.",
