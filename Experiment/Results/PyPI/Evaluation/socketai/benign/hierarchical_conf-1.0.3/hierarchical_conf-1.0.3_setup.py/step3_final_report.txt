  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging the 'hierarchical_conf' module, reading static files for description and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md', 'requirements.txt', 'requirements.test.txt' files from local filesystem.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, dynamic code execution, or external data processing.",
  "flows": "Static file reads without data flow to untrusted or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script utilizing setuptools, with static file reads for package metadata. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or untrusted input handling. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores as zero or near-zero. The code's simplicity and adherence to standard packaging practices indicate no malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All assessments are accurate and consistent. No adjustments to scores are necessary.",
