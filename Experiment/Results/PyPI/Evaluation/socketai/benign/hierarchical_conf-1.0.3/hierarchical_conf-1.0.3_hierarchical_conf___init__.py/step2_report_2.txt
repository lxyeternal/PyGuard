  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Code:**\n   - All reports indicate that the code snippet is solely a comment (docstring) describing the package purpose.\n   - There are no executable statements, data flows, input/output operations, or any embedded code that could be malicious.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are observed.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly identify that the code is just a descriptive comment with no security implications.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the reasoning. The conclusion that the code is benign is appropriate.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are reasonable given the content.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Malware:**\n   - Since the code is only a comment, the malware score should be 0.\n   - The risk score should also be 0, as there are no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n\n5. **Challenging Assumptions:**\n   - The reports assume that only the visible code snippet is relevant. If there were hidden code elsewhere, that could change the assessment, but based solely on this snippet, the conclusions are valid.\n   - No assumptions about potential future code are necessary; the current code is benign.\n\n6. **Overall Evaluation:**\n   - The reports are accurate and consistent.\n   - The scores are appropriate given the minimal content.\n   - No changes are necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code snippet is harmless, containing only a descriptive comment. No security issues are present.",
