  "purpose": "Define enums and utility functions for image processing parameters and data keys used in the Kornia library.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard and third-party libraries (logging, enum, typing, torch, kornia.core)",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or external communication",
  "flows": "Enums and functions convert input values (strings, integers, tensors) into internal enum representations",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or hardcoded secrets; logging setup is benign; no obfuscated code or malicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code defines several enum classes with class methods for parsing values from strings, integers, tensors, etc. It uses standard enum practices with no external data sources, network activity, or file I/O. The logging configuration is basic and non-malicious. No hidden or obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code's purpose is straightforward: providing enum types and conversion utilities for image processing parameters. No anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard enumeration and utility module for image processing parameters with no malicious intent or security issues identified. It is safe for use.",
