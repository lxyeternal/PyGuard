  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is primarily defining enums, utility functions, and constants for the Kornia library, with no evident data leaks, network activity, or malicious behaviors.\n- No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are identified.\n- The 'pi' constant is defined as a torch tensor, which is standard in scientific computing.\n- The code does not process untrusted input, perform external communication, or execute dynamic code.\n- Logging setup is basic and non-malicious.\n- The code appears to be a standard, well-structured utility module.\n\n**Specific Points:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious code or payloads are detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign an obfuscated score of 0, confirming no obfuscation is present.\n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign a security risk of 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n\n**Potential Issues or Discrepancies:**\n\n- The only minor point is the use of `torch.tensor` to define `pi`. While not malicious, creating a tensor might have implications if used improperly, but in this context, it's benign.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, all reports correctly identify that the code is a benign utility module with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — No security risks identified.\n\nThe code is safe, standard, and appropriate for its purpose.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe supply chain risk for this dependency is negligible. It is a standard utility module defining enums and helper functions with no security or malicious concerns.",
