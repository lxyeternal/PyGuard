{
  "purpose": "Defines enums, constants, and utility functions for image processing configurations in the Kornia library, facilitating type safety and parameter handling.",
  "sources": "Enum class methods, get functions, and the pi tensor definition.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, external I/O, or network operations present.",
  "flows": "Enum get methods convert input (str, int, tensor) to enum instances; pi tensor is a static constant used in computations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility module defining enums with conversion methods, a mathematical constant, and minimal logging. It does not process external or untrusted data, nor does it perform network or file operations. The enum classes and get methods follow standard patterns for safe type conversions. The pi tensor is a scientific constant, typical in computational code. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. All signals indicate benign, static code intended for internal configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility module with no malicious or security risks. It functions as intended for configuration and type safety within the library, with no indicators of supply chain threats.",
