{
  "purpose": "Define enumerations and utility functions for handling various data types, border types, resampling methods, and data keys used in image processing with Kornia.",
  "sources": "None (the code primarily defines classes and constants; no input sources or data reading are present).",
  "sinks": "None (no code writes or transmits data to external systems, network, or files).",
  "flows": "Not applicable (the code does not implement data flow from sources to sinks).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward, mainly defining enums, helper functions, and constants without suspicious or unusual logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, sets up logging, defines enums with custom get methods, and includes a Pi constant. No user input handling, network communication, or dynamic code execution observed. Enum classes provide type safety and conversion methods. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior evident. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. Overall, the code appears to be a standard library component for image processing utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard enumeration and utility definitions module for image processing. It contains no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. The structure and content are consistent with typical library code intended for type safety and configuration. The overall security risk is negligible.",
