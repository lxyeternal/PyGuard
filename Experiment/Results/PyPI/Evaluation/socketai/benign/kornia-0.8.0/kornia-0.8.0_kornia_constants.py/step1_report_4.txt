{
  "purpose": "Defines enumerations and utility functions for handling data types, resampling methods, border types, and padding in a graphics or image processing library, specifically Kornia.",
  "sources": "Imports from Python standard library (logging, enum, typing), torch, and kornia.core.Tensor.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network transmission, file writing, or command execution observed.",
  "flows": "Input sources include type parameters and enum values, primarily used for internal configurations and data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or suspicious logic found. Logging configuration is benign. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of enum classes with associated helper methods, utility functions for enum conversion, and a global tensor 'pi'. The code primarily provides structured constants and type conversions without any user input or external data handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no network calls, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The presence of 'pi' as a tensor is benign and likely used for calculations. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of enums and utility functions for a graphics processing library. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears safe and well-structured with no malicious intent.",
