  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports describe the code as defining enums, utility functions, and constants for image processing in the Kornia library.\n- They emphasize the absence of suspicious behaviors, external data handling, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n- The code's purpose is configuration and utility, with no network, file I/O, or untrusted input processing.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0, with high confidence (mostly 1.0).\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code matches the description; no anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected; no backdoors, obfuscated code, or malicious logic.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** No evidence of vulnerabilities; the code is static, primarily defining enums and constants.\n- **Potential assumptions:** The reports do not rely on assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n### Scores Analysis:\n- **Malware score:** Consistently 0 across all reports, justified by the absence of malicious patterns.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0, given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The code is standard for a utility module in a library, with no suspicious elements.\n- The 'pi' constant, while using torch.tensor, is typical for scientific computations.\n- The enum classes with get methods are common patterns for type safety and flexibility.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The high confidence and zero scores are appropriate.\n- No modifications are necessary; the reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a benign, standard utility module with no security concerns.",
