{
  "purpose": "This code implements a Tversky loss function for training neural networks in segmentation tasks, providing both a functional implementation and a class wrapper for PyTorch models.",
  "sources": "The code reads input tensors `pred` and `target`, and uses internal functions like `mask_ignore_pixels` and `one_hot` to process these inputs. No external data sources or user inputs are directly read in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write to external systems, send data over networks, or perform any I/O operations. No sink functions are present that could lead to data leakage or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Input tensors `pred` and `target` are processed through softmax, masking, and one-hot encoding. The loss calculations involve tensor operations like multiplication, summation, and division. Data flows from input tensors through these computations to produce a scalar loss value.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or obfuscated code. The code adheres to standard practices for implementing a loss function. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a differentiable loss function used in segmentation tasks. It employs common tensor operations, leverages imported utilities for masking and one-hot encoding, and provides a class for easy integration into models. No external network calls, file operations, or system modifications are present. The logic appears consistent with standard practices, and there are no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of Tversky loss for segmentation, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe for inclusion in a project, assuming the imported utilities are trustworthy.",
