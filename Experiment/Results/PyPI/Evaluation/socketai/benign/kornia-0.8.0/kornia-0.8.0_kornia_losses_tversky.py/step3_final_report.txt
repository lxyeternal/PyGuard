  "purpose": "Implementation of the Tversky loss function for segmentation tasks, including utility functions for masking ignored pixels and one-hot encoding.",
  "sources": "Input tensors 'pred' and 'target', utility functions 'mask_ignore_pixels' and 'one_hot'.",
  "sinks": "Tensor operations within the module; no external data transmission or network activity.",
  "flows": "Predicted logits are softmaxed; target labels are masked and one-hot encoded; tensor operations compute the loss based on source data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected. External utility functions are assumed trustworthy.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of the Tversky loss function, with appropriate input validation, masking, and tensor operations. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or external malicious activity are present. The utility functions used are typical for such tasks and do not indicate malicious behavior. The overall security risk is minimal, primarily due to the reliance on external utilities, which are presumed safe. The malware score is zero, obfuscation score is zero, and the security risk score is conservatively set at 0.1, reflecting the low inherent risk of this utility code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of a segmentation loss function with no malicious payloads or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified. No further action is necessary.",
