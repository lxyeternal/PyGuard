{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom loss function (Tversky loss) for image segmentation tasks, including a class wrapper for use in training neural networks.",
  "sources": "Inputs: pred tensor (model outputs), target tensor (ground truth labels); imported modules (torch, torch.nn.functional, utils).",
  "sinks": "Loss computation involves tensor operations, softmax application, and masking; no direct sinks for untrusted data or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "Predictions and targets flow into loss calculation via softmax and masking; results produce a scalar loss value for optimization.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard for a loss function; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present; no obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, or misleading variables observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a well-structured Tversky loss, including input validation, masking for ignore indices, one-hot encoding, and tensor operations for loss calculation. It uses only standard PyTorch functions and utilities from imported modules. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code is typical for machine learning loss functions and aligns with known implementations. No external network calls or system modifications are included. All data flows are contained within tensor operations and are relevant for the loss calculation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate implementation of a neural network loss function with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is focused solely on loss computation and does not perform any suspicious or harmful operations.",
