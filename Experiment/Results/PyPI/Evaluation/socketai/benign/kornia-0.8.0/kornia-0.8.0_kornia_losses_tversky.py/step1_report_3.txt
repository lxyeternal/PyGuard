  "purpose": "Implementing a Tversky loss function for segmentation models in PyTorch, including a class wrapper for easy integration as a loss criterion.",
  "sources": "Input tensors: 'pred' and 'target' in functions and class methods; 'mask_ignore_pixels' utility; 'one_hot' utility.",
  "sinks": "Loss computation and backpropagation through 'torch.mean', 'torch.sum', 'F.softmax'. No direct untrusted data sinks like network or file I/O found.",
  "flows": "Input tensors ('pred' and 'target') are processed with softmax, masked, then used in arithmetic operations leading to the loss output. No external or untrusted data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears standard and well-structured. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious dynamic execution, or obfuscated logic. The only noteworthy aspect is the use of mask and one_hot functions which are common utilities.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a loss function for segmentation tasks based on Tversky index. It performs input validation, applies softmax, masks ignored pixels, converts targets to one-hot encoding, and calculates the loss using tensor operations. The class encapsulates this function with configurable parameters. No external malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. No network activity or system modification code is included. It is a typical deep learning loss module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of a segmentation loss function in PyTorch. It contains no malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. It appears safe for use in a production environment.",
