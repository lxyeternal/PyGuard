  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports consistently describe the code as a straightforward configuration module.\n- They highlight safe use of Enums, dataclasses, property setters, and directory path construction via os.path.join.\n- No external data sources, network calls, or handling of sensitive data are observed.\n- No suspicious or malicious code patterns, obfuscation, or backdoors are detected.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, and security risk scores are very low or zero.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), indicating the reviewers agree on the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious, obfuscated, or vulnerable behavior.\n- The logic is standard for configuration management.\n- Directory paths are constructed safely.\n- String inputs for `installation_mode` are validated and converted properly.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- No significant flaws or mistakes are evident.\n- The only minor point is that the `installation_mode` setter raises a `ValueError` if an invalid string is provided, which is appropriate and expected.\n\n### Scores and Reasonableness:\n- All reports assign `malware: 0`, which is consistent with the code's behavior.\n- The `securityRisk` scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.2), which is reasonable given the code's benign nature.\n- The `obfuscated` score is 0 across all reports, aligning with the clear, straightforward code.\n\n### Potential for Misinterpretation:\n- There are no claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions; all assessments are cautious and accurate.\n- The code does not perform any external actions or handle sensitive data, so no additional security concerns are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and well-structured.  \n**Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**Overall:** The code is a safe, standard configuration module with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBased on the detailed review, I agree with the reports' assessments. The code is benign and safe for use. No changes to the scores are necessary.",
