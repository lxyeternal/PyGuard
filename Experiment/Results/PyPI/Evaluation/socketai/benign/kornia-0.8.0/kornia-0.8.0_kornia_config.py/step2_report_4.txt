  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its behavior, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code defines configuration classes, enums, and directory paths for the Kornia project.\n- It uses standard Python practices: dataclasses, enums, property setters, os.path.join.\n- No external data input (beyond string assignments), network activity, or data leaks are evident.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.\n- The code appears to be a straightforward configuration module.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** None. All reports agree that the code is benign, well-structured, and standard.\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes:\n- **Errors or mistakes:** None identified across reports or in the code. The code correctly handles enum validation, property setting, and path construction.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk score:** Mostly 0, with one report giving 0.2, which is acceptable given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious activity.\n\n### Risk Justification:\n- Since no malicious behavior, external data exfiltration, or obfuscation is present, a **risk score of 0** is appropriate.\n- The small 0.2 score is perhaps overly cautious but still within reason for configuration code that handles environment variables and user input (though no such malicious intent exists).\n\n### Potential Vulnerabilities:\n- The only point of concern could be the `installation_mode` setter accepting arbitrary strings. However, it safely converts strings to enum members and raises errors on invalid input, which is good practice.\n- Directory paths are constructed with `os.path.join`, which is safe.\n- No external calls, network operations, or handling of sensitive data.\n\n### Consistency and Final Assessment:\n- The scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks beyond normal configuration handling.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n**Malware score:** **0** — No malicious code or behavior.\n**Obfuscated score:** **0** — Clear, straightforward code.\n**Risk score:** **0** — No security issues or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Note:** The reports are overly cautious but align with the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard, well-structured configuration module with no security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable, and I agree with their assessments.\n\n**Would you like me to generate a consolidated report or further analyze specific aspects?**",
