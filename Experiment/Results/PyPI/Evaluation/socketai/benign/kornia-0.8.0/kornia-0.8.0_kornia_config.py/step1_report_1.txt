  "purpose": "Define configuration classes and constants for managing installation modes and directory paths for the Kornia project.",
  "sources": "User input for installation_mode property; environment variables for directory paths (if used outside this snippet).",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data leaks, external calls, or sensitive information handling present.",
  "flows": "No external data flow from untrusted sources to critical functions; data flows are limited to internal configuration management.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or backdoors; proper use of Enum and dataclasses.",
  "analysis": "The code defines configuration classes with properties to set and get installation modes, including validation. Directory paths are constructed using os.path.join with fixed relative paths. There are no external inputs, network operations, or malicious code patterns. The code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured configuration module with no signs of malware or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration setup with no malicious behavior, no security risks, and no obfuscated or suspicious components. It serves its purpose of managing configuration options safely.",
