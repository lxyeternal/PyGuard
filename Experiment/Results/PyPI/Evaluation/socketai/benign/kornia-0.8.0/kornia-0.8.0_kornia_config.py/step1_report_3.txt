{
  "purpose": "Define configuration classes and default settings for Kornia, including installation modes and directory paths.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from string parameters in setters, environment variables via os.path.join during initialization.",
  "sinks": "os.path.join may process directory paths; no direct sink for untrusted data; no network or file access explicitly shown.",
  "flows": "Input strings (e.g., in installation_mode setter) flow into enum conversion, affecting class attributes, but no harmful operations occur.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network calls, or obfuscated code. The code performs straightforward configuration setup.",
  "analysis": "The code defines enums, data classes, and property setters to manage configuration options securely. The installation_mode setter converts strings to enum members, raising errors on invalid input. Directory paths are constructed via os.path.join, which is safe. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or privacy leaks are evident. The code appears standard and intentionally designed for configuration management without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code provides configuration management for Kornia with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard operations like input validation and directory path creation securely.",
