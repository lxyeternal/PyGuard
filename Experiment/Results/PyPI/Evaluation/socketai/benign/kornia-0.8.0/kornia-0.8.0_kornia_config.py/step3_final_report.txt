{
  "purpose": "Defines configuration classes, enums, and directory paths for the Kornia project, handling installation modes and directory locations in a safe manner.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string values, enum inputs via property setters, os.path.join for directory paths",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, network activity, or data leaks are present",
  "flows": "Input strings for installation_mode flow through the setter to enum conversion; directory paths are constructed from fixed strings",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; safe enum validation and path handling; no obfuscation or malicious code",
  "analysis": "The code employs safe practices: enum validation, property setters, and path joins. It does not process untrusted external data beyond internal string conversions. No network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code is straightforward configuration management with proper validation and no obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It is a standard configuration module employing safe coding practices.",
