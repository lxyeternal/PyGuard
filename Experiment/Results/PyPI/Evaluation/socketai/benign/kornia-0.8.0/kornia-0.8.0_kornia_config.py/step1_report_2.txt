  "purpose": "Define configuration classes and variables for managing installation modes and directory paths in the Kornia library.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, initializing default directory paths, and setting properties in class instances.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the property setter for 'installation_mode', which converts strings to enum values, but only performs safe enum conversions; no data leaks or unsafe actions observed.",
  "flows": "Input strings for 'installation_mode' flow through the setter, which converts them to enum values; no external data flow or network interaction is present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code appears to be straightforward configuration management.",
  "analysis": "The code defines enumerations and dataclasses for configuration management, including safe string-to-enum conversions and directory path setups. There are no indications of malicious code, hidden functionalities, or data exfiltration mechanisms. No network activity or obfuscated code is present. The use of property setters and default values is standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration setup for the Kornia library with no malicious intent or security risks. It only manages configuration data with safe practices.",
