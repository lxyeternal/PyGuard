  "purpose": "Define configuration classes and constants for managing installation modes and directory paths in the Kornia project.",
  "sources": "User input through the 'installation_mode' setter; environment variables via os.path.join for directory paths.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the 'installation_mode' value if misused or misconfigured, but only used internally for configuration logic.",
  "flows": "User or external input flows into 'installation_mode' setter, which influences '_installation_mode' attribute; directory paths are set via os.path.join.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. The code only manages configuration settings and does not perform any data transmission, file modification, or malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Enum for installation modes and a data class for configuration, including directory paths. The 'installation_mode' property allows setting via strings or Enum, with validation. Directory paths are constructed using os.path.join, which is standard. No code injection, network activity, or data exfiltration logic present. The code appears to be part of a configuration module, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious code segments.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a configuration setup for managing installation modes and directory paths. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. It is a straightforward configuration module with no security risks.",
