{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom loss function (Welsch loss) for use in neural network training, including a standalone function and a class wrapper.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__ for compatibility, imports Tensor from torch, and functions/classes from kornia.core and kornia.core.check modules.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data could lead to security issues. No network, file I/O, or environment variable usage observed.",
  "flows": "Input tensors (img1, img2) flow through validation checks to mathematical computation of loss; no external data or untrusted sources influence the flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors. The code performs standard loss calculation with proper validation.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a known loss function with validation checks ensuring tensor types, shape, device consistency, and valid reduction options. No external data or commands are executed. No malware signatures or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, well-structured, and free from malicious intent. It performs a standard loss calculation used in machine learning models. No security risks or malware behaviors identified.",
