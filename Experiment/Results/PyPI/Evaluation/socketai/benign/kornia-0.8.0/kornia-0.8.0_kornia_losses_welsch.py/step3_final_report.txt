  "purpose": "Implementation of the Welsch (Leclerc) loss function for tensor inputs, supporting different reduction modes.",
  "sources": "Tensor inputs 'img1' and 'img2', validation functions checking tensor type, shape, device, and reduction parameter.",
  "sinks": "Internal tensor computations; no external data transmission or system modification.",
  "flows": "Input tensors are validated, then used in mathematical loss calculation; no external data flows or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-documented implementation of a loss function used in deep learning. It performs standard input validation, computes the Welsch loss formula, and supports multiple reduction modes. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or external communication are present. The validation functions and mathematical operations are standard and safe. The class wrapper simply calls the functional implementation, maintaining clarity and correctness.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of the Welsch loss function with proper validation and documentation. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the critical reports (malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, low security risk) are accurate and appropriate.",
