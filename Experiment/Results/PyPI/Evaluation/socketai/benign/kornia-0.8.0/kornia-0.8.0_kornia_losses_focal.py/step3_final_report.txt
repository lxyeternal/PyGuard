  "purpose": "Implementation of focal loss functions for PyTorch, including class weighting, ignore index handling, and validation.",
  "sources": "Input tensors 'pred' and 'target', class weights, ignore index parameter, and optional alpha and gamma parameters.",
  "sinks": "Loss value returned; no external data leaks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Predictions processed via log_softmax; target labels converted to one-hot; masks applied; loss computed with optional weighting and reduction.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected; standard use of torch and Kornia utilities.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-documented implementation of focal loss functions, with proper validation and no signs of malicious activity. It uses standard tensor operations, proper device checks, and handles optional parameters correctly. No obfuscation or external communication is present. The code's purpose aligns with common loss function implementations, and no anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation of focal loss functions for PyTorch, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
