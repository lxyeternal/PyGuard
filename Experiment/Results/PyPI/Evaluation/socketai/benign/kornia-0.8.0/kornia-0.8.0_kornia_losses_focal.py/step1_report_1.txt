  "purpose": "Implementations of focal loss functions for training neural networks with PyTorch, including standard, class-weighted, and binary variants.",
  "sources": "Imports from torch, torch.nn, and Kornia libraries; function parameters for input tensors (predictions and targets); and optional weight tensors.",
  "sinks": "Calculation of loss values which could potentially be used maliciously to distort training if manipulated; no external data sinks or network communication present.",
  "flows": "Inputs (pred, target, optional weights) are processed through shape and device checks, then transformed into loss components; the loss is computed and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or hidden data manipulations; the license header is standard. Use of standard PyTorch and Kornia functions without obfuscation or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code implements well-known focal loss functions for classification tasks, with proper input validation and type checks. No external network operations, file modifications, or data leaks. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code behavior identified. The code appears to be a standard, open-source implementation for loss calculations, designed for safe use in neural network training. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of focal loss functions intended for neural network training. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe for use in production environments.",
