{
  "purpose": "Implement the Charbonnier loss function and a corresponding Module class for use in machine learning models.",
  "sources": "Imports from torch and kornia libraries; functions and class definitions that process tensors.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code performs standard tensor operations and checks.",
  "flows": "Input tensors (img1, img2) are validated, then used in loss computation, with optional reduction applied.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, suspicious logic, or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a loss function and a class that encapsulates it, utilizing standard tensor operations and validation checks. No external data sources, network calls, or file operations are present. The checks ensure tensor shapes and devices match, preventing obvious misuse. The implementation is consistent with typical machine learning loss functions and adheres to expected practices. There are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a loss function used in deep learning models. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe for use.",
