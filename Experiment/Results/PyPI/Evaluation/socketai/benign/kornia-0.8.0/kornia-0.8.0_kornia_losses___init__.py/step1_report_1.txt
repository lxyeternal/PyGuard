{
  "purpose": "This code defines a module that imports various loss functions and utility functions related to image processing, deep learning, and computer vision tasks, and exports them via __all__ for use in other parts of a project.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.cauchy, .charbonnier, etc.) and the __all__ list definition.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly handles untrusted data, user input, or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; this is a static module defining imports and exports only.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The license header is standard. The import and export patterns are typical for a Python package.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a license header and a series of import statements from local modules, followed by an explicit __all__ list to define public API symbols. There are no code execution, data processing, or network operations. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard package initialization module, exporting various loss functions for a deep learning library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks. The overall security risk is negligible.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
