{
  "purpose": "This module imports various loss functions and utilities from local modules and exposes them via the __all__ list for external use.",
  "sources": "Local module imports such as .cauchy, .charbonnier, .depth_smooth, etc.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no network or file I/O involved.",
  "flows": "Import statements from local modules to the module namespace; no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; standard import/export pattern with license header.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical __init__.py or module initializer that organizes and exposes functions/classes for a larger package. It contains only import statements and an explicit __all__ list, with no dynamic code execution, data handling, or network activity. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or secrets are present. The license header is standard. The code's purpose is purely structural, facilitating namespace management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It is a standard package setup module that exports loss functions for a machine learning library. All evidence indicates it is safe and free from security concerns.",
