{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python library (kornia) related to image processing and computer vision, setting up module imports, licensing info, and constants.",
  "sources": "The code reads static module imports, license comments, and version info. No external or untrusted data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points, as the code only imports modules and defines constants.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only loads modules and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are detected. The license header and import statements are standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a module initializer with license headers, import statements, and a version variable. It does not perform any runtime data processing, network communication, or dynamic code execution. All imports are from within the package or standard modules. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. The structure and content are consistent with typical open-source package setup files.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module setup script for the 'kornia' library. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. The risk of malware or security threats is negligible based on the provided content.",
