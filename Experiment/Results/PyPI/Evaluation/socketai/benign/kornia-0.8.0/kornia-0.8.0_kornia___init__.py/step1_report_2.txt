{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module initialization script for a Python library named Kornia, setting up imports, constants, and version information.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.filters, .geometry, etc.), constants, and utility functions from within the package.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks or external network communications are present in this code.",
  "flows": "N/A – the code primarily performs static imports and variable definitions; no runtime data flow or external data processing occurs here.",
  "anomalies": "There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious dynamic execution. All imports and variables are standard for a library setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple modules and functions, sets a version string, and exposes certain constants and utilities for external use. It does not perform any runtime input/output, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The license header indicates open-source distribution. No malicious behaviors, suspicious patterns, or anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This script functions as a standard package initializer for a Python library with no indications of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It is a straightforward setup script with no concerning elements.",
