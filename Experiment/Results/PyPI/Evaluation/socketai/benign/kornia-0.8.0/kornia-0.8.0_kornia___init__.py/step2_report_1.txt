  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose:** Describes the code as part of a Python library setup with imports and constants.  \n- **Findings:** No external input, no untrusted data, no sinks, no data flows, no anomalies.  \n- **Conclusion:** Standard library setup code, no malicious intent.  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is static, with no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0, security risk is 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Purpose:** Similar to report 1, a module initializer for Kornia.  \n- **Findings:** No external data, no dynamic code, no suspicious patterns.  \n- **Conclusion:** Standard package setup, benign.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct; no issues.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0, security risk is 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Purpose:** Again, a package import setup for Kornia.  \n- **Findings:** No external input, no dynamic execution, no anomalies.  \n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, typical structure.  \n- **Assessment:** Valid.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0, security risk is 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Purpose:** Organizing imports for Kornia.  \n- **Findings:** No data processing, no external communication, no anomalies.  \n- **Conclusion:** Standard package initialization.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0, security risk is 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Purpose:** Similar to previous, setting up module imports.  \n- **Findings:** No external data handling, no suspicious patterns.  \n- **Conclusion:** Typical setup code, no malicious activity.  \n- **Assessment:** Valid.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0, security risk is 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n- All reports correctly identify that this code is static, consisting solely of import statements, license headers, and constants.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, malware, or malicious behavior is present.\n- The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code.\n- The license headers and import order are standard and benign.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Note:** The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's nature as a straightforward package setup script.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is a benign, standard Python package initialization module with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security vulnerabilities.",
