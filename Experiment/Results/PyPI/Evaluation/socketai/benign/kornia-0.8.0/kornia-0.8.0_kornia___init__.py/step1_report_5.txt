{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up and organize imports for a Python package named 'kornia', related to image processing and computer vision tasks.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (.filters, .geometry, .grad_estimator, etc.) and specific functions/constants from submodules (kornia.constants, kornia.utils, etc.).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include imported functions that could process untrusted data, but no direct data handling or external network interactions are evident.",
  "flows": "The code primarily organizes module imports without executing any data flow or processing logic, so no source-to-sink data flow is present.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs. The license header and import structure are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of license headers and a series of import statements from various internal modules and submodules. It includes comments about import order and multi-framework support. No executable logic, input handling, or network communication is present. The import patterns are typical for a well-structured Python package, and no suspicious or malicious code is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package initialization script with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It primarily sets up the package namespace. No security concerns are identified.",
