{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python library for image processing and computer vision, providing imports and constants for use in the package.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules and external constants/utilities; no external input or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external output operations are present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only imports modules and defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns such as obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The license header and import structure are typical for a library.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly consists of license information, import statements, and a version variable. It imports various internal modules and some utilities, but there are no functions, data processing, or dynamic code execution that could be exploited. The import pattern and the lack of external data handling indicate standard library setup code. No hardcoded secrets, network operations, or suspicious behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup module for a Python library with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It serves to organize imports and define constants without performing any sensitive or potentially harmful operations.",
