  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initialization script for the Kornia library, importing core modules, utilities, constants, and setting version information.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules, constants, and utility functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external data or network communication.",
  "flows": "Static import statements and constant definitions; no data flow from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with license headers and import statements only.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static setup script with no dynamic execution, external input, or network activity. It only imports internal modules and defines constants, typical for package initialization. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The structure and content are standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initialization module with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identified its safe nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the code's static and straightforward structure.",
