  "purpose": "Implementation of fast distance covariance calculation using merge sort, optimized with Numba for performance.",
  "sources": "Input arrays 'x' and 'y' read via numpy operations such as argsort, cumsum, and array slicing.",
  "sinks": "No external I/O; data flows are within numerical computations, with no network or file system access.",
  "flows": "Data is sorted and processed internally; source arrays are sorted, sums computed, and results derived without external interaction.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard numerical operations for statistical measures, utilizing numpy and numba for acceleration. No signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The use of numpy functions on untrusted data could cause errors but does not indicate malicious intent. The code is modular, clear, and focused on statistical computation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, performance-optimized implementation of distance covariance calculation. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The high security risk scores in some reports are overestimations; a low risk score (~0.1-0.2) is more appropriate, mainly reflecting potential issues with untrusted inputs, not malicious intent.",
