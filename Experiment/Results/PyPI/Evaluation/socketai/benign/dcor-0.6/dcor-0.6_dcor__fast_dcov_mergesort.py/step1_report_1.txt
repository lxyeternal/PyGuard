{
  "purpose": "This code implements functions to compute the squared distance covariance using a fast merge sort algorithm, primarily for statistical analysis of the dependence between two variables.",
  "sources": "Input arrays 'x' and 'y' provided to various functions, reading their values and metadata; reading from imported modules (_dcor_internals_numba, _utils).",
  "sinks": "Data processed within functions, no evidence of data leaks or writing to external sources; no network or file I/O involved.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays through sorting and calculations to the final return values, with intermediate steps computing weight sums, row sums, and covariance terms.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. The code uses Numba for JIT compilation to optimize performance but not to obfuscate logic. No dynamic code execution or suspicious obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides methods to compute statistical measures (distance covariance) efficiently using merge sort and Numba for acceleration. It handles input validation, supports different compilation modes, and performs standard numerical operations. All data processing appears focused on statistical computation with no side-effects, external communications, or suspicious behaviors. There are no signs of malware such as data exfiltration, network connections, or backdoors. Usage of Numba for JIT compilation is intended for performance, not obfuscation. The overall structure is clear, modular, and aligns with typical numerical library practices.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a standard implementation of distance covariance calculations optimized with Numba. No malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks detected. The code appears to be a legitimate, performance-oriented numerical library component.",
