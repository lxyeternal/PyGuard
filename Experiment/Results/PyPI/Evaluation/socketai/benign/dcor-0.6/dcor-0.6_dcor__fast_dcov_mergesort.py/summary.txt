  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, performance-optimized implementation of distance covariance calculation. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The high security risk scores in some reports are overestimations; a low risk score (~0.1-0.2) is more appropriate, mainly reflecting potential issues with untrusted inputs, not malicious intent."
