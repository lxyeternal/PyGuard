{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to compute the squared distance covariance between two datasets using a mergesort-based algorithm, optimized with Numba JIT compilation for performance.",
  "sources": "Reads input arrays (__x and __y), input parameters (exponent, compile_mode, return_var_terms), and internally reads from arrays such as weights, y, and x during computations and sorting.",
  "sinks": "Performs mathematical operations and returns results; no direct data leaks or external system interactions are present. No functions write to files, send data over networks, or manipulate system resources.",
  "flows": "Inputs (__x and __y) are sorted and processed through several internal functions that compute weight sums and covariance terms. Data flows from input arrays through sorting, calculation, and accumulation steps, ultimately returning numeric results.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures are observed. Usage of Numba for JIT compilation is typical for performance optimization and not inherently malicious. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution is detected. The code is well-structured and performs mathematical computations securely.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple functions for computing distance covariance terms with optimizations using Numba. It reads input arrays for calculation, performs sorting, cumulative sums, and matrix operations. No suspicious behavior such as network activity, file access, or hidden backdoors is evident. The purpose appears to be performance-optimized statistical computation. No malicious code patterns or security vulnerabilities are identified within this scope.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a mathematical library for distance covariance computation, optimized with Numba. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided implementation. It appears to be a legitimate and optimized implementation for statistical analysis without any malicious intent.",
