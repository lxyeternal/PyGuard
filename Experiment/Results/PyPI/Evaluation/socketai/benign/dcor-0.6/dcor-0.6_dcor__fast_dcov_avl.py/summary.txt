  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured, high-performance implementation of distance covariance algorithms. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1), which is appropriate given the context."
