{
  "purpose": "The code implements fast distance covariance calculations using AVL trees and Numba for performance optimization, primarily for statistical analysis of numerical data.",
  "sources": "Data is read from numpy arrays, including input arrays 'x' and 'y', which are sorted and processed internally through array operations such as argsort, cumsum, and array indexing.",
  "sinks": "The code performs in-memory computations only; there are no external data leaks, network communications, or file I/O involved.",
  "flows": "Input arrays are sorted and transformed; internal variables track cumulative sums and indices; data flows through sorting, array manipulations, and JIT-compiled functions to produce the output results.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation tactics are present. The heavy use of Numba is for performance, not malicious concealment.",
  "analysis": "The code is a legitimate, optimized implementation of statistical distance covariance calculations. It processes data entirely within numpy arrays, utilizing sorting, cumulative sums, and JIT compilation for efficiency. No external system calls, network activity, or malicious behaviors are detected. The structure is clear, comments explain the purpose, and no suspicious patterns or obfuscation are evident. Input validation and assertions mitigate common vulnerabilities. The heavy use of Numba does not imply obfuscation but serves performance goals. Overall, the code is safe, transparent, and intended solely for statistical computation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured, high-performance implementation of distance covariance algorithms. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1), which is appropriate given the context.",
