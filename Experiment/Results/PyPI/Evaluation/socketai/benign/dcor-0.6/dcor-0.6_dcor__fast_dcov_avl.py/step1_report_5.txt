{
  "purpose": "The code implements fast distance covariance computations using AVL trees, with support for JIT compilation and optimized internal functions, primarily for statistical analysis or feature dependence measurement.",
  "sources": "Input data x and y are read from function arguments, primarily via numpy arrays. Data is sorted, indexed, and transformed internally using numpy functions and temporary arrays.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks for untrusted data such as network operations, file writes, or system calls. The code performs numerical computations without apparent data leakage or external communication.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays x and y through sorting, indexing, and internal transformation functions. The main computations involve cumulative sums, index-based updates, and numpy array manipulations. No external or untrusted data is used in critical operations, and there are no external data flows outside the scope of numerical processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears highly specialized and optimized for numerical computations, with heavy use of JIT compilation via numba. There are no signs of hidden backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or external network activity are present. The purpose and functions seem consistent with statistical analysis, not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily implements an optimized algorithm for calculating squared distance covariance using AVL trees and numba JIT compilation. The functions are focused on numerical data processing, including sorting, indexing, cumulative sums, and internal updates. No external communication, file access, or system manipulation code is present. The use of numpy and numba for performance is typical in scientific computing. There are no signs of malicious payloads, such as data exfiltration, system damage, or backdoors. The structure and variable names suggest a focus on statistical calculations, not hidden malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a statistical distance covariance algorithm optimized with JIT compilation. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or suspicious activity is detected. The purpose is clear and consistent with statistical analysis, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
