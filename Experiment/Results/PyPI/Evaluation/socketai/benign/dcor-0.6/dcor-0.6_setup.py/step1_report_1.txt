  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'dcor' Python package, including metadata and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Reading the version from the 'dcor/VERSION' file.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code primarily performs package setup operations.",
  "flows": "Reading version from file -> passing metadata to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It reads the package version from a file located at 'dcor/VERSION' and uses find_packages() to automatically discover packages. No external inputs are processed beyond reading a static version file, and there are no suspicious operations or code injections. The script performs typical package setup procedures with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security issues.",
