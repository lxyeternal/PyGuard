  "purpose": "Set up and configure the Python package 'dcor' by reading version info and defining package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from a file located at 'dcor/VERSION'.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data outputs or risky operations.",
  "flows": "Reading version file during setup, with no further data flow to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code; the comments are purely documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules for filesystem and package setup, reads the version string from a local file, and uses setuptools to define package parameters. No untrusted input, network operations, or potentially malicious logic are present. The code is straightforward and aligns with typical Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
